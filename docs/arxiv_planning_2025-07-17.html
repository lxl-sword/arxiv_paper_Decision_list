<p class='card-text'>Obstacle avoidance is essential for ensuring the safety of autonomous
vehicles. Accurate perception and motion planning are crucial to enabling
vehicles to navigate complex environments while avoiding collisions. In this
paper, we propose an efficient obstacle avoidance pipeline that leverages a
camera-only perception module and a Frenet-Pure Pursuit-based planning
strategy. By integrating advancements in computer vision, the system utilizes
YOLOv11 for object detection and state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation
models, such as Depth Anything V2, to estimate object distances. A comparative
analysis of these models provides valuable insights into their accuracy,
efficiency, and robustness in real-world conditions. The system is evaluated in
diverse scenarios on a university campus, demonstrating its effectiveness in
handling various obstacles and enhancing autonomous navigation. The video

<p class='card-text'>We consider manipulation problems in constrained and cluttered settings,
which require several regrasps at unknown locations. We propose to inform an

state space abstraction, a regrasp map, capturing the combinations of available
grasps in different parts of the configuration space, and allowing us to
provide the solver with guesses for the mode switches and additional
constraints for the object placements. By interleaving the creation of regrasp

<p class='card-text'>Forecasting Climate Policy Uncertainty (CPU) is essential as policymakers
strive to balance economic growth with environmental goals. High levels of CPU
can slow down investments in green technologies, make regulatory planning more
difficult, and increase public resistance to climate reforms, especially during
times of economic stress. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting the
US CPU index by building the Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model with
a large set of covariates, including economic indicators, financial cycle data,
and public sentiments captured through Google Trends. The key strength of the
BSTS model lies in its ability to efficiently manage a large number of
covariates through its dynamic feature selection mechanism based on the
spike-and-slab prior. To validate the effectiveness of the selected features of
the BSTS model, an impulse response analysis is performed. The results show
that macro-financial shocks impact CPU in different ways over time. Numerical
experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the BSTS model with
exogenous variables on the US CPU dataset over different forecasting horizons.
The empirical results confirm that BSTS consistently outperforms classical and
deep learning frameworks, particularly for semi-long-term and long-term
forecasts.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper proposes Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming, a

the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-16 12:12:25</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Trajectory planning involving multi-agent interactions has been a
long-standing challenge in the field of robotics, primarily burdened by the
inherent yet intricate interactions among agents. While game-theoretic methods
are widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent
interactions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating
the intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional
uncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing
game-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor
scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive
trajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties
of agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability.
As the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under
intentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its
agent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain
minor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive
trajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium
can be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we
present a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the
problem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant
outcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
is effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of
intentional uncertainties. Its scalability surpasses that of existing
centralized and decentralized baselines, allowing for real-time interactive
trajectory planning in uncertain game settings.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global
warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail
to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades
directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training
data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through
two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse
longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different
urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building
outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles
throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are
aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade
patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to
learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of
edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and
incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of
shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,
time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in
generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using
our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning
in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a
reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential
practical applications in the environment.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate 3D reconstruction of vehicles is vital for applications such as
vehicle inspection, predictive maintenance, and urban planning. Existing
methods like Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have shown
impressive results but remain limited by their reliance on dense input views,
which hinders real-world applicability. This paper addresses the challenge of
reconstructing vehicles from sparse-view inputs, leveraging depth maps and a
robust pose estimation architecture to synthesize novel views and augment
training data. Specifically, we enhance Gaussian Splatting by integrating a
selective photometric loss, applied only to high-confidence pixels, and
replacing standard Structure-from-Motion pipelines with the DUSt3R architecture
to improve camera pose estimation. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset
featuring both synthetic and real-world public transportation vehicles,
enabling extensive evaluation of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing the

<p class='card-text'>Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant
challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly
predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective,
advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly
incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction.
To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention
reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a
unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through
a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,
a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within
the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform
policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing
valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a
hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state
space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their
associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse
and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Sidewalk delivery robots are a promising solution for urban freight
distribution, reducing congestion compared to trucks and providing a safer,
higher-capacity alternative to drones. However, unreliable travel times on
sidewalks due to pedestrian density, obstacles, and varying infrastructure
conditions can significantly affect their efficiency. This study addresses the
robust route planning problem for sidewalk robots, explicitly accounting for
travel time uncertainty due to varying sidewalk conditions. Optimization is
integrated with simulation to reproduce the effect of obstacles and pedestrian
flows and generate realistic travel times. The study investigates three
different approaches to derive uncertainty sets, including budgeted,
ellipsoidal, and support vector clustering (SVC)-based methods, along with a
distributionally robust method to solve the shortest path (SP) problem. A
realistic case study reproducing pedestrian patterns in Stockholm's city center
is used to evaluate the efficiency of robust routing across various robot
designs and environmental conditions. The results show that, when compared to a
conventional SP, robust routing significantly enhances operational reliability
under variable sidewalk conditions. The Ellipsoidal and DRSP approaches
outperform the other methods, yielding the most efficient paths in terms of
average and worst-case delay. Sensitivity analyses reveal that robust
approaches consistently outperform the conventional SP, particularly for
sidewalk delivery robots that are wider, slower, and have more conservative
navigation behaviors. These benefits are even more pronounced in adverse
weather conditions and high pedestrian congestion scenarios.</p>

collisions. This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety
of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step
denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor
noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection
based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the
generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a
single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed
while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible
application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the
autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently

<p class='card-text'>Diffusion Models have shown remarkable proficiency in image and video
synthesis. As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid
edge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast
inference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates
high-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage
refinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while
insufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge
model output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates
cloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the
optimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality.
Specifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud
inference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud
inference periodically to adjust errors. Then we design a two-stage greedy
search algorithm to efficiently find the optimal parameters for noise
approximation and edge model switching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that

<p class='card-text'>Motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dense traffic is

that overlook the fact that agents often adapt their behavior in response to
the AV's actions. To address this, we propose Interaction-Aware Neural

<p class='card-text'>Grasping unknown objects from a single view has remained a challenging topic
in robotics due to the uncertainty of partial observation. Recent advances in
large-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.
However, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in
performance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental
changes. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,
we abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:
similarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the
grasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly
achieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key
steps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform
similarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,
identifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate
models with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the
unknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local
fine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy
observation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that
integrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive
evaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,
the C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between
partial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database
models. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce
the semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration

<p class='card-text'>Real-time path planning in dense, uncertain environments remains a
challenging problem, as predicting the future motions of numerous dynamic
obstacles is computationally burdensome and unrealistic. To address this, we
introduce Hybrid Prediction-based Risk-Aware Planning (HyPRAP), a
prediction-based risk-aware path-planning framework which uses a hybrid
combination of models to predict local obstacle movement. HyPRAP uses a novel
Prediction-based Collision Risk Index (P-CRI) to evaluate the risk posed by
each obstacle, enabling the selective use of predictors based on whether the
agent prioritizes high predictive accuracy or low computational prediction
overhead. This selective routing enables the agent to focus on high-risk
obstacles while ignoring or simplifying low-risk ones, making it suitable for
environments with a large number of obstacles. Moreover, HyPRAP incorporates
uncertainty quantification through hybrid conformal prediction by deriving
confidence bounds simultaneously achieved by multiple predictions across
different models. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that HyPRAP effectively
balances safety and computational efficiency by leveraging the diversity of
prediction models. Extensive simulations validate these insights for more
general settings, confirming that HyPRAP performs better compared to single
predictor methods, and P-CRI performs better over naive proximity-based risk
assessment.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Load balancing plays a pivotal role in cloud computing, ensuring that
resources are optimally allocated to maintain high service quality and
operational efficiency. As workloads in cloud environments become increasingly
dynamic and unpredictable, load balancing strategies are evolving from
traditional static methods to more adaptive and intelligent approaches. In this
study, the Cloud Analyst simulation tool was used to evaluate the performance
of different load balancing algorithms under various scenarios, including both
centralized and distributed resource setups. The results highlight that while
the Round Robin algorithm yields slightly better processing times within a
single data center, Equally Spread and Throttled techniques perform
competitively, especially when network latency is considered. More importantly,
when resources are distributed across multiple data centers, response times are
significantly reduced, emphasizing the value of proximity and efficient load
distribution. In these distributed environments, Equally Spread and Throttled
algorithms not only maintain quick response times but also contribute to lower
operational costs. These findings demonstrate the necessity of strategic
resource placement and proactive infrastructure planning to balance performance

challenging due to intensity variations across modalities and spatial
misalignment caused by inconsistent slice acquisition protocols. We propose
CAA-Seg, a composite alignment-aware framework that addresses these challenges

method that dynamically identifies and aligns anatomically corresponding slice

  Tethered Robots and Its Extended Applications</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Tethered robots play a pivotal role in specialized environments such as
disaster response and underground exploration, where their stable power supply
and reliable communication offer unparalleled advantages. However, their motion
planning is severely constrained by tether length limitations and entanglement
risks, posing significant challenges to achieving optimal path planning. To
address these challenges, this study introduces CDT-TCS (Convex Dissection
Topology-based Tethered Configuration Search), a novel algorithm that leverages
CDT Encoding as a homotopy invariant to represent topological states of paths.
By integrating algebraic topology with geometric optimization, CDT-TCS
efficiently computes the complete set of optimal feasible configurations for
tethered robots at all positions in 2D environments through a single
computation. Building on this foundation, we further propose three
application-specific algorithms: i) CDT-TPP for optimal tethered path planning,
ii) CDT-TMV for multi-goal visiting with tether constraints, iii) CDT-UTPP for
distance-optimal path planning of untethered robots. All theoretical results
and propositions underlying these algorithms are rigorously proven and
thoroughly discussed in this paper. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in their
respective problem domains. Furthermore, real-world experiments on robotic
platforms validate the practicality and engineering value of the proposed
framework.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The rapid adoption of micromobility solutions, particularly two-wheeled
vehicles like e-scooters and e-bikes, has created an urgent need for reliable
autonomous riding (AR) technologies. While autonomous driving (AD) systems have
matured significantly, AR presents unique challenges due to the inherent
instability of two-wheeled platforms, limited size, limited power, and
unpredictable environments, which pose very serious concerns about road users'
safety. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of AR systems by
systematically examining their core components, perception, planning, and
control, through the lens of AD technologies. We identify critical gaps in
current AR research, including a lack of comprehensive perception systems for
various AR tasks, limited industry and government support for such
developments, and insufficient attention from the research community. The
review analyses the gaps of AR from the perspective of AD to highlight
promising research directions, such as multimodal sensor techniques for
lightweight platforms and edge deep learning architectures. By synthesising
insights from AD research with the specific requirements of AR, this review
aims to accelerate the development of safe, efficient, and scalable autonomous
riding systems for future urban mobility.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-16 00:51:50</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The turnover scale of the power spectrum is related to the size of the
particle horizon at the matter-radiation equality, which can be used as a
standard ruler to constrain cosmological parameters. In this work, we apply a
model-independent method to mock datasets to forecast constraints on the
turnover scale below a redshift of 0.5, investigating for the first time with a
multi-tracer approach. We find that combining the galaxy density with peculiar
velocity does not improve the turnover scale constraints for current or
currently planned surveys because either the cosmological volume or the
effective number density of peculiar velocities is too low. However, we
demonstrate that when combining the galaxy power spectrum from 4HS with the HI
power spectrum from SKA1-B2, the constraints on the turnover scale improve by
$\sim30\%$ compared to using only a single tracer. We demonstrate for the first
time that combining DESI, 4HS, and an SKA Phase 1 Band 2 survey could achieve a
$\sim5\%$ level constraint on the turnover scale and a $\sim90\%$ probability
of detecting the turnover below a redshift of 0.5. Lastly, we also demonstrate
that combining the DESI BGS redshift sample with the LRG, ELG, and QSO samples
could break the degeneracy between $r_H$ and $\Omega_m$ and improve their
constraints by $\sim25\%$ and $\sim45\%$, respectively, compared to only using
the high redshift samples. The constraints on the particle horizon at the
matter-radiation equality $r_H$ and the matter density $\Omega_m$ could then
further improve by $\sim20\%$ and $\sim30\%$, respectively, when combining the
full set of DESI redshift tracers with 4HS and SKA1-B2.</p>

introduce a simple mathematical formulation of six basic and broadly accepted

Hebbian plasticity, local inhibition, and inter-area inhibition. We implement a
simulated neuromorphic system based on this formalism, which is capable of
basic language acquisition: Starting from a tabula rasa, the system learns, in
any language, the semantics of words, their syntactic role (verb versus noun),

<p class='card-text'>Follow-up of gravitational-wave events by wide-field surveys is a crucial
tool for the discovery of electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave
sources, such as kilonovae. Machine learning tools can play an important role
in aiding search efforts. We have developed a public tool to predict kilonova
light curves using simulated low-latency alert data from the International
Gravitational Wave Network during observing runs 4 (O4) and 5 (O5). It uses a
bidirectional long-short-term memory (LSTM) model to forecast kilonova light
curves from binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers in the
Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space
and Time filters. The model achieves a test mean squared error (MSE) of 0.19
for ZTF filters and 0.22 for Rubin filters, calculated by averaging the squared
error over all time steps, filters, and light curves in the test set. We verify
the performance of the model against merger events followed-up by the ZTF
partnership during O4a and O4b. We also analyze the effect of incorporating
skymaps and constraints on physical features such as ejecta mass through a
hybrid convolutional neural network and LSTM model. Using ejecta mass, the
performance of the model improves to an MSE of 0.1. However, using full skymap
information results in slightly lower model performance. Our models are
publicly available and can help to add important information to help plan
follow-up of candidate events discovered by current and next-generation public
surveys.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion
and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and
automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs
are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative
on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on
two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal
car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral
lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human
factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a
HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based
on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model
based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the
elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and
efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The
findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in
enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging
process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption
compared with benchmarks.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-15 17:21:31</h6>
<p class='card-text'>To meet the increasing demand of deep learning (DL) models, AI chips are
employing both off-chip memory (e.g., HBM) and high-bandwidth low-latency
interconnect for direct inter-core data exchange. However, it is not easy to
explore the efficiency of these inter-core connected AI (ICCA) chips, due to a
fundamental tussle among compute (per-core execution), communication
(inter-core data exchange), and I/O (off-chip data access).
  In this paper, we develop Elk, a DL compiler framework to maximize the
efficiency of ICCA chips by jointly trading off all the three performance
factors discussed above. Elk structures these performance factors into
configurable parameters and forms a global trade-off space in the DL compiler.
To systematically explore this space and maximize overall efficiency, Elk
employs a new inductive operator scheduling policy and a cost-aware on-chip
memory allocation algorithm. It generates globally optimized execution plans
that best overlap off-chip data loading and on-chip execution. To examine the
efficiency of Elk, we build a full-fledged emulator based on a real ICCA chip
IPU-POD4, and an ICCA chip simulator for sensitivity analysis with different
interconnect network topologies. Elk achieves 94% of the ideal roofline
performance of ICCA chips on average, showing the benefits of supporting large
DL models on ICCA chips. We also show Elk's capability of enabling architecture
design space exploration for new ICCA chip development.</p>

  Modulo Theories: A Scalable Approach to Routing and Vehicle Circulation</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-15 17:02:03</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper introduces a novel approach for jointly solving the periodic Train
Timetabling Problem (TTP), train routing, and Vehicle Circulation Problem (VCP)
through a unified optimization model. While these planning stages are
traditionally addressed sequentially, their interdependencies often lead to
suboptimal vehicle usage. We propose the VCR-PESP, an integrated formulation
that minimizes fleet size while ensuring feasible and infrastructure-compliant
periodic timetables. We present the first Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT)-based method for the VCR-PESP to solve the resulting large-scale
instances. Unlike the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT), which requires time
discretisation, SMT supports continuous time via difference constraints,
eliminating the trade-off between temporal precision and encoding size. Our
approach avoids rounding artifacts and scales effectively, outperforming both
SAT and Mixed Integer Program (MIP) models across non-trivial instances. Using
real-world data from the Swiss narrow-gauge operator RhB, we conduct extensive
experiments to assess the impact of time discretisation, vehicle circulation
strategies, route flexibility, and planning integration. We show that discrete
models inflate vehicle requirements and that fully integrated solutions
substantially reduce fleet needs compared to sequential approaches. Our
framework consistently delivers high-resolution solutions with tractable
runtimes, even in large and complex networks. By combining modeling accuracy
with scalable solver technology, this work establishes SMT as a powerful tool
for integrated railway planning. It demonstrates how relaxing discretisation
and solving across planning layers enables more efficient and implementable
timetables.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate characterization of vascular geometry is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional statistical shape
modeling (SSM) methods rely on linear assumptions, limiting their expressivity
and scalability to complex topologies such as multi-branch vascular structures.
We introduce HUG-VAS, a Hierarchical NURBS Generative model for Vascular
geometry Synthesis, which integrates NURBS surface parameterization with
diffusion-based generative modeling to synthesize realistic, fine-grained
aortic geometries. Trained with 21 patient-specific samples, HUG-VAS generates
anatomically faithful aortas with supra-aortic branches, yielding biomarker
distributions that closely match those of the original dataset. HUG-VAS adopts
a hierarchical architecture comprising a denoising diffusion model that
generates centerlines and a guided diffusion model that synthesizes radial
profiles conditioned on those centerlines, thereby capturing two layers of
anatomical variability. Critically, the framework supports zero-shot
conditional generation from image-derived priors, enabling practical
applications such as interactive semi-automatic segmentation, robust
reconstruction under degraded imaging conditions, and implantable device
optimization. To our knowledge, HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to bridge
image-derived priors with generative shape modeling via a unified integration
of NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion processes.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We propose a multi-robot control paradigm to solve point-to-point navigation
tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment
information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high
frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing
collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in
multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal
trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their
assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation
from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables
the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an
instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast
state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack
(Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and
