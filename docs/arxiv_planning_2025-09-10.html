<p class='card-text'>Patient-specific computational models of the heart are powerful tools for
cardiovascular research and medicine, with demonstrated applications in
treatment planning, device evaluation, and surgical decision-making. Yet
constructing such models is inherently difficult, reflecting the extraordinary
complexity of the heart itself. Numerous considerations are required, including
reconstructing the anatomy from medical images, representing myocardial
mesostructure, capturing material behavior, defining model geometry and
boundary conditions, coupling multiple physics, and selecting numerical
methods. Many of these choices involve a tradeoff between physiological
fidelity and modeling complexity. In this review, we summarize recent advances
and unresolved questions in each of these areas, with particular emphasis on
cardiac tissue mechanics. We argue that clarifying which complexities are
essential, and which can be safely simplified, will be key to enabling clinical
translation of these models.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Many robotic manipulation tasks require sensing and responding to force
signals such as torque to assess whether the task has been successfully
completed and to enable closed-loop control. However, current
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle
physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to
bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating
torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate
several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque
adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the
encoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in
autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which
further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a
physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation
benchmarks validate our findings.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves
competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task
environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of
ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available

role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD

<p class='card-text'>Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-09 12:22:21</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Efficient exploration of unknown environments is crucial for autonomous
robots, especially in confined and large-scale scenarios with limited
communication. To address this challenge, we propose a collaborative
exploration framework for a marsupial ground-aerial robot team that leverages
the complementary capabilities of both platforms. The framework employs a
graph-based path planning algorithm to guide exploration and deploy the aerial
robot in areas where its expected gain significantly exceeds that of the ground
robot, such as large open spaces or regions inaccessible to the ground
platform, thereby maximizing coverage and efficiency. To facilitate large-scale
spatial information sharing, we introduce a bandwidth-efficient, task-driven
map compression strategy. This method enables each robot to reconstruct
resolution-specific volumetric maps while preserving exploration-critical
details, even at high compression rates. By selectively compressing and sharing
key data, communication overhead is minimized, ensuring effective map
integration for collaborative path planning. Simulation and real-world
experiments validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in
improving exploration efficiency while significantly reducing data
transmission.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In robots task and motion planning (TAMP), it is crucial to sample within the
robot's configuration space to meet task-level global constraints and enhance
the efficiency of subsequent motion planning. Due to the complexity of joint
configuration sampling under multi-level constraints, traditional methods often
lack efficiency. This paper introduces the principle of RobKiNet, a
kinematics-informed neural network, for end-to-end sampling within the
Continuous Feasible Set (CFS) under multiple constraints in configuration
space, establishing its Optimization Expectation Model. Comparisons with
traditional sampling and learning-based approaches reveal that RobKiNet's
kinematic knowledge infusion enhances training efficiency by ensuring stable
and accurate gradient optimization.Visualizations and quantitative analyses in
a 2-DOF space validate its theoretical efficiency, while its application on a
9-DOF autonomous mobile manipulator robot(AMMR) demonstrates superior
whole-body and decoupled control, excelling in battery disassembly tasks.
RobKiNet outperforms deep reinforcement learning with a training speed 74.29
times faster and a sampling accuracy of up to 99.25%, achieving a 97.33% task
completion rate in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Clinical trials with time-to-event endpoints, such as overall survival (OS)
or progression-free survival (PFS), are fundamental for evaluating new
treatments, particularly in immuno-oncology. However, modern therapies, such as
immunotherapies and targeted treatments, often exhibit delayed effects that
challenge traditional trial designs. These delayed effects violate the
proportional hazards assumption, which underpins standard statistical methods
like the Cox proportional hazards model and the log-rank test. Careful planning
is essential to ensure trials are appropriately designed to account for the
timing and magnitude of these effects. Without this planning, interim analyses
may lead to premature trial termination if the treatment effect is
underestimated early in the study. We present an adaptive trial design
framework that incorporates prior distributions, elicited from experts, for
delayed treatment effects. By addressing the uncertainty surrounding delayed
treatment effects, our approach enhances trial efficiency and robustness,
minimizing the risk of premature termination and improving the detection of
treatment benefits over time. We present an example illustrating how interim
analyses, informed by prior distributions, can guide early stopping decisions.
To facilitate the implementation of our framework, we have developed free,
open-source software that enables researchers to integrate prior distributions
into trial planning and decision-making. This software provides a flexible,
accessible tool for designing trials that more accurately evaluate modern
therapies through adaptive trial designs.</p>

equal selection probability for constituents ex ante.
  We develop several algorithms for this problem. Although minimizing the

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous vehicles must navigate dynamically uncertain environments while
balancing the safety and driving efficiency. This challenge is exacerbated by
the unpredictable nature of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HVs) and
perception inaccuracies, which require planners to adapt to evolving
uncertainties while maintaining safe trajectories. Overly conservative planners
degrade driving efficiency, while deterministic approaches may encounter
serious issues and risks of failure when faced with sudden and unexpected
maneuvers. To address these issues, we propose a real-time contingency
trajectory optimization framework in this paper. By employing event-triggered
online learning of HV control-intent sets, our method dynamically quantifies
multi-modal HV uncertainties and refines the forward reachable set (FRS)
incrementally. Crucially, we enforce invariant safety through FRS-based barrier
constraints that ensure safety without reliance on accurate trajectory
prediction of HVs. These constraints are embedded in contingency trajectory
optimization and solved efficiently through consensus alternative direction
method of multipliers (ADMM). The system continuously adapts to the
uncertainties in HV behaviors, preserving feasibility and safety without
resorting to excessive conservatism. High-fidelity simulations on highway and
urban scenarios, as well as a series of real-world experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in driving efficiency and passenger comfort while
maintaining safety under uncertainty. The project page is available at

<p class='card-text'>The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling seamless

By integrating IoT with computer vision, the smart fridge employs an ESP32-CAM
to establish a monitoring subsystem that enhances food management efficiency

monitoring. This benefits waste reduction, grocery planning improvement, and
household consumption optimization. In high-density inventory conditions,
capturing partial or layered images complicates object detection, as
overlapping items and occluded views hinder accurate identification and
counting. Besides, varied angles and obscured details in multi-layered setups
reduce algorithm reliability, often resulting in miscounts or
misclassifications. Our proposed system is structured into three core modules:
data pre-processing, object detection and management, and a web-based

overconfident predictions, we implement a variant of focal loss that mitigates
over-confidence and under-confidence in multi-category classification. This

<p class='card-text'>Problem definition: We study a workforce redeployment problem in hospital
networks, where clinical staff, such as nurses, are temporarily reassigned from
overstaffed to understaffed sites to address short-term imbalances. This
practice of ``internal travel,'' which gained traction during the COVID-19
pandemic to tackle nurse shortages, presents new operational challenges that
require tailored analytical support. Key requirements such as advance notice
and short-term secondments must be incorporated. Moreover, in rapidly evolving
environments, reliance on historical data leads to unreliable forecasts,
limiting the effectiveness of traditional sample-based methods. Methodology: We
formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program and incorporate demand
uncertainty via a sample robust optimization (SRO) framework. Using linear
decision rule approximation, we reformulate the problem as a tractable linear
program. Results: We evaluate the impact of key network design components on
system performance. Network connectivity has the largest effect in reducing the
total cost, number of redeployments, and travel distance, but its benefits
depend on aligning the secondment duration with the network structure. Full
connectivity without proper secondments can be counterproductive. The SRO
approach outperforms the traditional sample-average method in the presence of
demand surges or under-forecasts by better anticipating emergency
redeployments. Managerial implications: Internal travel programs offer a
promising strategy to alleviate workforce shortages in healthcare systems. Our

<p class='card-text'>In this article, we investigate the bound orbits of the timelike particles
and the gravitational waveforms emitted from these orbits around a
renormalization group improved Kerr black hole in the framework of the
asymptotic safety approach. The running Newton coupling in the metric is
characterized by two free quantum parameters $(\omega,\,\gamma)$ arsing from
the non-perturbative renormalization group theory and the appropriate cutoff
identification, respectively. As expected, the radii of the horizon, the
marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable orbit are all decrease as the
quantum parameters increase. Under the extreme mass-ratio inspirals
approximation the deviation of gravitational waveforms radiated by the periodic
orbits from those in the classical Kerr background increases with the two
quantum parameter. However, this effect is much smaller in the retrograde case
compared to the prograde case. Especially, by comparing the characteristic
strain of those gravitational wave with the sensitivity curve of several
potential detectors, we find that their characteristic frequencies can fall
within the sensitivity ranges of several planned gravitational wave
observatories, suggesting that such signals may be detectable with sufficient
instrumental sensitivity.</p>

by analyzing the results of 30,000 planning and navigation trials in simulation

kinematically challenging terrain maps and twenty combinations of seven
path-planning parameters. In simulation, our MUONS-equipped AGV achieved a 0.98

correlation analysis we determined that the Bi-RRT expansion radius used in the
initial planning stages is most correlated with performance in terms of
planning time and traversed path length. Finally, we observed that the

<p class='card-text'>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will
provide a windfall of new transients and variable sources. Here we have
performed mock observation simulations to understand LSST's expected detection
rates for cataclysmic variables (CVs) with known large amplitude variations.
Under the thin-disk approximation for the distribution of CVs in our Galaxy, we
found that only 20% of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae systems, representing the most
energetic disk-driven outbursts in CVs, will be detected during outbursts by
the LSST. Given their large amplitude (7-9 mag), {only those} brighter than
$17.5$ mag at outburst maximum are expected to have an r-band quiescence
counterpart in individual scans. Thanks to the planned cadence of the LSST
towards the Galactic center, ~70% of the simulated outbursts will be detected
twice or more on the discovery night, and two-thirds will be observed in
different bands. CVs of the Polar class, which display luminosity changes up to
4 mag, can be unbiasedly recovered to 22.5 mag with more than 100 detections
over 10 years of the LSST operation. Finally, we attempt to characterize the
detection rate of micronovae bursts, and find that about 2.6%} of the simulated
sample will be observed as a >= 0.4 mag-amplitude and <= 1-d duration spike in
the long-term light curve. Overall, our results consolidate LSST's capability
to studying time-domain phenomena in CVs, and inform on how to plan and

<p class='card-text'>Accurate estimation of the frequency and magnitude of successive extreme
events in energy demand is critical for strategic resource planning.
Traditional approaches based on extreme value theory (EVT) are typically
limited to modelling isolated extreme events and struggle to capture the
dynamics of temporally clustered extremes, such as those driven by prolonged
extreme weather events. These limitations are exacerbated by the scarcity of
historical data and computational costs of longrun simulations leading to high
uncertainty in return level estimates for successive extremes. Here, we
introduce a novel statistical framework leveraging recent theoretical advances
in successive extreme value modelling in dynamical systems. Under reasonable
assumptions of the time series data (e.g. the data follow a fat-tailed
Fr\'{e}chet distribution), our tool allows for significantly more robust
estimates of returns and magnitudes of successive extreme events compared to
standard likelihood methods. We illustrate our statistical workflow on
scenarios of forecasted gas supply levels from 2025 to 2050. Common measures of
statistical accuracy are provided as benchmarks for comparison.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This chapter extends the family of perception-informed gap-based local
planners to dynamic environments. Existing perception-informed local planners
that operate in dynamic environments often rely on emergent or empirical
robustness for collision avoidance as opposed to performing formal analysis of
dynamic obstacles. This proposed planner, dynamic gap, explicitly addresses
dynamic obstacles through several steps in the planning pipeline. First, polar
regions of free space known as gaps are tracked and their dynamics are
estimated in order to understand how the local environment evolves over time.
Then, at planning time, gaps are propagated into the future through novel gap
propagation algorithms to understand what regions are feasible for passage.
Lastly, pursuit guidance theory is leveraged to generate local trajectories
that are provably collision-free under ideal conditions. Additionally,
obstacle-centric ungap processing is performed in situations where no gaps
exist to robustify the overall planning framework. A set of gap-based planners
are benchmarked against a series of classical and learned motion planners in
dynamic environments, and dynamic gap is shown to outperform all other
baselines in all environments. Furthermore, dynamic gap is deployed on a
TurtleBot2 platform in several real-world experiments to validate collision
avoidance behaviors.</p>

strategies, careful tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency

significant performance boosts while maintaining solution correctness. Through
systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B,
DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are
demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an

inference speed across all tested models. This framework systematically
searches parameter spaces including temperature (0.1-0.5), reasoning steps

optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.
Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced
reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency without compromising
accuracy. DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest accuracy at 98%, while Mixtral-8x22B
delivers the most cost-effective performance at 361.5 tokens per accurate

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) traditionally focuses on collision avoidance,
but many real-world applications require active coordination between agents to
improve team performance. This paper introduces Team Coordination on Graphs
with Risky Edges (TCGRE), where agents collaborate to reduce traversal costs on
high-risk edges via support from teammates. We reformulate TCGRE as a 3D
matching problem-mapping robot pairs, support pairs, and time steps-and
rigorously prove its NP-hardness via reduction from Minimum 3D Matching. To
address this complexity, (in the conference version) we proposed efficient
decomposition methods, reducing the problem to tractable subproblems:
Joint-State Graph (JSG): Encodes coordination as a single-agent shortest-path
problem. Coordination-Exhaustive Search (CES): Optimizes support assignments
via exhaustive pairing. Receding-Horizon Optimistic Cooperative A* (RHOCA*):
Balances optimality and scalability via horizon-limited planning. Further in
this extension, we introduce a dynamic graph construction method
(Dynamic-HJSG), leveraging agent homogeneity to prune redundant states and
reduce computational overhead by constructing the joint-state graph
dynamically. Theoretical analysis shows Dynamic-HJSG preserves optimality while
lowering complexity from exponential to polynomial in key cases. Empirical
results validate scalability for large teams and graphs, with HJSG
outperforming baselines greatly in runtime in different sizes and types of
graphs. This work bridges combinatorial optimization and multi-agent planning,
offering a principled framework for collaborative pathfinding with provable
guarantees, and the key idea of the solution can be widely extended to many
other collaborative optimization problems, such as MAPF.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous multi-finger grasping is a fundamental capability in robotic
manipulation. Optimization-based approaches show strong performance, but tend
to be sensitive to initialization and are potentially time-consuming. As an
alternative, the generator-evaluator-planner framework has been proposed. A
generator generates grasp candidates, an evaluator ranks the proposed grasps,
and a motion planner plans a trajectory to the highest-ranked grasp. If the
planner doesn't find a trajectory, a new trajectory optimization is started
with the next-best grasp as the target and so on. However, executing
lower-ranked grasps means a lower chance of grasp success, and multiple
trajectory optimizations are time-consuming. Alternatively, relaxing the
threshold for motion planning accuracy allows for easier computation of a
successful trajectory but implies lower accuracy in estimating grasp success
likelihood. It's a lose-lose proposition: either spend more time finding a
successful trajectory or have a worse estimate of grasp success. We propose a
framework that plans trajectories to a set of generated grasp targets in
parallel, the evaluator estimates the grasp success likelihood of the resulting
trajectories, and the robot executes the trajectory most likely to succeed. To
plan trajectories to different targets efficiently, we propose the use of a
vectorized motion planner. Our experiments show our approach improves over the
traditional generator-evaluator-planner framework across different objects,
generators, and motion planners, and successfully generalizes to novel
environments in the real world, including different shelves and table heights.

<p class='card-text'>Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable
environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical
motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full
environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural
motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop
directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or
dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural
motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic
environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is
IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million
generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further
improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher
finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at
inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We
evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving
obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,
outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both

central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to
short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,
we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual
foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a
Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,
foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,

synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By
forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation
as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that
implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable
capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset
comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training
scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual
foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive

However, navigating confined waterways presents unique challenges, including
