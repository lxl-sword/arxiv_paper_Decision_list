<p class='card-text'>The proposed Very Large Area Space Telescope (VLAST), with its expected
unprecedented sensitivity in the MeV-GeV range, can also address the
longstanding "MeV Gap" in gamma-ray observations. We explore the capability of
VLAST to detect sub-GeV leptophilic dark matter (DM) annihilation, focusing on
scalar and vector mediators and emphasizing the resonance region where the
mediator mass is approximately twice the DM mass. While $s$-wave annihilation
is tightly constrained by relic density and cosmic microwave background
observations, $p$-wave and mixed $(s+p)$-wave scenarios remain viable,
particularly near resonance. Additionally, direct detection experiments,
especially those probing DM-electron scattering, significantly constrain
nonresonance parameter space but are less effective in the resonance regime.
VLAST can uniquely probe this surviving region, outperforming existing and
planned instruments, and establishing itself as a crucial tool for indirect
detection of thermal relic DM.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In order to broaden the adoption of highly-demanded quantum functionalities
such as QKD, there is a need for having quantum signals coexist with classical
traffic over the same physical medium, typically optical fibers in
already-deployed networks. Beyond the experimental point-to-point
demonstrations of the past few years, efforts are now underway to integrate QKD
at the network level: developing interfaces with the software-defined-network
ecosystem; but also network planning tools that satisfy physical-layer
contraints jointly on the classical and quantum signals. We have found that in
certain situations, na\"ive network planning prioritizing quantum traffic
drastically degrades classical capacity, whereas a quantum-aware wavelength
assignment heuristic allows coexistence with minimal impact on both capacities.
More such techniques will be required to enable widespread deployment of QKD

<p class='card-text'>Efficient view planning is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and
robotic perception, critical for tasks ranging from search and rescue
operations to autonomous navigation. While classical approaches, including
sampling-based and deterministic methods, have shown promise in planning camera
viewpoints for scene exploration, they often struggle with computational
scalability and solution optimality in complex settings. This study introduces
HQC-NBV, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for view planning that leverages
quantum properties to efficiently explore the parameter space while maintaining
robustness and scalability. We propose a specific Hamiltonian formulation with
multi-component cost terms and a parameter-centric variational ansatz with
bidirectional alternating entanglement patterns that capture the hierarchical
dependencies between viewpoint parameters. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that quantum-specific components provide measurable performance
advantages. Compared to the classical methods, our approach achieves up to
49.2% higher exploration efficiency across diverse environments. Our analysis
of entanglement architecture and coherence-preserving terms provides insights
into the mechanisms of quantum advantage in robotic exploration tasks. This
work represents a significant advancement in integrating quantum computing into
robotic perception systems, offering a paradigm-shifting solution for various
robot vision tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>High-resolution energy consumption and emissions datasets are essential for
localized policy-making, resource optimization, and climate action planning.
They enable municipalities to monitor mitigation strategies and foster
engagement among governments, businesses, and communities. However, smaller
municipalities often face data limitations that hinder tailored climate

emissions data at the local administrative level for Germany and Spain. Using
national datasets, we apply spatial disaggregation techniques with open data
sources. A key innovation is the application of XGBoost for imputing missing

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-08 09:35:27</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The majority of electric vehicles (EVs) are charged domestically overnight,
where the precise timing of power allocation is not important to the user, thus
representing a source of flexibility that can be leveraged by charging control
algorithms. In this paper, we relax the common assumption, that EVs require
full charge every morning, enabling additional flexibility to defer charging of
surplus energy to subsequent nights, which can enhance the performance of
controlled charging. In particular, we consider a simple domestic smart plug,
scheduling power delivery with the objective to minimize CO$_2$ emissions over
prediction horizons of multiple sessions -- up to seven days ahead -- utilising
model predictive control (MPC). Based on carbon intensity data from the UK
National Grid, we demonstrate significant potential for emission reductions
with multi-session planning of 40 to 46\% compared to uncontrolled charging and
19 to 26\% compared to single-session planning. Furthermore, we assess, how the
driving and charging behaviour of EV users affects the available flexibility
and consequentially the potential for emission reductions. Finally, using grid
carbon intensity data from 14 different UK regions, we report significant
variations in absolute emission reductions based on the local energy mix.</p>

  and Irregular Plantations</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Weijie Kuang, Hann Woei Ho, Ye Zhou</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-08 06:52:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is vital in precision agriculture to improve
efficiency and resource utilization. In irregular and dispersed plantations,
traditional grid-based CPP often causes redundant coverage over non-vegetated
areas, leading to waste and pollution. To overcome these limitations, we
propose CPP-DIP, a multi-objective CPP framework designed for Micro Air
Vehicles (MAVs). The framework transforms the CPP task into a Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) and optimizes flight paths by minimizing travel
distance, turning angles, and intersection counts. Unlike conventional
approaches, our method does not rely on GPS-based environmental modeling.
Instead, it uses aerial imagery and a Histogram of Oriented Gradients
(HOG)-based approach to detect trees and extract image coordinates. A
density-aware waypoint strategy is applied: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
used to reduce redundant waypoints in dense regions, while a greedy algorithm
ensures complete coverage in sparse areas. To verify the generality of the
framework, we solve the resulting TSP using three different methods: Greedy
Heuristic Insertion (GHI), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Monte Carlo
Reinforcement Learning (MCRL). Then an object-based optimization is applied to
further refine the resulting path. Additionally, CPP-DIP integrates ForaNav,
our insect-inspired navigation method, for accurate tree localization and
tracking. The experimental results show that MCRL offers a balanced solution,
reducing the travel distance by 16.9 % compared to ACO while maintaining a
similar performance to GHI. It also improves path smoothness by reducing
turning angles by 28.3 % and 59.9 % relative to ACO and GHI, respectively, and
effectively eliminates intersections. These results confirm the robustness and
effectiveness of CPP-DIP in different TSP solvers.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We present a vehicle system capable of navigating safely and efficiently
around Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and cyclists. The
system comprises key modules for environment perception, localization and
mapping, motion planning, and control, integrated into a prototype vehicle. A
key innovation is a motion planner based on Topology-driven Model Predictive
Control (T-MPC). The guidance layer generates multiple trajectories in
parallel, each representing a distinct strategy for obstacle avoidance or
non-passing. The underlying trajectory optimization constrains the joint
probability of collision with VRUs under generic uncertainties. To address
extraordinary situations ("edge cases") that go beyond the autonomous
capabilities - such as construction zones or encounters with emergency
responders - the system includes an option for remote human operation,
supported by visual and haptic guidance. In simulation, our motion planner
outperforms three baseline approaches in terms of safety and efficiency. We
also demonstrate the full system in prototype vehicle tests on a closed track,
both in autonomous and remotely operated modes.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper proposes a novel Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) and Model
Predictive Control (MPC) integration framework that delivers both task
scalability and safety for Autonomous Driving (AD). LVLMs excel at high-level
task planning across diverse driving scenarios. However, since these foundation
models are not specifically designed for driving and their reasoning is not
consistent with the feasibility of low-level motion planning, concerns remain
regarding safety and smooth task switching. This paper integrates LVLMs with
MPC Builder, which automatically generates MPCs on demand, based on symbolic
task commands generated by the LVLM, while ensuring optimality and safety. The
generated MPCs can strongly assist the execution or rejection of LVLM-driven
task switching by providing feedback on the feasibility of the given tasks and
generating task-switching-aware MPCs. Our approach provides a safe, flexible,
and adaptable control framework, bridging the gap between cutting-edge
foundation models and reliable vehicle operation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach through a simulation experiment, showing that our
system can safely and effectively handle highway driving while maintaining the

<p class='card-text'>Robotic dexterous in-hand manipulation, where multiple fingers dynamically
make and break contact, represents a step toward human-like dexterity in
real-world robotic applications. Unlike learning-based approaches that rely on
large-scale training or extensive data collection for each specific task,
model-based methods offer an efficient alternative. Their online computing
nature allows for ready application to new tasks without extensive retraining.
However, due to the complexity of physical contacts, existing model-based
methods encounter challenges in efficient online planning and handling modeling
errors, which limit their practical applications. To advance the effectiveness
and robustness of model-based contact-rich in-hand manipulation, this paper
proposes a novel integrated framework that mitigates these limitations. The
integration involves two key aspects: 1) integrated real-time planning and
tracking achieved by a hierarchical structure; and 2) joint optimization of
motions and contacts achieved by integrated motion-contact modeling.
Specifically, at the high level, finger motion and contact force references are
jointly generated using contact-implicit model predictive control. The
high-level module facilitates real-time planning and disturbance recovery. At
the low level, these integrated references are concurrently tracked using a
hand force-motion model and actual tactile feedback. The low-level module
compensates for modeling errors and enhances the robustness of manipulation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
model-based methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and real-time
performance. Our method successfully completes five challenging tasks in
real-world environments, even under appreciable external disturbances.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The miniaturisation of sensors and processors, the advancements in connected

boosting the affirmation of autonomous nano-size drones in the Internet of
Robotic Things ecosystem. However, achieving safe autonomous navigation and
high-level tasks such as exploration and surveillance with these tiny platforms
is extremely challenging due to their limited resources. This work focuses on
enabling the safe and autonomous flight of a pocket-size, 30-gram platform
called Crazyflie 2.1 in a partially known environment. We propose a novel
AI-aided, vision-based reactive planning method for obstacle avoidance under
the ambit of Integrated Sensing, Computing and Communication paradigm. We deal
with the constraints of the nano-drone by splitting the navigation task into
two parts: a deep learning-based object detector runs on the edge (external
hardware) while the planning algorithm is executed onboard. The results show
the ability to command the drone at $\sim8$ frames-per-second and a model
performance reaching a COCO mean-average-precision of $60.8$. Field experiments
demonstrate the feasibility of the solution with the drone flying at a top
speed of $1$ m/s while steering away from an obstacle placed in an unknown
position and reaching the target destination. The outcome highlights the
compatibility of the communication delay and the model performance with the
requirements of the real-time navigation task. We provide a feasible

<p class='card-text'>We study load balancing for a queueing system where parallel stations are
distant from customers. In the presence of traveling delays, the
join-the-shortest-queue (JSQ) policy induces queue length oscillations and
prolongs the mean waiting time. A variant of the JSQ policy, dubbed the
randomized join-the-shortest-queue (RJSQ) policy, is devised to mitigate the
oscillation phenomenon. By the RJSQ policy, customers are sent to each station
with a probability approximately proportional to its service capacity; only a
small fraction of customers are purposely routed to the shortest queue. The
additional probability of routing a customer to the shortest queue, referred to
as the balancing fraction, dictates the policy's performance. When the
balancing fraction is within a certain range, load imbalance between the
stations is negligible in heavy traffic, so that complete resource pooling is
achieved. We specify the optimal order of magnitude for the balancing fraction,
by which heuristic formulas are proposed to fine-tune the RJSQ policy. A joint
problem of capacity planning and load balancing is considered for
geographically separated stations. With well planned service capacities, the
RJSQ policy sends all but a small fraction of customers to the nearest
stations, rendering the system asymptotically equivalent to an aggregated
single-server system with all customers having minimum traveling delays. If
each customer's service requirement does not depend on the station, the RJSQ
policy is asymptotically optimal for reducing workload.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper proposes vehicle motion planning methods with obstacle avoidance
in tight spaces by incorporating polygonal approximations of both the vehicle
and obstacles into a model predictive control (MPC) framework. Representing
these shapes is crucial for navigation in tight spaces to ensure accurate
collision detection. However, incorporating polygonal approximations leads to
disjunctive OR constraints in the MPC formulation, which require a mixed
integer programming and cause significant computational cost. To overcome this,
we propose two different collision-avoidance constraints that reformulate the
disjunctive OR constraints as tractable conjunctive AND constraints: (1) a
Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based formulation that recasts collision avoidance
as a SVM optimization problem, and (2) a Minimum Signed Distance to Edges

both methods through extensive simulations, including tight-space parking

AOI delimitation by global search and collision detection. Experiments on

tracing their evolution from cross-modal learning architectures to generalist
agents that tightly integrate vision-language models (VLMs), action planners,
and hierarchical controllers. Our methodology adopts a rigorous literature
review framework, covering over 80 VLA models published in the past three
years. Key progress areas include architectural innovations,
parameter-efficient training strategies, and real-time inference accelerations.
We explore diverse application domains such as humanoid robotics, autonomous
vehicles, medical and industrial robotics, precision agriculture, and augmented
reality navigation. The review further addresses major challenges across
real-time control, multimodal action representation, system scalability,
generalization to unseen tasks, and ethical deployment risks. Drawing from the
state-of-the-art, we propose targeted solutions including agentic AI
adaptation, cross-embodiment generalization, and unified neuro-symbolic
planning. In our forward-looking discussion, we outline a future roadmap where
VLA models, VLMs, and agentic AI converge to power socially aligned, adaptive,
and general-purpose embodied agents. This work serves as a foundational
reference for advancing intelligent, real-world robotics and artificial general
intelligence. >Vision-language-action, Agentic AI, AI Agents, Vision-language

<p class='card-text'>We report on the status of charged lepton flavor violating (CLFV) experiments
with muons. We focus on the three "golden channels": $\mu^{+} \rightarrow e^{+}
\gamma$, $\mu^{+} \rightarrow e^{+} e^{-} e^{+}$ and $\mu^{-} N \rightarrow
e^{-} N$. The collection of upcoming experiments aim for sensitivity
improvements up to $10^{4}$ with respect to previous searches. The MEG II
experiment, searching for $\mu^{+} \rightarrow e^{+} \gamma$, is currently in
its 4th year of physics data-taking with a published result from its first year
of data. The Mu3e experiment is an upcoming experiment searching for $\mu^{+}
\rightarrow e^{+} e^{-} e^{+}$ with plans of physics data-taking as soon as
2025. The Mu2e and COMET experiments are upcoming searches for $\mu^{-} N
\rightarrow e^{-} N$ with the goal of physics data-taking starting in 2027 and
2026 respectively. This proceeding summarizes the signal signature, expected
background, resolutions, and timelines for the mentioned searches.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Model-based planning and execution systems offer a principled approach to
building flexible autonomous robots that can perform diverse tasks by
automatically combining a host of basic skills. This idea is almost as old as
modern robotics. Yet, while diverse general-purpose reasoning architectures
have been proposed since, general-purpose systems that are integrated with
modern robotic platforms have emerged only recently, starting with the
influential ROSPlan system. Since then, a growing number of model-based systems
for robot task-level control have emerged. In this paper, we consider the
diverse design choices and issues existing systems attempt to address, the
different solutions proposed so far, and suggest avenues for future

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-07 13:20:36</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The planning and operation of renewable energy, especially wind power, depend
crucially on accurate, timely, and high-resolution weather information.
Coarse-grid global numerical weather forecasts are typically downscaled to meet
these requirements, introducing challenges of scale inconsistency, process
representation error, computation cost, and entanglement of distinct
uncertainty sources from chaoticity, model bias, and large-scale forcing. We
address these challenges by learning the climatological distribution of a
target wind farm using its high-resolution numerical weather simulations. An
optimal combination of this learned high-resolution climatological prior with
coarse-grid large scale forecasts yields highly accurate, fine-grained,
full-variable, large ensemble of weather pattern forecasts. Using observed
meteorological records and wind turbine power outputs as references, the
proposed methodology verifies advantageously compared to existing
numerical/statistical forecasting-downscaling pipelines, regarding either
deterministic/probabilistic skills or economic gains. Moreover, a 100-member,
10-day forecast with spatial resolution of 1 km and output frequency of 15 min
takes < 1 hour on a moderate-end GPU, as contrast to $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ CPU
hours for conventional numerical simulation. By drastically reducing
computational costs while maintaining accuracy, our method paves the way for
more efficient and reliable renewable energy planning and operation.</p>

  Vehicle</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Petr Jahoda, Jan Cech</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-07 13:17:05</h6>
<p class='card-text'>A novel approach to detect road surface anomalies by visual tracking of a
preceding vehicle is proposed. The method is versatile, predicting any kind of
road anomalies, such as potholes, bumps, debris, etc., unlike direct
observation methods that rely on training visual detectors of those cases. The
method operates in low visibility conditions or in dense traffic where the
anomaly is occluded by a preceding vehicle. Anomalies are detected
predictively, i.e., before a vehicle encounters them, which allows to
pre-configure low-level vehicle systems (such as chassis) or to plan an
avoidance maneuver in case of autonomous driving. A challenge is that the
signal coming from camera-based tracking of a preceding vehicle may be weak and
disturbed by camera ego motion due to vibrations affecting the ego vehicle.
Therefore, we propose an efficient method to compensate camera pitch rotation
by an iterative robust estimator. Our experiments on both controlled setup and
normal traffic conditions show that road anomalies can be detected reliably at
a distance even in challenging cases where the ego vehicle traverses imperfect
road surfaces. The method is effective and performs in real time on standard
consumer hardware.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-07 12:03:15</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Machine Ethics decisions should consider the implications of uncertainty over
decisions. Decisions should be made over sequences of actions to reach
preferable outcomes long term. The evaluation of outcomes, however, may invoke
one or more moral theories, which might have conflicting judgements. Each
theory will require differing representations of the ethical situation. For
example, Utilitarianism measures numerical values, Deontology analyses duties,
and Virtue Ethics emphasises moral character. While balancing potentially
conflicting moral considerations, decisions may need to be made, for example,
to achieve morally neutral goals with minimal costs. In this paper, we
formalise the problem as a Multi-Moral Markov Decision Process and a
Multi-Moral Stochastic Shortest Path Problem. We develop a heuristic algorithm
based on Multi-Objective AO*, utilising Sven-Ove Hansson's Hypothetical
Retrospection procedure for ethical reasoning under uncertainty. Our approach
is validated by a case study from Machine Ethics literature: the problem of
whether to steal insulin for someone who needs it.</p>

  discrete optimal transport and general linear programs</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Shuyu Liu, Florentina Bunea, Jonathan Niles-Weed</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-07 10:55:14</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This work proposes new estimators for discrete optimal transport plans that
enjoy Gaussian limits centered at the true solution. This behavior stands in
stark contrast with the performance of existing estimators, including those
based on entropic regularization, which are asymptotically biased and only
satisfy a CLT centered at a regularized version of the population-level plan.
We develop a new regularization approach based on a different class of penalty
functions, which can be viewed as the duals of those previously considered in
the literature. The key feature of these penalty schemes it that they give rise
to preliminary estimates that are asymptotically linear in the penalization
strength. Our final estimator is obtained by constructing an appropriate linear
combination of two penalized solutions corresponding to two different tuning
parameters so that the bias introduced by the penalization cancels out. Unlike
classical debiasing procedures, therefore, our proposal entirely avoids the
delicate problem of estimating and then subtracting the estimated bias term.
Our proofs, which apply beyond the case of optimal transport, are based on a
novel asymptotic analysis of penalization schemes for linear programs. As a
corollary of our results, we obtain the consistency of the naive bootstrap for
fully data-driven inference on the true optimal solution. Simulation results
and two data analyses support strongly the benefits of our approach relative to
existing techniques.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cloud security concerns have been greatly realized in recent years due to the
increase of complicated threats in the computing world. Many traditional
solutions do not work well in real-time to detect or prevent more complex
threats. Artificial intelligence is today regarded as a revolution in
determining a protection plan for cloud data architecture through machine
learning, statistical visualization of computing infrastructure, and detection
of security breaches followed by counteraction. These AI-enabled systems make
work easier as more network activities are scrutinized, and any anomalous
behavior that might be a precursor to a more serious breach is prevented. This
paper examines ways AI can enhance cloud security by applying predictive
analytics, behavior-based security threat detection, and AI-stirring
encryption. It also outlines the problems of the previous security models and
how AI overcomes them. For a similar reason, issues like data privacy, biases
in the AI model, and regulatory compliance are also covered. So, AI improves
the protection of cloud computing contexts; however, more efforts are needed in
the subsequent phases to extend the technology's reliability, modularity, and
ethical aspects. This means that AI can be blended with other new computing
technologies, including blockchain, to improve security frameworks further. The
paper discusses the current trends in securing cloud data architecture using AI
and presents further research and application directions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Quadcopters are versatile aerial robots gaining popularity in numerous
critical applications. However, their operational effectiveness is constrained
by limited battery life and restricted flight range. To address these
challenges, autonomous drone landing on stationary or mobile charging and
battery-swapping stations has become an essential capability. In this study, we
present NMPC-Lander, a novel control architecture that integrates Nonlinear
Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with Control Barrier Functions (CBF) to achieve
precise and safe autonomous landing on both static and dynamic platforms. Our
approach employs NMPC for accurate trajectory tracking and landing, while
simultaneously incorporating CBF to ensure collision avoidance with static
obstacles. Experimental evaluations on the real hardware demonstrate high
precision in landing scenarios, with an average final position error of 9.0 cm

Motivated by this, we present PyRoki: a modular, extensible, and cross-platform

interface for specifying kinematic variables and costs with an efficient
nonlinear least squares optimizer. Unlike existing tools, it is also
cross-platform: optimization runs natively on CPU, GPU, and TPU. In this paper,
we present (i) the design and implementation of PyRoki, (ii) motion retargeting
