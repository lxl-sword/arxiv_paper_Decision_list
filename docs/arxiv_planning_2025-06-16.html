  Transport with Applications to Dynamic Single-cell Genomics Data</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Binghao Yan, Hongzhe Li</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have enabled the
profiling of gene expression for a collection of cells across time during a
dynamic biological process. Given that each time point provides only a static
snapshot, modeling and understanding the underlying cellular dynamics remains a
central yet challenging task in modern genomics. To associate biological time
with single cell distributions, we develop a robust local Fr\'echet regression
for interpolating the high-dimensional cellular distribution at any given time
point using data observed over a finite time points. To allow for robustness in
cell distributions, we propose to apply the unbalanced optimal transport-based
Wasserstein distance in our local Fr\'echet regression analysis. We develop a
computationally efficient algorithm to generate the cell distribution for a
given time point using generative neural networks. The resulting single cell
generated models and the corresponding transport plans can be use to
interpolate the single cells at any unobserved time point and to track the cell
trajectory during the cell differentiation process. We demonstrate the methods
using three single cell differentiation data sets, including differentiation of
human embryonic stem cells into embryoids, mouse hematopoietic and progenitor
cell differentiation, and reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We show
that the proposed methods lead to better single cell interpolations, reveal
different cell differential trajectories, and identify early genes that
regulate these cell trajectories.</p>

  Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer using Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-13 17:07:30</h6>
<p class='card-text'>High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of
locally advanced cervical cancer but remains highly dependent on manual
treatment planning expertise. The objective of this study is to develop a fully
automated HDR brachytherapy planning framework that integrates reinforcement
learning (RL) and dose-based optimization to generate clinically acceptable
treatment plans with improved consistency and efficiency. We propose a
hierarchical two-stage autoplanning framework. In the first stage, a deep
Q-network (DQN)-based RL agent iteratively selects treatment planning
parameters (TPPs), which control the trade-offs between target coverage and
organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The agent's state representation includes both
dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics and current TPP values, while its reward
function incorporates clinical dose objectives and safety constraints,
including D90, V150, V200 for targets, and D2cc for all relevant OARs (bladder,
rectum, sigmoid, small bowel, and large bowel). In the second stage, a
customized Adam-based optimizer computes the corresponding dwell time
distribution for the selected TPPs using a clinically informed loss function.
The framework was evaluated on a cohort of patients with complex applicator
geometries. The proposed framework successfully learned clinically meaningful
TPP adjustments across diverse patient anatomies. For the unseen test patients,
the RL-based automated planning method achieved an average score of 93.89%,
outperforming the clinical plans which averaged 91.86%. These findings are
notable given that score improvements were achieved while maintaining full
target coverage and reducing CTV hot spots in most cases.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Automatic segmentation of anatomical structures is critical in medical image
analysis, aiding diagnostics and treatment planning. Skin segmentation plays a
key role in registering and visualising multimodal imaging data. 3D skin
segmentation enables applications in personalised medicine, surgical planning,
and remote monitoring, offering realistic patient models for treatment
simulation, procedural visualisation, and continuous condition tracking. This
paper analyses and compares algorithmic and AI-driven skin segmentation
approaches, emphasising key factors to consider when selecting a strategy based
on data availability and application requirements. We evaluate an iterative
region-growing algorithm and the TotalSegmentator, a deep learning-based
approach, across different imaging modalities and anatomical regions. Our tests
show that AI segmentation excels in automation but struggles with MRI due to
its CT-based training, while the graphics-based method performs better for MRIs
but introduces more noise. AI-driven segmentation also automates patient bed
removal in CT, whereas the graphics-based method requires manual intervention.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a leading cause of disability worldwide,
requiring advanced diagnostic and therapeutic tools for personalised assessment
and treatment. Effective management of MSDs involves the interaction of
heterogeneous data sources, making the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm a valuable
option. This paper introduces the Musculoskeletal Digital Twin (MS-DT), a novel
framework that integrates multiscale biomechanical data with computational
modelling to create a detailed, patient-specific representation of the
musculoskeletal system. By combining motion capture, ultrasound imaging,
electromyography, and medical imaging, the MS-DT enables the analysis of spinal
kinematics, posture, and muscle function. An interactive visualisation platform
provides clinicians and researchers with an intuitive interface for exploring
biomechanical parameters and tracking patient-specific changes. Results
demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-DT in extracting precise kinematic and
dynamic tissue features, offering a comprehensive tool for monitoring spine
biomechanics and rehabilitation. This framework provides high-fidelity
modelling and real-time visualization to improve patient-specific diagnosis and

  Robots In Smart Manufacturing</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Ziren Xiao, Ruxin Xiao, Chang Liu, Xinheng Wang</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-13 12:37:26</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The collaboration and interaction of multiple robots have become integral
aspects of smart manufacturing. Effective planning and management play a
crucial role in achieving energy savings and minimising overall costs. This
paper addresses the real-time Dynamic Multiple Sources to Single Destination
(DMS-SD) navigation problem, particularly with a material distribution case for
multiple intelligent robots in smart manufacturing. Enumerated solutions, such
as in \cite{xiao2022efficient}, tackle the problem by generating as many
optimal or near-optimal solutions as possible but do not learn patterns from
the previous experience, whereas the method in \cite{xiao2023collaborative}
only uses limited information from the earlier trajectories. Consequently,
these methods may take a considerable amount of time to compute results on
large maps, rendering real-time operations impractical. To overcome this
challenge, we propose a lightweight Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to
address the DMS-SD problem. The proposed DRL method can be efficiently trained
and rapidly converges to the optimal solution using the designed target-guided
reward function. A well-trained DRL model significantly reduces the computation
time for the next movement to a millisecond level, which improves the time up
to 100 times in our experiments compared to the enumerated solutions. Moreover,
the trained DRL model can be easily deployed on lightweight devices in smart
manufacturing, such as Internet of Things devices and mobile phones, which only
require limited computational resources.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-13 12:35:56</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) are a GNN-based approach for
learning value functions that can generalise to unseen problems from a given
planning domain. R-GNNs were theoretically motivated by the well known
connection between the expressive power of GNNs and $C_2$, first-order logic
with two variables and counting. In the context of planning, $C_2$ features
refer to the set of formulae in $C_2$ with relations defined by the unary and
binary predicates of a planning domain. Some planning domains exhibit optimal
value functions that can be decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2$
features. We show that, contrary to empirical results, R-GNNs cannot learn
value functions defined by $C_2$ features. We also identify prior GNN
architectures for planning that may better learn value functions defined by
$C_2$ features.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The next generation of radio surveys is going to be transformative for
cosmology and other aspects of our understanding of astrophysics. Realistic
simulations of radio observations are essential for the design and planning of
radio surveys. They are employed in the development of methods for tasks, such
as data calibration and reduction, automated analysis and statistical studies
in cosmology. We implemented a software for machine learning-assisted
simulations of realistic surveys with the LOFAR telescope, resulting in a
synthetic radio sky model and a corresponding artificial telescope observation.
We employed a diffusion model trained on LoTSS observations to generate
individual radio galaxy images with control over the angular size. Single
sources are assembled into a radio sky model, using an input catalog from
cosmological simulations. We then transformed this sky model into visibilities
corresponding to a typical LoTSS pointing. We added realistic noise to this
synthetic measurement and obtained our final simulated sky maps through
deconvolution. We explored different ways to evaluate our resulting sky model.
We were able to simulate realistic LOFAR observations, covering a sky patch of
5x5 degrees at an effective resolution of 8.5 arcseconds. The simulated sources
have flux and size distributions that match real observations, and the
resulting maps have sensitivities compatible with LoTSS observations. Our
diffusion model is able to synthesize high-quality realistic radio galaxy
images with precise control over the source sizes. This software can readily be
applied to other instruments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>To evaluate methodological challenges and regulatory considerations of
indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) with the analysis of international health
technology assessment guidelines and French Transparency Committee (TC)
decisions. We conducted a pragmatic review of ITC guidelines from major health
technology assessment (HTA) bodies and multistakeholder organizations. Then, we
analyzed TC opinions published between 2021-2023. We extracted data on ITC
methodology, therapeutic areas, acceptability, and limitations expressed by the
TC. The targeted review of the main guidelines showed mainly agreements between
HTA bodies and multistakeholder organizations, with some specificities. 138 TC
opinions containing 195 ITCs were analyzed. Only 13.3% of these ITCs influenced
TC decision-making. ITCs were more frequently accepted in genetic diseases
(34.4%) compared to oncology (10.0%) and autoimmune diseases (11.1%). Methods
using individual patient data showed higher acceptance rates (23.1%) than
network meta-analyses (4.2%). Main limitations included heterogeneity/bias risk
(59%), lack of data (48%), statistical methodology issues (29%), study design
concerns (27%), small sample size (25%), and outcome definition variability
(20%). When ITCs were the primary source of evidence, the proportion of
important clinical benefit was lower (60.9% vs. 73.4%) than when randomized
controlled trials were available. While ITCs are increasingly submitted,
particularly where direct evidence is impractical, their influence on
reimbursement decisions remains limited. There is a need for clear and
accessible guides so manufacturers can produce clearer and more robust ITCs
that follow regulatory guidelines, from the planning phase to execution.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-13 07:24:36</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper is concerned with a discounted stochastic optimal control problem
for regime switching diffusion in an infinite horizon. First, as a preliminary
with particular interests in its own right, the global well-posedness of
infinite horizon forward and backward stochastic differential equations with
Markov chains and the asymptotic property of their solutions when time goes to
infinity are obtained. Then, a sufficient stochastic maximum principle for
optimal controls is established via a dual method under certain convexity
condition of the Hamiltonian. As an application of our maximum principle, a
linear quadratic production planning problem is solved with an explicit
feedback optimal production rate. The existence and uniqueness of a
non-negative solution to the associated algebraic Riccati equation are proved.
Numerical experiments are reported to illustrate the theoretical results,
especially, the monotonicity of the value function on various model parameters.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-13 04:10:48</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes
of mortality worldwide. Precise segmentation of coronary arteries from invasive
coronary angiography (ICA) is critical for effective clinical decision-making.
Objective: This study aims to propose a novel deep learning model based on
frequency-domain analysis to enhance the accuracy of coronary artery
segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, thereby offering robust support for
the stenosis detection and treatment of CAD. Methods: We propose the
Frequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates
a frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy
to fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation
accuracy. Specifically, FAD-Net employs a Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA)
mechanism in the frequency domain, computing the similarity between queries and
keys across high- and low-frequency components in ICAs. Furthermore, a
Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) is incorporated to decompose ICAs into
low- and high-frequency components via multi-level wavelet transformation.
Subsequently, it refines fine-grained arterial branches and edges by
reintegrating high-frequency details via inverse fusion, enabling continuous
enhancement of anatomical precision. Results and Conclusions: Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717
in coronary artery segmentation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art
methods. In addition, it attains a true positive rate of 0.6140 and a positive
predictive value of 0.6398 in stenosis detection, underscoring its clinical
applicability. These findings suggest that FAD-Net holds significant potential
to assist in the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of CAD.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-13 02:39:01</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In end-to-end autonomous driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role
in ego-vehicle planning. However, existing methods often rely on globally
aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are
primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing
to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and
undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel
end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local
neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations.
Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents
Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a
graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion
dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion
queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring
agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning.
Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive
benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD
achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by
41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The rapid increase in satellite launches in recent years, and the pressure of
launches planned into the next decade, demands an improvement in the efficiency
of space domain awareness facilities. Optical facilities form an important
component of global space domain awareness capabilities, however traditional
optical telescopes are restricted to observing satellites during a small
twilight window. In this work we explore expanding this operational period to
encompass the entire day to dramatically improve the observing opportunities at
a single site. We explore daytime space domain awareness observations with the
Huntsman Telescope Pathfinder, an instrument built using predominantly off the
self components, and Canon telephoto lenses. We report successful detections
and photometric light curves of 81 Starlink satellites from Sun altitudes
ranging 20 degrees to midday. Starlink satellites are found to be particularly
bright at $3.6 \pm 0.05$ mag, $\sigma = 0.6 \pm 0.05$ mag in Sloan r', or $\sim
11\times$ brighter than twilight conditions. We conclude this surprising
observed brightness is due to the contribution of Earthshine beneath the
orbiting satellites. We also compare our observations to existing satellite
optical brightness models and find that satellite optical brightness during the
day can only be well described by a model including an Earthshine component. We
find that observed light curves are more complex than simple geometric models
predict, but generally agree within an order of magnitude. Finally we suggest
improvements to satellite optical brightness models by incorporating weather
data to measure the actual Earthshine under a satellite.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Retrieving the phase of a complex-valued field from the measurements of its
amplitude is a crucial problem with a wide range of applications in microscopy
and ultracold atomic physics. In particular, obtaining an accurate and
efficient solution to this problem is a key step in shaping laser beams for
trapping atoms in optical tweezer arrays and applying high-fidelity entangling
gates on a neutral atom quantum computer. Current approaches to this problem
fail to converge on the optimal solution due to a phenomenon known as vortex
formation. In this work, we present an efficient optimization algorithm using
Optimal Transport. Our approach completely bypasses the creation of phase
vortices and allows for a state-of-the-art solution both in terms of accuracy
and efficiency. Furthermore, we show a deep theoretical connection between the
Optimal Transport plan and the ray-optics limit of the Wigner distribution of
the unknown complex-valued field, and show that our method can be used to
retrieve the phase-space transformation of any unknown quadratic phase system.
Finally, we reinterpret this problem in the modern quantum learning framework.
The techniques we develop provide both useful intuition and practical tools for
advancing the frontiers of phase retrieval and laser beam shaping.</p>

undertaking: They enable "what if?" scenarios, create insights and describe
relationships between the vast data that is being collected. However, the
process of integrating and subsequently using models in urban digital twins is
an inherently complex undertaking. It raises questions about how to represent
urban complexity, how to deal with uncertain assUrban Model Platformtions and
modeling paradigms, and how to capture underlying power relations. Existent
approaches in the domain largely focus on monolithic and centralized solutions
in the tradition of neoliberal city-making, oftentimes prohibiting pluralistic
and open interoperable models. Using a participatory design for participatory
systems approach together with the City of Hamburg, Germany, we find that an
open Urban Model Platform can function both as a public technological backbone
for modeling and simulation in urban digital twins and as a socio-technical
framework for a collaborative and pluralistic representation of urban
processes. Such a platform builds on open standards, allows for a decentralized
integration of models, enables communication between models and supports a
multi-model approach to representing urban systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The increasing demand for reliable, high-capacity communication during
large-scale outdoor events poses significant challenges for traditional
Terrestrial Networks (TNs), which often struggle to provide consistent coverage
in high-density environments. This paper presents a novel 6G radio network
planning framework that integrates Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) with
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) to deliver ubiquitous coverage and
enhanced network capacity. Our framework overcomes the limitations of
conventional deployable base stations by leveraging NTN architectures,
including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and passive RIS platforms seamlessly
integrated with Beyond 5G (B5G) TNs. By incorporating advanced B5G technologies
such as Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) and beamforming, and by
optimizing spectrum utilization across the C, S, and Ka bands, we implement a
rigorous interference management strategy based on a dynamic SINR model.
Comprehensive calculations and simulations validate the proposed framework,
demonstrating significant improvements in connectivity, reliability, and
cost-efficiency in crowded scenarios. This integration strategy represents a
promising solution for meeting the evolving demands of future 6G networks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper presents a scenario based robust optimization framework for short
term energy scheduling in electricity intensive industrial plants, explicitly
addressing uncertainty in planning decisions. The model is formulated as a
two-stage Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and integrates a hybrid scenario
generation method capable of representing uncertain inputs such as electricity
prices, renewable generation, and internal demand. A convex objective function
combining expected and worst case operational costs allows for tunable risk
aversion, enabling planners to balance economic performance and robustness. The
resulting schedule ensures feasibility across all scenarios and supports
coordinated use of industrial flexibility assets, including battery energy
storage and shiftable production. To isolate the effects of market volatility,
the framework is applied to a real world cement manufacturing case study
considering only day-ahead electricity price uncertainty, with all other inputs
treated deterministically. Results show improved resilience to forecast
deviations, reduced cost variability, and more consistent operations. The
proposed method offers a scalable and risk-aware approach for industrial
flexibility planning under uncertainty.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cardiac substructures are essential in thoracic radiation therapy planning to
minimize risk of radiation-induced heart disease. Deep learning (DL) offers
efficient methods to reduce contouring burden but lacks generalizability across
different modalities and overlapping structures. This work introduces and
validates a Modality-AGnostic Image Cascade (MAGIC) for comprehensive and
multi-modal cardiac substructure segmentation. MAGIC is implemented through
replicated encoding and decoding branches of an nnU-Net-based, U-shaped
backbone conserving the function of a single model. Twenty cardiac
substructures (heart, chambers, great vessels (GVs), valves, coronary arteries
(CAs), and conduction nodes) from simulation CT (Sim-CT), low-field MR-Linac,
and cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) modalities were manually delineated and used
to train (n=76), validate (n=15), and test (n=30) MAGIC. Twelve comparison
models (four segmentation subgroups across three modalities) were equivalently
trained. All methods were compared for training efficiency and against
reference contours using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and two-tailed
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (threshold, p<0.05). Average DSC scores were
0.75(0.16) for Sim-CT, 0.68(0.21) for MR-Linac, and 0.80(0.16) for CCTA. MAGIC
outperforms the comparison in 57% of cases, with limited statistical
differences. MAGIC offers an effective and accurate segmentation solution that
is lightweight and capable of segmenting multiple modalities and overlapping
structures in a single model. MAGIC further enables clinical implementation by
simplifying the computational requirements and offering unparalleled
flexibility for clinical settings.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We propose a variant of the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree Star
(RRT$^{\star}$) algorithm to synthesize trajectories satisfying a given
spatio-temporal specification expressed in a fragment of Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) for linear systems. Previous approaches for planning trajectories under
STL specifications using sampling-based methods leverage either mixed-integer
or non-smooth optimization techniques, with poor scalability in the horizon and
complexity of the task. We adopt instead a control-theoretic perspective on the
problem, based on the notion of set forward invariance. Specifically, from a
given STL task defined over polyhedral predicates, we develop a novel
algorithmic framework by which the task is efficiently encoded into a
time-varying set via linear programming, such that trajectories evolving within
the set also satisfy the task. Forward invariance properties of the resulting
set with respect to the system dynamics and input limitations are then proved
via non-smooth analysis. We then present a modified RRT$^{\star}$ algorithm to
synthesize asymptotically optimal and dynamically feasible trajectories
satisfying a given STL specification, by sampling a tree of trajectories within
the previously constructed time-varying set. We showcase two use cases of our
approach involving an autonomous inspection of the International Space Station

<p class='card-text'>Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined

<p class='card-text'>Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

<p class='card-text'>StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented

visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-12 04:29:43</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Since its inception in the mid-60s, the inventory staggering problem has been
explored and exploited in a wide range of application domains, such as
production planning, stock control systems, warehousing, and aerospace/defense
logistics. However, even with a rich history of academic focus, we are still
very much in the dark when it comes to cornerstone computational questions
around inventory staggering and to related structural characterizations, with
our methodological toolbox being severely under-stocked.
  The central contribution of this paper consists in devising a host of
algorithmic techniques and analytical ideas -- some being entirely novel and
some leveraging well-studied concepts in combinatorics and number theory -- for
surpassing essentially all known approximation guarantees for the inventory
staggering problem. In particular, our work demonstrates that numerous
structural properties open the door for designing polynomial-time approximation
schemes, including polynomially-bounded cycle lengths, constantly-many distinct
time intervals, so-called nested instances, and pairwise coprime settings.
These findings offer substantial improvements over currently available
constant-factor approximations and resolve outstanding open questions in their
respective contexts. In parallel, we develop new theory around a number of
yet-uncharted questions, related to the sampling complexity of peak inventory
estimation as well as to the plausibility of groupwise synchronization.
Interestingly, we establish the global nature of inventory staggering, proving
that there are $n$-item instances where, for every subset of roughly $\sqrt{n}$
items, no policy improves on the worst-possible one by a factor greater than
$1+\epsilon$, whereas for the entire instance, there exists a policy that
outperforms the worst-possible one by a factor of nearly $2$, which is optimal.</p>

reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance

<p class='card-text'>Less-than-truckload (LTL) shipment is vital in modern freight transportation
yet is in dire need of more efficient usage of resources, higher service
responsiveness and velocity, lower overall shipping cost across all parties,
and better quality of life for the drivers. The industry is currently highly
fragmented, with numerous small to medium-sized LTL carriers typically
operating within dedicated regions or corridors, mostly disconnected from each
other. This paper investigates the large-scale interconnection of LTL carriers
enabling each to leverage multi-carrier networks for cross-region services
exploiting their mutual logistic hubs, in line with Physical Internet
principles. In such a network, efficient open cooperation strategies are
critical for optimizing multiparty relay shipment consolidation and delivery,
transport and logistic operations and orchestration, and enabling inter-hub
driver short hauls. To dynamically plan relay truck transportation of involved
carriers across hyperconnected hub networks, we develop an optimization-based
model to build loads, coordinate shipments, and synchronize driver deliveries.
We report a simulation-based experiment in a multiparty LTL network covering
the eastern U.S. in three scenarios: 1) each carrier operates separately and
serves its clients with end-to-end transportation, 2) each carrier operates
separately and adopts relay transportation in its service region, and 3) all
carriers operate jointly and serve clients in the multi-carrier hyperconnected
relay network. By comparing these three scenarios, we evaluate the impact of
relay transportation and carrier cooperations on cost savings, trip duration,
and greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, this research advances operational
efficiencies through an effective collaborative solution across the LTL
industry and contributes to the pursuit of sustainable logistics networks.</p>
