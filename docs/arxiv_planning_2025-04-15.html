<p class='card-text'>Controllable scene generation could reduce the cost of diverse data
collection substantially for autonomous driving. Prior works formulate the
traffic layout generation as predictive progress, either by denoising entire
sequences at once or by iteratively predicting the next frame. However, full
sequence denoising hinders online reaction, while the latter's short-sighted
next-frame prediction lacks precise goal-state guidance. Further, the learned
model struggles to generate complex or challenging scenarios due to a large
number of safe and ordinal driving behaviors from open datasets. To overcome
these, we introduce Nexus, a decoupled scene generation framework that improves
reactivity and goal conditioning by simulating both ordinal and challenging
scenarios from fine-grained tokens with independent noise states. At the core
of the decoupled pipeline is the integration of a partial noise-masking
training strategy and a noise-aware schedule that ensures timely environmental
updates throughout the denoising process. To complement challenging scenario
generation, we collect a dataset consisting of complex corner cases. It covers
540 hours of simulated data, including high-risk interactions such as cut-in,
sudden braking, and collision. Nexus achieves superior generation realism while
preserving reactivity and goal orientation, with a 40% reduction in
displacement error. We further demonstrate that Nexus improves closed-loop
planning by 20% through data augmentation and showcase its capability in
safety-critical data generation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Layered control architectures have been a standard paradigm for efficiently
managing complex constrained systems. A typical architecture consists of: i) a
higher layer, where a low-frequency planner controls a simple model of the
system, and ii) a lower layer, where a high-frequency tracking controller
guides a detailed model of the system toward the output of the higher-layer
model. A fundamental problem in this layered architecture is the design of
planners and tracking controllers that guarantee both higher- and lower-layer
system constraints are satisfied. Toward addressing this problem, we introduce
a principled approach for layered multirate control of linear systems subject
to output and input constraints. Inspired by discrete-time simulation
functions, we propose a streamlined control design that guarantees the
lower-layer system tracks the output of the higher-layer system with computable
precision. Using this design, we derive conditions and present a method for
propagating the constraints of the lower-layer system to the higher-layer
system. The propagated constraints are integrated into the design of an
arbitrary planner that can handle higher-layer system constraints. Our
framework ensures that the output constraints of the lower-layer system are
satisfied at all high-level time steps, while respecting its input constraints
at all low-level time steps. We apply our approach in a scenario of motion
planning, highlighting its critical role in ensuring collision avoidance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Surgical planning for congenital heart disease traditionally relies on
collaborative group examinations of a patient's 3D-printed heart model, a
process that lacks flexibility and accessibility. While mobile augmented
reality (AR) offers a promising alternative with its portability and familiar
interaction gestures, existing solutions limit collaboration to users in the
same physical space. We developed HybridCollab, the first iOS AR application
that introduces a novel paradigm that enables both in-person and remote medical
teams to interact with a shared AR heart model in a single surgical planning
session. For example, a team of two doctors in one hospital room can
collaborate in real time with another team in a different hospital.Our approach
is the first to leverage Apple's GameKit service for surgical planning,
ensuring an identical collaborative experience for all participants, regardless
of location. Additionally, co-located users can interact with the same anchored
heart model in their shared physical space. By bridging the gap between remote

potential for significant real-world impact, streamlining communication and

<p class='card-text'>Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers superior dose conformity
with reduced exposure to surrounding healthy tissues compared to conventional
photon therapy. Improving IMPT delivery efficiency reduces motion-related
uncertainties, enhances plan robustness, and benefits breath-hold techniques by
shortening treatment time. Among various factors, energy switching time plays a
critical role, making energy layer optimization (ELO) essential. This work
develops an energy layer optimization method based on mixed integer model and
variational quantum computing algorithm to enhance the efficiency of IMPT. The
energy layer optimization problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program, where
continuous variables optimize the dose distribution and binary variables
indicate energy layer selection. To solve it, iterative convex relaxation
decouples the dose-volume constraints, followed by the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) to separate mixed-variable optimization and the
minimum monitor unit (MMU) constraint. The resulting beam intensity subproblem,
subject to MMU, either admits a closed-form solution or is efficiently solvable
via conjugate gradient. The binary subproblem is cast as a quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, solvable using variational
quantum computing algorithms. With nearly the same plan quality, the proposed
method noticeable reduces the number of the used energies. For example,
compared to conventional IMPT, QC can reduce the number of energy layers from
61 to 35 in HN case, from 56 to 35 in lung case, and from 59 to 32 to abdomen
case. The reduced number of energies also results in fewer delivery time, e.g.,
the delivery time is reduced from 100.6, 232.0, 185.3 seconds to 90.7, 215.4,
154.0 seconds, respectively.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Muons are elementary particles and provide cleaner collision events that can
explore higher energies compared to composite particles like protons. Muons are
also far heavier than their electron cousins, meaning that they emit less
synchrotron radiation that effectively limits the energies of circular
electron-positron colliders. These characteristics open up the possibility for
a Muon Collider to surpass the direct energy reach of the Large Hadron Collider
while achieving unprecedented precision measurements of Standard Model
processes. In this Essay, after briefly summarizing the progress achieved so
far, I identify important missing R&D steps and envision a compelling plan to
bring a Muon Collider to reality in the next two decades. A Muon Collider could
allow for the exploration of physics that is not available with current
technologies. For example, it may provide a way to study the Higgs boson
directly or probe new particles, including those related to dark matter or
other phenomena beyond the Standard Model.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The classical g-g diagram, representing the achievable acceleration space for
a vehicle, is commonly used as a constraint in trajectory planning and control
due to its computational simplicity. To address non-planar road geometries,
this concept can be extended to incorporate g-g constraints as a function of
vehicle speed and vertical acceleration, commonly referred to as g-g-g-v
diagrams. However, the estimation of g-g-g-v diagrams is an open problem.
Existing simulation-based approaches struggle to isolate non-transient,
open-loop stable states across all combinations of speed and acceleration,
while optimization-based methods often require simplified vehicle equations and
have potential convergence issues. In this paper, we present a novel,
open-source, quasi-steady-state black box simulation approach that applies a
virtual inertial force in the longitudinal direction. The method emulates the
load conditions associated with a specified longitudinal acceleration while
maintaining constant vehicle speed, enabling open-loop steering ramps in a
purely QSS manner. Appropriate regulation of the ramp steer rate inherently
mitigates transient vehicle dynamics when determining the maximum feasible
lateral acceleration. Moreover, treating the vehicle model as a black box
eliminates model mismatch issues, allowing the use of high-fidelity or
proprietary vehicle dynamics models typically unsuited for optimization
approaches. An open-source version of the proposed method is available at:

<p class='card-text'>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents offer cross-platform solutions for
automating complex digital tasks, with significant potential to transform
productivity workflows. However, their performance is often constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality trajectory data. To address this limitation, we
propose training Vision Language Models (VLMs) on data-rich,
reasoning-intensive tasks during a dedicated mid-training stage, and then
examine how incorporating these tasks facilitates generalization to GUI
planning scenarios. Specifically, we explore a range of tasks with readily
available instruction-tuning data, including GUI perception, multimodal
reasoning, and textual reasoning. Through extensive experiments across 11
mid-training tasks, we demonstrate that: (1) Task generalization proves highly
effective, yielding substantial improvements across most settings. For
instance, multimodal mathematical reasoning enhances performance on
AndroidWorld by an absolute 6.3%. Remarkably, text-only mathematical data
significantly boosts GUI web agent performance, achieving a 5.6% improvement on
WebArena and 5.4% improvement on AndroidWorld, underscoring notable cross-modal
generalization from text-based to visual domains; (2) Contrary to prior
assumptions, GUI perception data - previously considered closely aligned with
GUI agent tasks and widely utilized for training - has a comparatively limited
impact on final performance; (3) Building on these insights, we identify the
most effective mid-training tasks and curate optimized mixture datasets,
resulting in absolute performance gains of 8.0% on WebArena and 12.2% on
AndroidWorld. Our work provides valuable insights into cross-domain knowledge
transfer for GUI agents and offers a practical approach to addressing data

determined by climatic conditions such as rainfall. This study aims to forecast
agricultural production in Maharashtra, India, which utilises annual data from
the year 1962 to 2021. Since rainfall plays a major role with respect to the
crop yield, we analyze the impact of rainfall on crop yield using four time
series models that includes ARIMA, ARIMAX, GARCH-ARIMA and GARCH-ARIMAX. We
take advantage of rainfall as an external regressor to examine if it
contributes to the performance of the model. 1-step, 2-step, and 3-step ahead
forecasts are obtained and the model performance is assessed using MAE and
RMSE. The models are able to more accurately predict when using rainfall as a
predictor compared to when solely dependant on historical production trends
(more improved outcomes are seen in the ARIMAX and GARCH-ARIMAX models). As

<p class='card-text'>Patterns are fundamental to human cognition, enabling the recognition of

structural repeats, patterns that arise from the repetition of hierarchical
relations within sequential data, and develop a candidate computational model
of how humans detect and understand such structural repeats. Based on a
weighted deduction system, our model infers the minimal generative process of a

context-free grammar with repetition combinators. Such representation
efficiently encodes the repetition of sub-computations in a recursive manner.
As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the expressiveness of our model on short

<p class='card-text'>Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision impairment, making its
early diagnosis through fundus imaging critical for effective treatment
planning. However, the presence of poor quality fundus images caused by factors
such as inadequate illumination, noise, blurring and other motion artifacts
yields a significant challenge for accurate DR screening. In this study, we
propose progressive transfer learning for multi pass restoration to iteratively
enhance the quality of degraded fundus images, ensuring more reliable DR
screening. Unlike previous methods that often focus on a single pass
restoration, multi pass restoration via PTL can achieve a superior blind
restoration performance that can even improve most of the good quality fundus
images in the dataset. Initially, a Cycle GAN model is trained to restore low
quality images, followed by PTL induced restoration passes over the latest
restored outputs to improve overall quality in each pass. The proposed method
can learn blind restoration without requiring any paired data while surpassing
its limitations by leveraging progressive learning and fine tuning strategies
to minimize distortions and preserve critical retinal features. To evaluate
PTL's effectiveness on multi pass restoration, we conducted experiments on
DeepDRiD, a large scale fundus imaging dataset specifically curated for
diabetic retinopathy detection. Our result demonstrates state of the art
performance, showcasing PTL's potential as a superior approach to iterative

<p class='card-text'>Visual navigation, a fundamental challenge in mobile robotics, demands
versatile policies to handle diverse environments. Classical methods leverage
geometric solutions to minimize specific costs, offering adaptability to new
scenarios but are prone to system errors due to their multi-modular design and
reliance on hand-crafted rules. Learning-based methods, while achieving high
planning success rates, face difficulties in generalizing to unseen
environments beyond the training data and often require extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the
strengths of learning-based methods and classical approaches for RGB-only
visual navigation. Our method first trains a conditional diffusion model on
diverse path-RGB observation pairs. During inference, it integrates the
gradients of differentiable scene-specific and task-level costs, guiding the
diffusion model to generate valid paths that meet the constraints. This
approach alleviates the need for retraining, offering a plug-and-play solution.
Extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor settings, across simulated and

approach, achieving higher success rates and fewer collisions compared to

<p class='card-text'>Floor plans can provide valuable prior information that helps enhance the
accuracy of indoor positioning systems. However, existing research typically
faces challenges in efficiently leveraging floor plan information and applying
it to complex indoor layouts. To fully exploit information from floor plans for
positioning, we propose a floor plan-assisted fusion positioning algorithm
(FP-BP) using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR).
In the considered system, a user holding a smartphone walks through a
positioning area with BLE beacons installed on the ceiling, and can locate
himself in real time. In particular, FP-BP consists of two phases. In the
offline phase, FP-BP programmatically extracts map features from a stylized
floor plan based on their binary masks, and constructs a mapping function to
identify the corresponding map feature of any given position on the map. In the
online phase, FP-BP continuously computes BLE positions and PDR results from
BLE signals and smartphone sensors, where a novel grid-based maximum likelihood
estimation (GML) algorithm is introduced to enhance BLE positioning. Then, a
particle filter is used to fuse them and obtain an initial estimate. Finally,
FP-BP performs post-position correction to obtain the final position based on
its specific map feature. Experimental results show that FP-BP can achieve a
real-time mean positioning accuracy of 1.19 m, representing an improvement of
over 28% compared to existing floor plan-fused baseline algorithms.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We propose a novel control-theoretic framework that leverages principles from
generative modeling -- specifically, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
(DDPMs) -- to stabilize control-affine systems with nonholonomic constraints.
Unlike traditional stochastic approaches, which rely on noise-driven dynamics
in both forward and reverse processes, our method crucially eliminates the need
for noise in the reverse phase, making it particularly relevant for control
applications. We introduce two formulations: one where noise perturbs all state
dimensions during the forward phase while the control system enforces time
reversal deterministically, and another where noise is restricted to the
control channels, embedding system constraints directly into the forward
process.
  For controllable nonlinear drift-free systems, we prove that deterministic
feedback laws can exactly reverse the forward process, ensuring that the
system's probability density evolves correctly without requiring artificial
diffusion in the reverse phase. Furthermore, for linear time-invariant systems,
we establish a time-reversal result under the second formulation. By
eliminating noise in the backward process, our approach provides a more
practical alternative to machine learning-based denoising methods, which are
unsuitable for control applications due to the presence of stochasticity. We
validate our results through numerical simulations on benchmark systems,
including a unicycle model in a domain with obstacles, a driftless
five-dimensional system, and a four-dimensional linear system, demonstrating

<p class='card-text'>Freight consolidation has significant potential to reduce transportation
costs and mitigate congestion and pollution. An effective load consolidation
plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with
existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling,
personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a
significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies.
Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their
computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and
they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches
address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to
infeasible consolidation plans.
  This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits
of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML
component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the
consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained
frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective
feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive
experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT
significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on
large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning
strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic. Moreover, the ML component
provides valuable tactical-level insights by identifying frequently recurring
consolidation opportunities that guide proactive planning. In addition, SPOT is
computationally efficient and can be easily scaled to accommodate large

<p class='card-text'>The emergence of blockchain technology has revolutionized contract execution
through the introduction of smart contracts. Ethereum, the leading blockchain
platform, leverages smart contracts to power decentralized applications
(DApps), enabling transparent and self-executing systems across various
domains. While the immutability of smart contracts enhances security and trust,
it also poses significant challenges for updates, defect resolution, and
adaptation to changing requirements. Existing upgrade mechanisms are complex,
resource-intensive, and costly in terms of gas consumption, often compromising
security and limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
propose FlexiContracts+, a novel scheme that reimagines smart contracts by
enabling secure, in-place upgrades on Ethereum while preserving historical data
without relying on multiple contracts or extensive pre-deployment planning.
FlexiContracts+ enhances security, simplifies development, reduces engineering
overhead, and supports adaptable, expandable smart contracts. Comprehensive
testing demonstrates that FlexiContracts+ achieves a practical balance between
immutability and flexibility, advancing the capabilities of smart contract
systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Enabling humanoid robots to autonomously perform loco-manipulation tasks in
complex, unstructured environments poses significant challenges. This entails
equipping robots with the capability to plan actions over extended horizons
while leveraging multi-modality to bridge gaps between high-level planning and
actual task execution. Recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models
have showcased substantial potential in enhancing planning and reasoning
abilities, particularly in the comprehension and processing of semantic
information for robotic control tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel
framework based on foundation models that applies the embodied chain of action
reasoning methodology to autonomously plan actions from textual instructions
for humanoid loco-manipulation. Our method integrates humanoid-specific chain
of thought methodology, including detailed affordance and body movement
analysis, which provides a breakdown of the task into a sequence of locomotion
and manipulation actions. Moreover, we incorporate spatial reasoning based on
the observation and target object properties to effectively navigate where
target position may be unseen or occluded. Through rigorous experimental setups
on object rearrangement, manipulations and loco-manipulation tasks on a
real-world environment, we evaluate our method's efficacy on the decoupled
upper and lower body control and demonstrate the effectiveness of the chain of
robotic action reasoning strategies in comprehending human instructions.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-13 11:29:31</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Accurate and automated captioning of aerial imagery is crucial for
applications like environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster
management. However, this task remains challenging due to complex spatial
semantics and domain variability. To address these issues, we introduce
\textbf{AeroLite}, a lightweight, tag-guided captioning framework designed to
equip small-scale language models (1--3B parameters) with robust and
interpretable captioning capabilities specifically for remote sensing images.
\textbf{AeroLite} leverages GPT-4o to generate a large-scale, semantically rich
pseudo-caption dataset by integrating multiple remote sensing benchmarks,
including DLRSD, iSAID, LoveDA, WHU, and RSSCN7. To explicitly capture key
semantic elements such as orientation and land-use types, AeroLite employs
natural language processing techniques to extract relevant semantic tags. These
tags are then learned by a dedicated multi-label CLIP encoder, ensuring precise
semantic predictions. To effectively fuse visual and semantic information, we
propose a novel bridging multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture, aligning
semantic tags with visual embeddings while maintaining minimal computational
overhead. AeroLite's flexible design also enables seamless integration with
various pretrained large language models. We adopt a two-stage LoRA-based
training approach: the initial stage leverages our pseudo-caption dataset to
capture broad remote sensing semantics, followed by fine-tuning on smaller,
curated datasets like UCM and Sydney Captions to refine domain-specific
alignment. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AeroLite surpasses
significantly larger models (e.g., 13B parameters) in standard captioning
metrics, including BLEU and METEOR, while maintaining substantially lower
computational costs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Scientific diagrams are vital tools for communicating structured knowledge
across disciplines. However, they are often published as static raster images,
losing symbolic semantics and limiting reuse. While Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) offer a pathway to bridging vision and structure, existing
methods lack semantic control and structural interpretability, especially on
complex diagrams. We propose Draw with Thought (DwT), a training-free framework
that guides MLLMs to reconstruct diagrams into editable mxGraph XML code
through cognitively-grounded Chain-of-Thought reasoning. DwT enables
interpretable and controllable outputs without model fine-tuning by dividing
the task into two stages: Coarse-to-Fine Planning, which handles perceptual
structuring and semantic specification, and Structure-Aware Code Generation,
enhanced by format-guided refinement. To support evaluation, we release
Plot2XML, a benchmark of 247 real-world scientific diagrams with gold-standard
XML annotations. Extensive experiments across eight MLLMs show that our
approach yields high-fidelity, semantically aligned, and structurally valid
reconstructions, with human evaluations confirming strong alignment in both
accuracy and visual aesthetics, offering a scalable solution for converting
static visuals into executable representations and advancing machine
understanding of scientific graphics.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Robots operating in unstructured environments face significant challenges
when interacting with everyday objects like doors. They particularly struggle
to generalize across diverse door types and conditions. Existing vision-based
and open-loop planning methods often lack the robustness to handle varying door
designs, mechanisms, and push/pull configurations. In this work, we propose a
haptic-aware closed-loop hierarchical control framework that enables robots to
explore and open different unseen doors in the wild. Our approach leverages
real-time haptic feedback, allowing the robot to adjust its strategy
dynamically based on force feedback during manipulation. We test our system on
20 unseen doors across different buildings, featuring diverse appearances and
mechanical types. Our framework achieves a 90% success rate, demonstrating its
ability to generalize and robustly handle varied door-opening tasks. This
scalable solution offers potential applications in broader open-world
articulated object manipulation tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Automation of existing Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) is important but hard
to achieve. Upstream of making the GUI user-accessible or somehow scriptable,
even the data-collection to understand the original interface poses significant
challenges. For example, large quantities of general UI data seem helpful for
training general machine learning (ML) models, but accessibility for each
person can hinge on the ML's precision on a specific app. We therefore take the
perspective that a given user needs confidence, that the relevant UI elements
are being detected correctly throughout one app or digital environment. We
mostly assume that the target application is known in advance, so that data
collection and ML-training can be personalized for the test-time target domain.
The proposed Explorer system focuses on detecting on-screen buttons and
text-entry fields, i.e. interactables, where the training process has access to
a live version of the application. The live application can run on almost any
popular platform except iOS phones, and the collection is especially
streamlined for Android phones or for desktop Chrome browsers. Explorer also
enables the recording of interactive user sessions, and subsequent mapping of
how such sessions overlap and sometimes loop back to similar states. We show
how having such a map enables a kind of path planning through the GUI, letting
a user issue audio commands to get to their destination. Critically, we are
releasing our code for Explorer openly at https://github.com/varnelis/Explorer.</p>

introducing novel loss functions and training strategies into existing methods,

<p class='card-text'>Inspecting indoor environments such as tunnels, industrial facilities, and
construction sites is essential for infrastructure monitoring and maintenance.
While manual inspection in these environments is often time-consuming and
potentially hazardous, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can improve efficiency
by autonomously handling inspection tasks. Such inspection tasks usually rely
on reference maps for coverage planning. However, in industrial applications,
only the floor plans are typically available. The unforeseen obstacles not
included in the floor plans will result in outdated reference maps and
inefficient or unsafe inspection trajectories. In this work, we propose an
adaptive inspection framework that integrates global coverage planning with
local reactive adaptation to improve the coverage and efficiency of UAV-based
inspection in partially unknown indoor environments. Experimental results in
structured indoor scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach in inspection efficiency and achieving high coverage rates with
adaptive obstacle handling, highlighting its potential for enhancing the
efficiency of indoor facility inspection.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reducing undesirable path crossings among trajectories of different robots is
vital in multi-robot navigation missions, which not only reduces detours and
conflict scenarios, but also enhances navigation efficiency and boosts
productivity. Despite recent progress in multi-robot path-crossing-minimal
(MPCM) navigation, the majority of approaches depend on the minimal
squared-distance reassignment of suitable desired points to robots directly.
However, if obstacles occupy the passing space, calculating the actual
robot-point distances becomes complex or intractable, which may render the MPCM
navigation in obstacle environments inefficient or even infeasible.
  In this paper, the concurrent-allocation task execution (CATE) algorithm is
presented to address this problem (i.e., MPCM navigation in obstacle
environments). First, the path-crossing-related elements in terms of (i) robot
allocation, (ii) desired-point convergence, and (iii) collision and obstacle
avoidance are encoded into integer and control barrier function (CBF)
constraints. Then, the proposed constraints are used in an online constrained
optimization framework, which implicitly yet effectively minimizes the possible
path crossings and trajectory length in obstacle environments by minimizing the
desired point allocation cost and slack variables in CBF constraints
simultaneously. In this way, the MPCM navigation in obstacle environments can
be achieved with flexible spatial orderings. Note that the feasibility of
solutions and the asymptotic convergence property of the proposed CATE
algorithm in obstacle environments are both guaranteed, and the calculation
burden is also reduced by concurrently calculating the optimal allocation and
the control input directly without the path planning process.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-12 13:29:31</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The U.S. launched the Secure Pork Supply (SPS) Plan for Continuity of
Business, a voluntary program providing foreign animal disease (FAD) guidance
and setting biosecurity standards to maintain business continuity amid FAD
outbreaks. The role of biosecurity in disease prevention is well recognized,
yet the U.S. swine industry lacks knowledge of individual farm biosecurity
plans and the efficacy of existing measures. We describe a multi-sector
initiative that formed the Rapid Access Biosecurity (RAB) app consortium with
the swine industry, government, and academia. We (i) summarized 7,625 farms
using RABapp, (ii) mapped U.S. commercial swine coverage and areas of limited
biosecurity, and (iii) examined associations between biosecurity and
occurrences of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV).
  RABapp, used in 31 states, covers ~47% of U.S. commercial swine. Of 307
Agricultural Statistics Districts with swine, 78% (238) had <50% of those
animals in RABapp. We used a mixed-effects logistic regression model,
accounting for production company and farm type (breeding vs. non-breeding).
Requiring footwear/clothing changes, having multiple carcass disposal
locations, hosting other businesses, and greater distance to swine farms
reduced infection odds. Rendering carcasses, manure pit storage or land
application, multiple perimeter buffer areas, and a larger animal housing area
increased risk. This study leveraged RABapp to assess U.S. swine farm
biosecurity, revealing gaps in SPS plan adoption that create vulnerable
regions. Some biosecurity practices (e.g., footwear changes) lowered PRRSV/PEDV
risk, while certain disposal and manure practices increased it. Targeted
biosecurity measures and broader RABapp adoption can bolster industry
resilience against foreign animal diseases.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Plan-guided summarization attempts to reduce hallucinations in small language
models (SLMs) by grounding generated summaries to the source text, typically by
targeting fine-grained details such as dates or named entities. In this work,
we investigate whether plan-based approaches in SLMs improve summarization in
long document, narrative tasks. Narrative texts' length and complexity often
mean they are difficult to summarize faithfully. We analyze existing
plan-guided solutions targeting fine-grained details, and also propose our own
higher-level, narrative-based plan formulation. Our results show that neither
approach significantly improves on a baseline without planning in either
summary quality or faithfulness. Human evaluation reveals that while
plan-guided approaches are often well grounded to their plan, plans are equally
likely to contain hallucinations compared to summaries. As a result, the
plan-guided summaries are just as unfaithful as those from models without
planning. Our work serves as a cautionary tale to plan-guided approaches to
summarization, especially for long, complex domains such as narrative texts.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Street-view images offer unique advantages for disaster damage estimation as
they capture impacts from a visual perspective and provide detailed,
on-the-ground insights. Despite several investigations attempting to analyze
street-view images for damage estimation, they mainly focus on post-disaster
images. The potential of time-series street-view images remains underexplored.
Pre-disaster images provide valuable benchmarks for accurate damage estimations
at building and street levels. These images could aid annotators in objectively
labeling post-disaster impacts, improving the reliability of labeled data sets
for model training, and potentially enhancing the model performance in damage
evaluation. The goal of this study is to estimate hyperlocal, on-the-ground
disaster damages using bi-temporal street-view images and advanced pre-trained
vision models. Street-view images before and after 2024 Hurricane Milton in
Horseshoe Beach, Florida, were collected for experiments. The objectives are:
(1) to assess the performance gains of incorporating pre-disaster street-view
images as a no-damage category in fine-tuning pre-trained models, including
Swin Transformer and ConvNeXt, for damage level classification; (2) to design
and evaluate a dual-channel algorithm that reads pair-wise pre- and
post-disaster street-view images for hyperlocal damage assessment. The results
indicate that incorporating pre-disaster street-view images and employing a
dual-channel processing framework can significantly enhance damage assessment
accuracy. The accuracy improves from 66.14% with the Swin Transformer baseline
to 77.11% with the dual-channel Feature-Fusion ConvNeXt model. This research
enables rapid, operational damage assessments at hyperlocal spatial
resolutions, providing valuable insights to support effective decision-making
in disaster management and resilience planning.</p>

this study, we computed certain variables that reflect daily driving habits,
such as trips to specific locations (e.g., home, work, medical, social, and

were then analyzed using a two-fold approach involving data visualization and
machine learning models (C5.0, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to
investigate the efficiency of the computed variables in predicting whether a
driver is cognitively impaired or unimpaired. The C5.0 model demonstrated
robust and stable performance with a median recall of 74\%, indicating that our
methodology was able to identify cognitive impairment in drivers 74\% of the
time correctly. This highlights our model's effectiveness in minimizing false
negatives which is an important consideration given the cost of missing
