  therapy planning using geometric deep learning</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a common intervention for patients
with dyssynchronous heart failure, yet approximately one-third of recipients
fail to respond due to suboptimal lead placement. Identifying optimal pacing
sites remains challenging, largely due to patient-specific anatomical
variability and the limitations of current individualized planning strategies.
In a step towards constructing an in-silico approach to help address this
issue, we develop two geometric deep learning (DL) models, based on graph
neural network (GNN) and geometry-informed neural operator (GINO), to predict
cardiac activation time map in real-time for CRT planning and optimization.
Both models are trained on a large synthetic dataset generated from
finite-element (FE) simulations over a wide range of left ventricular (LV)
geometries, pacing site configurations, and tissue conductivities. The GINO
model significantly outperforms the GNN model, with lower prediction errors
(1.14% vs 3.14%) and superior robustness to noise and various mesh
discretization. Using the GINO model, we also develop a workflow for optimizing
the pacing site in CRT from given activation time map and LV geometry. Compared
to randomly selecting a pacing site, the CRT optimization workflow produces a
larger reduction in maximum activation time (20% vs. 8%). In conjunction with
an interactive web-based graphical user interface (GUI) available at
https://dcsim.egr.msu.edu/, the GINO model shows promising potential as a
clinical decision-support tool for personalized pre-procedural CRT
optimization.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Jonathan P. King, Harnoor Ahluwalia, Michael Zhang, Nancy S. Pollard</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-10 14:44:40</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This work presents a fast anytime algorithm for computing globally optimal
independent contact regions (ICRs). ICRs are regions such that one contact
within each region enables a valid grasp. Locations of ICRs can provide
guidance for grasp and manipulation planning, learning, and policy transfer.
However, ICRs for modern applications have been little explored, in part due to
the expense of computing them, as they have a search space exponential in the
number of contacts. We present a divide and conquer algorithm based on
incremental n-dimensional Delaunay triangulation that produces results with
bounded suboptimality in times sufficient for real-time planning. This paper
presents the base algorithm for grasps where contacts lie within a plane. Our
experiments show substantial benefits over competing grasp quality metrics and
speedups of 100X and more for competing approaches to computing ICRs. We
explore robustness of a policy guided by ICRs and outline a path to general 3D
implementation. Code will be released on publication to facilitate further
development and applications.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-10 14:40:48</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Safe and efficient navigation in crowded environments remains a critical
challenge for robots that provide a variety of service tasks such as food
delivery or autonomous wheelchair mobility. Classical robot crowd navigation
methods decouple human motion prediction from robot motion planning, which
neglects the closed-loop interactions between humans and robots. This lack of a
model for human reactions to the robot plan (e.g. moving out of the way) can
cause the robot to get stuck. Our proposed Safe and Interactive Crowd
Navigation (SICNav) method is a bilevel Model Predictive Control (MPC)
framework that combines prediction and planning into one optimization problem,
explicitly modeling interactions among agents. In this paper, we present a
systems overview of the crowd navigation platform we use to deploy SICNav in
previously unseen indoor and outdoor environments. We provide a preliminary
analysis of the system's operation over the course of nearly 7 km of autonomous
navigation over two hours in both indoor and outdoor environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by accretion disks onto supermassive
black holes in the the centers of galaxies. AGN are believed to play important
roles in the evolution of both supermassive black holes and their host galaxies
over cosmic time. AGN and the nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that interact with
them remain unresolved with present and planned telescopes. As a result, the
properties of AGN and NSCs are highly uncertain. Here we review how binary
black hole (BBH) mergers can occur in AGN disks and how both the gravitational
wave (GW) and electromagnetic wave (EM) properties of such mergers allow us to
reverse-engineer the properties of AGN disks and NSCs over cosmic time. We
point out that the feature in the BBH mass spectrum around $\sim 35M_{\odot}$
is an excellent probe of hierarchical merger models. Likewise constraints on
the spins of upper-mass gap BH ($\gtrsim 50M_{\odot}$) test the AGN channel.
The effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) distribution, including asymmetry,
islands of structure and magnitudes are excellent tests of AGN model
predictions. We also argue, that the rate of AGN-driven BBH mergers as a
function of redshift should scale slightly shallower than the AGN number
density, at least out to redshifts of $\sim 2$, and should turnover at the same
redshift as the AGN number density. Finally, we emphasize a determination of an
AGN fraction of observed BBH mergers ($f_{\rm BBH,AGN}$), \emph{regardless of
the actual value}, allows us to infer the average properties of AGN disks and
NSCs out to high redshift.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The decarbonization goals worldwide drive the energy transition of power
distribution grids, which operate under increasingly volatile conditions and
closer to their technical limits. In this context, localized operational data
with high temporal and spatial resolution is essential for their effective
planning and regulation. Nevertheless, information on grid-connected
distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles, photovoltaic systems,
and heat pumps, is often fragmented, inconsistent, and unavailable. This work
introduces a comprehensive database of distributed energy resources and
non-controllable loads allocated in Switzerland's medium- and low-voltage
distribution grid models, covering over 2 million points of connection.
Remarkably, this data specifies the flexibility capabilities of the
controllable devices, with a set of projections aligned with national forecasts
for 2030, 2040, and 2050. The database supports studies on flexibility
provision of distributed energy resources, distribution grid resilience, and
national energy policy, among other topics. Importantly, its modular structure
allows users to extract national- and local-scale information across medium-
and low-voltage systems, enabling broad applicability across locations.</p>

<p class='card-text'>While vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities
in reasoning and planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend
physical phenomena, particularly within structured 3D environments, remains
severely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhyBlock, a progressive
benchmark designed to assess VLMs on physical understanding and planning
through robotic 3D block assembly tasks. PhyBlock integrates a novel four-level
cognitive hierarchy assembly task alongside targeted Visual Question Answering
(VQA) samples, collectively aimed at evaluating progressive spatial reasoning
and fundamental physical comprehension, including object properties, spatial
relationships, and holistic scene understanding. PhyBlock includes 2600 block
tasks (400 assembly tasks, 2200 VQA tasks) and evaluates models across three
key dimensions: partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness.
We benchmark 21 state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting their strengths and
limitations in physically grounded, multi-step planning. Our empirical findings
indicate that the performance of VLMs exhibits pronounced limitations in
high-level planning and reasoning capabilities, leading to a notable decline in
performance for the growing complexity of the tasks. Error analysis reveals
persistent difficulties in spatial orientation and dependency reasoning.
Surprisingly, chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal improvements,
suggesting spatial tasks heavily rely on intuitive model comprehension. We
position PhyBlock as a unified testbed to advance embodied reasoning, bridging
vision-language understanding and real-world physical problem-solving.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Rapid advancements in RISC-V hardware development shift the focus from
low-level optimizations to higher-level parallelization. Recent RISC-V
processors, such as the SOPHON SG2042, have 64 cores. RISC-V processors with
core counts comparable to the SG2042, make efficient parallelization as crucial
for RISC-V as the more established processors such as x86-64. In this work, we
evaluate the parallel scaling of the widely used FFTW library on RISC-V for MPI
and OpenMP. We compare it to a 64-core AMD EPYC 7742 CPU side by side for
different types of FFTW planning. Additionally, we investigate the effect of
memory optimization on RISC-V in HPX-FFT, a parallel FFT library based on the
asynchronous many-task runtime HPX using an FFTW backend. We generally observe
a performance delta between the x86-64 and RISC-V chips of factor eight for
double-precision 2D FFT. Effective memory optimizations in HPX-FFT on x86-64 do
not translate to the RISC-V chip. FFTW with MPI shows good scaling up to 64
cores on x86-64 and RISC-V regardless of planning. In contrast, FFTW with
OpenMP requires measured planning on both architectures to achieve good scaling
up to 64 cores. The results of our study mark an early step on the journey to
large-scale parallel applications running on RISC-V.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This article presents a motion planning and control framework for flexible
robotic manipulators, integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a
nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) controller. Unlike conventional
approaches that focus solely on control, we demonstrate that the desired
trajectory significantly influences endpoint vibrations. To address this, a DRL
motion planner, trained using the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, generates
optimized trajectories that inherently minimize vibrations. The PDE nonlinear
controller then computes the required torques to track the planned trajectory
while ensuring closed-loop stability using Lyapunov analysis. The proposed
methodology is validated through both simulations and real-world experiments,
demonstrating superior vibration suppression and tracking accuracy compared to
traditional methods. The results underscore the potential of combining
learning-based motion planning with model-based control for enhancing the
precision and stability of flexible robotic manipulators.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-10 05:55:08</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper presents a stochastic optimization model for planning the
participation of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) in energy and
regulation markets. The proposed model quantifies and compares the business
value of single and multi-market BESS services by accounting for their bid
submission and acceptance procedures, pricing mechanisms and revenue streams,
and penalty payments and degradation costs. By modelling the price
uncertainties using market price scenarios (MPSs) and considering
representative days for different price seasonalities, the model outputs the
percentage of hours each market service can be targeted to maximize profits.
This helps in quantifying the impact of operational and market requirements of
different services on choice of markets for BESSs. It also helps in determining
the approximate costs and revenues that may be accrued by the BESS owners by
choosing combinations of available services under different price conditions.
The model thus overcomes the key limitations of previous studies that were
mainly conducted from a controller design viewpoint and were thus more focused
on the operational control of BESSs. The proposed model is generalizable and
extendable to BESS service provision in multiple markets of different regions.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-10 04:16:10</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In this work, we propose an attention-based deep reinforcement learning
approach to address the adaptive informative path planning (IPP) problem in 3D
space, where an aerial robot equipped with a downward-facing sensor must
dynamically adjust its 3D position to balance sensing footprint and accuracy,
and finally obtain a high-quality belief of an underlying field of interest
over a given domain (e.g., presence of specific plants, hazardous gas,
geological structures, etc.). In adaptive IPP tasks, the agent is tasked with
maximizing information collected under time/distance constraints, continuously
adapting its path based on newly acquired sensor data. To this end, we leverage
attention mechanisms for their strong ability to capture global spatial
dependencies across large action spaces, allowing the agent to learn an
implicit estimation of environmental transitions. Our model builds a contextual
belief representation over the entire domain, guiding sequential movement
decisions that optimize both short- and long-term search objectives.
Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art planners demonstrate that our
approach significantly reduces environmental uncertainty within constrained
budgets, thus allowing the agent to effectively balance exploration and
exploitation. We further show our model generalizes well to environments of
varying sizes, highlighting its potential for many real-world applications.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and
functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often
well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always
consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by
major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving
insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems,
benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient
and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new
APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics
for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation.
Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the
impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization.
Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML
researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel
solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for
instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced
benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth

<p class='card-text'>This paper presents a periodic bipedal gait learning method using reward
composition, integrated with a real-time gait planner for humanoid robots.
First, we introduce a novel gait planner that incorporates dynamics to design
the desired joint trajectory. In the gait design process, the 3D robot model is
decoupled into two 2D models, which are then approximated as hybrid inverted
pendulums (H-LIP) for trajectory planning. The gait planner operates in
parallel in real time within the robot's learning environment. Second, based on
this gait planner, we design three effective reward functions within a
reinforcement learning framework, forming a reward composition to achieve
periodic bipedal gait. This reward composition reduces the robot's learning
time and enhances locomotion performance. Finally, a gait design example and
performance comparison are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the

<p class='card-text'>Recent studies empirically reveal that large reasoning models (LRMs) can
automatically allocate more reasoning strengths (i.e., the number of reasoning
tokens) for harder problems, exhibiting difficulty-awareness for better task
performance. While this automatic reasoning strength allocation phenomenon has
been widely observed, its underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. To
this end, we provide explanations for this phenomenon from the perspective of
model activations. We find evidence that LRMs pre-plan the reasoning strengths
in their activations even before generation, with this reasoning strength
causally controlled by the magnitude of a pre-allocated directional vector.
Specifically, we show that the number of reasoning tokens is predictable solely
based on the question activations using linear probes, indicating that LRMs
estimate the required reasoning strength in advance. We then uncover that LRMs
encode this reasoning strength through a pre-allocated directional vector
embedded in the activations of the model, where the vector's magnitude
modulates the reasoning strength. Subtracting this vector can lead to reduced
reasoning token number and performance, while adding this vector can lead to
increased reasoning token number and even improved performance. We further
reveal that this direction vector consistently yields positive reasoning length
prediction, and it modifies the logits of end-of-reasoning token </think> to
affect the reasoning length. Finally, we demonstrate two potential applications
of our findings: overthinking behavior detection and enabling efficient
reasoning on simple problems. Our work provides new insights into the internal
mechanisms of reasoning in LRMs and offers practical tools for controlling
their reasoning behaviors. Our code is available at

<p class='card-text'>In this new era of time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, various new
transients and new phenomena are constantly being discovered thanks to the
rapid advances in observations, which provide the excellent opportunity to
study the physics in the extreme environments. The enhanced X-ray Timing and
Polarimetry mission (eXTP), planned to be launched in 2030, has several key
advantages, including advanced polarimetry, high sensitivity & large effective
area, and wide energy range coverage, which make it a groundbreaking project in
high-energy astrophysics. In this article, we briefly introduce the potential
time-domain and multi-messenger targets for eXTP, including gravitational-wave
(GW) counterparts, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), magnetars and fast radio bursts
(FRBs), tidal disruption events (TDEs), supernovae, high energy neutrinos and
TeV active galactic nucleus (AGNs), and so on. We discuss the advantages of
future eXTP observations for detecting these sources, their detection
capabilities, the abilities to distinguish theoretical models, and their
applications in gravity and cosmology.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In the architectural design process, floorplan design is often a dynamic and
iterative process. Architects progressively draw various parts of the floorplan
according to their ideas and requirements, continuously adjusting and refining
throughout the design process. Therefore, the ability to predict a complete
floorplan from a partial one holds significant value in the design process.
Such prediction can help architects quickly generate preliminary designs,
improve design efficiency, and reduce the workload associated with repeated
modifications. To address this need, we propose FloorplanMAE, a self-supervised
learning framework for restoring incomplete floor plans into complete ones.
First, we developed a floor plan reconstruction dataset, FloorplanNet,
specifically trained on architectural floor plans. Secondly, we propose a floor
plan reconstruction method based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which
reconstructs missing parts by masking sections of the floor plan and training a
lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated the reconstruction accuracy
of FloorplanMAE and compared it with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally,
we validated the model using real sketches from the early stages of
architectural design. Experimental results show that the FloorplanMAE model can
generate high-quality complete floor plans from incomplete partial plans. This
framework provides a scalable solution for floor plan generation, with broad
application prospects.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Traditional motion planning methods for robots with many degrees-of-freedom,
such as mobile manipulators, are often computationally prohibitive for
real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-model motion
planning pipeline, termed Re4MPC, which computes trajectories using Nonlinear
Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Re4MPC generates trajectories in a
computationally efficient manner by reactively selecting the model, cost, and
constraints of the NMPC problem depending on the complexity of the task and
robot state. The policy for this reactive decision-making is learned via a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. We introduce a mathematical formulation
to integrate NMPC into this DRL framework. To validate our methodology and
design choices, we evaluate DRL training and test outcomes in a physics-based
simulation involving a mobile manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate
that Re4MPC is more computationally efficient and achieves higher success rates
in reaching end-effector goals than the NMPC baseline, which computes
whole-body trajectories without our learning mechanism.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in multimodal vision-language-action (VLA) models have
revolutionized traditional robot learning, enabling systems to interpret
vision, language, and action in unified frameworks for complex task planning.
However, mastering complex manipulation tasks remains an open challenge,
constrained by limitations in persistent contextual memory, multi-agent
coordination under uncertainty, and dynamic long-horizon planning across
variable sequences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{HiBerNAC}, a
\textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{B}rain-\textbf{e}mulated \textbf{r}obotic
\textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{C}ollective, inspired by breakthroughs

specifically designed for complex robotic manipulation tasks. By leveraging
neuro-inspired functional modules with decentralized multi-agent collaboration,
our approach enables robust and enhanced real-time execution of complex

collective intelligence via dynamic agent specialization, adapting its
coordination strategy to variable task horizons and complexity. Through
extensive experiments on complex manipulation tasks compared with
state-of-the-art VLA models, we demonstrate that \textbf{HiBerNAC} reduces
average long-horizon task completion time by 23\%, and achieves non-zero
success rates (12\textendash 31\%) on multi-path tasks where prior

<p class='card-text'>We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder
autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and
planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving
dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance
improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a
strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics.
Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has
important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model
development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number
of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training
compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows,
optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset
size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that
sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive
with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models
becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results
demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties
of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their
performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly
study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to
improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address
the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including
irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic
segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large,
well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate
ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks
have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or
connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground
truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a
semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI,
DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module
processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on
the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show
that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and
training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification.
IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and
mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example,
applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Realistic urban traffic simulation is essential for sustainable urban

generating high-fidelity, time-varying traffic profiles that accurately reflect
real-world conditions, especially in large-scale scenarios, remains a major
challenge. Existing methods often suffer from limitations in accuracy,

work introduces DesRUTGe (Decentralized Realistic Urban Traffic Generator), a
novel framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents with

innovation of DesRUTGe is its use of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL),
wherein each traffic detector and its corresponding urban zone function as an
independent learning node. These nodes train local DRL models using minimal
historical data and collaboratively refine their performance by exchanging
model parameters with selected peers (e.g., geographically adjacent zones),
without requiring a central coordinator. Evaluated using real-world data from

<p class='card-text'>The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning
traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that
require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before
acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new
information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this
work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of
test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable
running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic
re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling
dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even
prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task
success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI
(Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL)
approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths.
Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data
web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI
enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results
establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling

incorporates a novel detection approach that improves upon traditional object

CrosswalkNet has also been successfully applied to datasets from New Hampshire,

<p class='card-text'>This paper addresses the problem of underwater acoustic source tracking and
pursuit with a team of autonomous underwater vehicles. Producing distributed
control strategies in an underwater sensor network is not trivial since
communication is primarily acoustic, which makes it intermittent and often
plagued with major difficulties. For this reason, we propose an optimization
scheme based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process for improving
the performance of underwater mobile sensor networks, in which autonomous
underwater vehicles (agents) play the role of moving nodes of a network. The
key idea is to adjust the agents' guidance strategies to achieve coordinated
motion planning, enabling optimal geometric configurations between the agents
and the target to enhance tracking performance. Such a problem is cast as a
multi-objective optimization problem that is solved through a receding horizon
lookahead optimization scheme since we are interested in long-term tracking
accuracy. The planning strategy is distributed using the sequential multi-agent
decision-making paradigm to make the solving tractable since the optimization
depends on the joint action domain. A distributed control framework has been
implemented in a simulation environment to validate the proposed approach,
which explicitly accounts for the major limitations imposed by acoustic

<p class='card-text'>Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery
is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning
but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods
either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via
patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they
suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during
training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR
images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The
high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the
low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches
capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module
integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency
Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and
Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to
stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net
achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39,
