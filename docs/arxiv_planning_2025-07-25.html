<p class='card-text'>We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for
decision-making in partially observable environments, which can be modeled as
Markov decision processes and compactly represented through dynamic decision
Bayesian networks. Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse
Bayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined
with amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating
acceptance probabilities.\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum
Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead
algorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a
rigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions
for the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box
oracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to
more accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for
environments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based
near-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through
quantum-enhanced belief updates.
  Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its
classical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our
results offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage
translates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of
the advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In recent years, Compressed Sensing (CS) has gained significant interest as a
technique for acquiring high-resolution sensory data using fewer measurements
than traditional Nyquist sampling requires. At the same time, autonomous
robotic platforms such as drones and rovers have become increasingly popular
tools for remote sensing and environmental monitoring tasks, including
measurements of temperature, humidity, and air quality. Within this context,
this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation into
how the structure of CS measurement matrices can be exploited to design
optimized sampling trajectories for robotic environmental data collection. We
propose a novel Monte Carlo optimization framework that generates measurement
matrices designed to minimize both the robot's traversal path length and the
signal reconstruction error within the CS framework. Central to our approach is
the application of Dictionary Learning (DL) to obtain a data-driven sparsifying
transform, which enhances reconstruction accuracy while further reducing the
number of samples that the robot needs to collect. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through experiments reconstructing $NO_2$ pollution
maps over the Gulf region. The results indicate that our approach can reduce
robot travel distance to less than $10\%$ of a full-coverage path, while
improving reconstruction accuracy by over a factor of five compared to
traditional CS methods based on DCT and polynomial dictionaries, as well as by
a factor of two compared to previously-proposed Informative Path Planning (IPP)

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-24 13:17:47</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This study proposes and evaluates the PAnoramic Learning Map (PALM), a
learning analytics (LA) dashboard designed to address the scalability
challenges of LA by integrating curriculum-level information. Traditional LA
research has predominantly focused on individual courses or learners and often
lacks a framework that considers the relationships between courses and the
long-term trajectory of learning. To bridge this gap, PALM was developed to
integrate multilayered educational data into a curriculum map, enabling
learners to intuitively understand their learning records and academic
progression. We conducted a system evaluation to assess PALM's effectiveness in
two key areas: (1) its impact on students' awareness of their learning
behaviors, and (2) its comparative performance against existing systems. The
results indicate that PALM enhances learners' awareness of study planning and
reflection, particularly by improving perceived behavioral control through the
visual presentation of individual learning histories and statistical trends,
which clarify the links between learning actions and outcomes. Although PALM
requires ongoing refinement as a system, it received significantly higher
evaluations than existing systems in terms of visual appeal and usability. By
serving as an information resource with previously inaccessible insights, PALM
enhances self-regulated learning and engagement, representing a significant
step beyond conventional LA toward a comprehensive and scalable approach.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Tritium is a well-known byproduct of particle accelerator operations. To keep
levels of tritium below regulatory limits, tritium production is actively
monitored and managed at Fermilab. We plan to study tritium production in the
targets, beamline components, and shielding elements of the Fermilab facilities
such as NuMI, BNB, and MI-65. To facilitate the analysis, we construct a simple
model and use three Monte Carlo radiation codes, FLUKA, MARS, and PHITS, to
estimate the amount of tritium produced in these facilities. The analysis could
also serve as an intercomparison between these code results related to tritium
production. To assess the actual amounts of tritium that would be released from
various materials, we employ a semi-empirical diffusion model. The results of
this analysis are compared to experimental data whenever possible. This
approach also helps to optimize proposed target materials with respect to the
tritium production and release.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are
encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive
behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical
lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse
manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability
and generalization. Code and videos at https://resem3d.github.io.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In this paper, we present a subsystem, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV),
for search and rescue missions, focusing on people detection, face recognition
and tracking of identified individuals. The proposed solution integrates a UAV
with ROS2 framework, that utilizes multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for search missions. System identification and PD controller deployment are
performed for autonomous UAV navigation. The ROS2 environment utilizes the
YOLOv11 and YOLOv11-pose CNNs for tracking purposes, and the dlib library CNN
for face recognition. The system detects a specific individual, performs face
recognition and starts tracking. If the individual is not yet known, the UAV
operator can manually locate the person, save their facial image and
immediately initiate the tracking process. The tracking process relies on
specific keypoints identified on the human body using the YOLOv11-pose CNN
model. These keypoints are used to track a specific individual and maintain a
safe distance. To enhance accurate tracking, system identification is
performed, based on measurement data from the UAVs IMU. The identified system
parameters are used to design PD controllers that utilize YOLOv11-pose to
estimate the distance between the UAVs camera and the identified individual.
The initial experiments, conducted on 14 known individuals, demonstrated that
the proposed subsystem can be successfully used in real time. The next step
involves implementing the system on a large experimental UAV for field use and

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-24 05:28:52</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Large renewable penetration has been witnessed in power systems, resulting in
reduced levels of system inertia and increasing requirements for frequency
response services. There have been plenty of studies developing
frequency-constrained models for power system security. However, most existing
literature only considers uniform frequency security, while neglecting
frequency spatial differences in different regions. To fill this gap, this
paper proposes a novel planning model for the optimal sizing problem of power
systems, capturing regional frequency security and inter-area frequency
oscillations. Specifically, regional frequency constraints are first extracted
via an enhanced input convex neural network (ICNN) and then embedded into the
original optimisation for frequency security, where a principled weight
initialisation strategy is adopted to deal with the gradient vanishing issues
of non-negative weights in traditional ICNNs and enhance its fitting ability.
An adaptive genetic algorithm with sparsity calculation and local search is
developed to separate the planning model into two stages and effectively solve
it iteratively. Case studies have been conducted on three different power
systems to verify the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-constrained
planning model in ensuring regional system security and obtaining realistic
investment decisions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Power systems decarbonization are at the focal point of the clean energy
transition. While system operators and utility companies increasingly publicize
system-level carbon emission information, it remains unclear how emissions from
individual generators are transported through the grid and how they impact
electricity users at specific locations. This paper presents a novel and
computationally efficient approach for exact quantification of nodal average
and marginal carbon emission rates, applicable to both AC and DC optimal power
flow problems. The approach leverages graph-based topological sorting and
directed cycle removal techniques, applied to directed graphs formed by
generation dispatch and optimal power flow solutions. Our proposed algorithm
efficiently identifies each generator's contribution to each node, capturing
how emissions are spatially distributed under varying system conditions. To
validate its effectiveness and reveal locational and temporal emission patterns
in the real world, we simulate the 8,870-bus realistic California grid using
actual CAISO data and the CATS model. Based on year long hourly data on nodal
loads and renewable generation, obtained or estimated from CAISO public data,
our method accurately estimates power flow conditions, generation mixes, and
systemwide emissions, and delivers fine grained spatiotemporal emission

<p class='card-text'>This research full paper investigates the factors influencing computing
educators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) in software engineering
and computing curricula. Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach,
PjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical
thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits,
faculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient
institutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities,
designing or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This
research explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources
that facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data
from 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising
closed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs,
along with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative
data were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses
underwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued,
its adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and
managing the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of
institutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty
are more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer
collaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives. In
addition, sourcing projects from research, industry partnerships, and borrowing
from peers emerged as key facilitators for new projects. These findings
underscore the need for systemic support structures to empower faculty to
experiment with and scale PjBL practices.</p>

to realize energy efficient applications. Here we use a combination of
accelerator-based fast ion implantation and theory-driven planning to enhance
the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR)--a signature of a chiral

commonly used to investigate semiconductors and nuclear materials but is rarely

thin films display a maximum NLMR over $B = 9$ T--all while maintaining

ensure safe operation can lead to physical damage to the system, environmental
pollution, and even loss of human life. Recent work has demonstrated that
motion planning techniques effectively generate a collision-free trajectory
during navigation. However, these methods, while creating the motion plans, do
not inherently consider the safe operational region of the system, leading to
potential safety constraints violation during deployment. In this paper, we
propose a method that leverages run time safety assurance in a kinodynamic
motion planning scheme to satisfy the system's operational constraints. First,
we use a sampling-based geometric planner to determine a high-level
collision-free path within a user-defined space. Second, we design a low-level
safety assurance filter to provide safety guarantees to the control input of a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) designed with the purpose of trajectory
tracking. We demonstrate our proposed approach in a restricted 3D simulation
environment using a model of the Crazyflie 2.0 drone.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Medium and heavy-duty (MHD) commercial vehicles contribute significantly to
carbon emissions, accounting for 21\% of the total emissions in the
transportation sector. To curb this, U.S. government is increasingly focusing
on achieving 100\% fleet electrification over the next decade. However, the
integration of megawatt-scale charging stations designed for MHD vehicles poses
challenges to the stability of secondary distribution systems. This study
investigates the impact of megawatt-scale charging station loads on a benchmark
IEEE 33-bus distribution system using real data from the HEVI-LOAD software for
MHD electrification planning developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
(LBNL). The results reveal significant violations of per-unit (p.u.) voltage
values at various nodes of the distribution system, indicating that substantial
upgrades to the distribution infrastructure will be necessary to accommodate
the projected MHDEV charging loads and meet electrification targets.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-23 15:28:23</h6>
<p class='card-text'>While end-to-end autonomous driving models show promising results, their
practical deployment is often hindered by large model sizes, a reliance on
expensive LiDAR sensors and computationally intensive BEV feature
representations. This limits their scalability, especially for mass-market
vehicles equipped only with cameras. To address these challenges, we propose
PRIX (Plan from Raw Pixels). Our novel and efficient end-to-end driving
architecture operates using only camera data, without explicit BEV
representation and forgoing the need for LiDAR. PRIX leverages a visual feature
extractor coupled with a generative planning head to predict safe trajectories
from raw pixel inputs directly. A core component of our architecture is the
Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT), a novel module designed to
effectively enhance multi-level visual features for more robust planning. We
demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that PRIX achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching
the capabilities of larger, multimodal diffusion planners while being
significantly more efficient in terms of inference speed and model size, making
it a practical solution for real-world deployment. Our work is open-source and

  Stations Considering Flexible Capacity Strategy</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Zhe Yu, Xue Hu, Qin Wang</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-23 15:22:04</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has significantly
increased demand on both transportation and power systems, posing challenges to
their stable operation. To support the growing need for EV charging, both fixed
charging stations (FCSs) and mobile charging stations (MCSs) have been
introduced, serving as key interfaces between the power grid and traffic
network. Recognizing the importance of collaborative planning across these
sectors, this paper presents a two-stage joint planning model for FCSs and
MCSs, utilizing an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. The primary goal of the proposed model is to transform the potential
negative impacts of large-scale EV integration into positive outcomes, thereby
enhancing social welfare through collaboration among multiple stakeholders. In
the first stage, we develop a framework for evaluating FCS locations,
incorporating assessments of EV hosting capacity and voltage stability. The
second stage introduces a joint planning model for FCSs and MCSs, aiming to
minimize the overall social costs of the EV charging system while maintaining a
reliable power supply. To solve the planning problem, we employ a combination
of mixed-integer linear programming, queueing theory, and sequential quadratic
programming. The improved ADMM algorithm couples the siting and sizing
decisions consistently by introducing coupling constraints, and supports a
distributed optimization framework that coordinates the interests of EV users,
MCS operators, and distribution system operators. Additionally, a flexible
capacity planning strategy that accounts for the multi-period development
potential of EVCS is proposed to reduce both the complexity and the investment
required for FCS construction. Finally, a case study with comparative
experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed models and solution
methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-UAV Coverage Path Planning (mCPP) algorithms in popular commercial
software typically treat a Region of Interest (RoI) only as a 2D plane,
ignoring important3D structure characteristics. This leads to incomplete
3Dreconstructions, especially around occluded or vertical surfaces. In this
paper, we propose a modular algorithm that can extend commercial
two-dimensional path planners to facilitate terrain-aware planning by adjusting
altitude and camera orientations. To demonstrate it, we extend the well-known
DARP (Divide Areas for Optimal Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning) algorithm
and produce DARP-3D. We present simulation results in multiple 3D environments
and a real-world flight test using DJI hardware. Compared to baseline, our
approach consistently captures improved 3D reconstructions, particularly in
areas with significant vertical features. An open-source implementation of the

<p class='card-text'>This correspondence presents a power-aware cognitive radar framework for
joint detection and tracking of multiple targets in a massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) radar environment. Building on a previous single-target
algorithm based on Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP), we extend
it to the multi-target case by assigning each target an independent POMCP tree,
enabling scalable and efficient planning.
  Departing from uniform power allocation-which is often suboptimal with
varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)-our approach predicts each target's
future angular position and expected received power, based on its estimated
range and radar cross-section (RCS). These predictions guide adaptive waveform
design via a constrained optimization problem that allocates transmit energy to
enhance the detectability of weaker or distant targets, while ensuring
sufficient power for high-SNR targets. The reward function in the underlying
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is also modified to
prioritize accurate spatial and power estimation.
  Simulations involving multiple targets with different SNRs confirm the
effectiveness of our method. The proposed framework for the cognitive radar
improves detection probability for low-SNR targets and achieves more accurate
tracking compared to approaches using uniform or orthogonal waveforms. These
results demonstrate the potential of the POMCP-based framework for adaptive,
efficient multi-target radar systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Detecting diverse objects within complex indoor 3D point clouds presents
significant challenges for robotic perception, particularly with varied object
shapes, clutter, and the co-existence of static and dynamic elements where
traditional bounding box methods falter. To address these limitations, we
propose IndoorBEV, a novel mask-based Bird's-Eye View (BEV) method for indoor
mobile robots.
  In a BEV method, a 3D scene is projected into a 2D BEV grid which handles
naturally occlusions and provides a consistent top-down view aiding to
distinguish static obstacles from dynamic agents. The obtained 2D BEV results
is directly usable to downstream robotic tasks like navigation, motion
prediction, and planning. Our architecture utilizes an axis compact encoder and
a window-based backbone to extract rich spatial features from this BEV map. A
query-based decoder head then employs learned object queries to concurrently
predict object classes and instance masks in the BEV space. This mask-centric
formulation effectively captures the footprint of both static and dynamic
objects regardless of their shape, offering a robust alternative to bounding
box regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndoorBEV on a custom
indoor dataset featuring diverse object classes including static objects

<p class='card-text'>The mixed-model assembly line (MMAL) is a production system used in the
automobile industry to manufacture different car models on the same conveyor,
offering a high degree of product customization and flexibility. However, the
MMAL also poses challenges, such as finding optimal sequences of models
satisfying multiple constraints and objectives related to production
performance, quality, and delivery -- including minimizing the number of color
changeovers in the Paint Shop, balancing the workload and setup times on the

Habitable Worlds Observatory is planned to receive over $10 billion over the
next two decades whereas extraterrestrial intelligence research receives nearly
zero federal funding. This imbalance is in contrast to both scientific value
and public interest, as 65% of Americans and 58.2% of surveyed astrobiologists
believe extraterrestrial intelligence exists. Empirical psychological research
demonstrates that humanity possesses greater resilience toward extraterrestrial
contact than historically recognized. Contemporary studies reveal adaptive
responses rather than mass panic, conflicting with the rationale for excluding
extraterrestrial intelligence research from federal funding since 1993. The
response to the recent interstellar object 3I/ATLAS exemplifies consequences of
this underinvestment: despite discovery forecasts of a new interstellar object
every few months for the coming decade, no funded missions exist to intercept

establishing a comprehensive research program to explore both biosignatures and
technosignatures on interstellar objects. This program would address profound

<p class='card-text'>Motion forecasting and planning are tasked with estimating the trajectories
of traffic agents and the ego vehicle, respectively, to ensure the safety and
efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments.
State-of-the-art methods typically adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm,
where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-mode
trajectories. While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it
often falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of
trajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome
this limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion
estimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture
the diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to
track the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a
self-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory
interaction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent
scenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of
motion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To
effectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining
Attention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both
mechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory
state sequence modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMo++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including motion
forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and
end-to-end planning (NAVSIM).</p>

Incorporating tactile feedback into these systems is challenging due to the

<p class='card-text'>Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a pivotal solution to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions paving a pathway to net zero. As the adoption of EVs
continues to grow, countries are proactively formulating systematic plans for
nationwide electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI) to keep pace with
the accelerating shift towards EVs. This comprehensive review aims to
thoroughly examine current global practices in EVCI planning and explore
state-of-the-art methodologies for designing EVCI planning strategies. Despite
remarkable efforts by influential players in the global EV market, such as
China, the United States, and the European Union, the progress in EVCI rollout
has been notably slower than anticipated in the rest of the world. This delay
can be attributable to three major impediments: inadequate EVCI charging
services, low utilization rates of public EVCI facilities, and the non-trivial
integration of EVCI into the electric grid. This review dissects the interests
of these stakeholders, clarifying their respective roles and expectations in
the context of EVCI planning. This review also provides insights into level 1,
2, and 3 chargers with explorations of their applications in different
geographical locations for diverse EV charging patterns. Finally, a thorough
review of node-based and flow-based approaches to EV planning is presented. The
modeling of placing charging stations is broadly categorized into set coverage,
maximum coverage, flow-capturing, and flow-refueling location models. In
conclusion, this review identifies several research gaps, including the dynamic
modeling of EV charging demand and the coordination of vehicle electrification
with grid decarbonization. This paper calls for further contributions to bridge
these gaps and drive the advancement of EVCI planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This experience report analyses a one year project focused on building a
distributed real-time analytics system using edge computing and machine
learning. The project faced critical setbacks due to a big-bang integration
approach, where all components developed by multiple geographically dispersed
partners were merged at the final stage. The integration effort resulted in
only six minutes of system functionality, far below the expected 40 minutes.
Through root cause analysis, the study identifies technical and organisational
barriers, including poor communication, lack of early integration testing, and
resistance to topdown planning. It also considers psychological factors such as
a bias toward fully developed components over mockups. The paper advocates for
early mock based deployment, robust communication infrastructures, and the
adoption of topdown thinking to manage complexity and reduce risk in reactive,
distributed projects. These findings underscore the limitations of traditional
Agile methods in such contexts and propose simulation-driven engineering and
structured integration cycles as key enablers for future success.</p>
