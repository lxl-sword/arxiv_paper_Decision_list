<p class='card-text'>How can we rely on an end-to-end autonomous vehicle's complex decision-making
system during deployment? One common solution is to have a ``fallback layer''
that checks the planned trajectory for rule violations and replaces it with a
pre-defined safe action if necessary. Another approach involves adjusting the
planner's decisions to minimize a pre-defined ``cost function'' using
additional system predictions such as road layouts and detected obstacles.
However, these pre-programmed rules or cost functions cannot learn and improve
with new training data, often resulting in overly conservative behaviors. In
this work, we propose Centaur (Cluster Entropy for Test-time trAining using
Uncertainty) which updates a planner's behavior via test-time training, without
relying on hand-engineered rules or cost functions. Instead, we measure and
minimize the uncertainty in the planner's decisions. For this, we develop a
novel uncertainty measure, called Cluster Entropy, which is simple,
interpretable, and compatible with state-of-the-art planning algorithms. Using
data collected at prior test-time time-steps, we perform an update to the
model's parameters using a gradient that minimizes the Cluster Entropy. With
only this sole gradient update prior to inference, Centaur exhibits significant
improvements, ranking first on the navtest leaderboard with notable gains in
safety-critical metrics such as time to collision. To provide detailed insights
on a per-scenario basis, we also introduce navsafe, a challenging new
benchmark, which highlights previously undiscovered failure modes of driving
models.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In the present paper we develop a distributed method to reconnect a
multi-robot team after connectivity failures, caused by unpredictable
environment changes, i.e. appearance of new obstacles. After the changes, the
team is divided into different groups of robots. The groups have a limited
communication range and only a partial information in their field of view about
the current scenario. Their objective is to form a chain from a static base
station to a goal location. In the proposed distributed replanning approach,
the robots predict new plans for the other groups from the new observed
information by each robot in the changed scenario, to restore the connectivity
with a base station and reach the initial joint objective. If a solution
exists, the method achieves the reconnection of all the groups in a unique
chain. The proposed method is compared with other two cases: 1) when all the
agents have full information of the environment, and 2) when some robots must
move to reach other waiting robots for reconnection. Numerical simulations are
provided to evaluate the proposed approach in the presence of unpredictable
scenario changes.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In this paper we develop a method for planning and coordinating a multi-agent

the best balance between workers and collectors, and with whom the workers must

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-14 14:47:58</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Navigating unknown three-dimensional (3D) rugged environments is challenging
for multi-robot systems. Traditional discrete systems struggle with rough
terrain due to limited individual mobility, while modular systems--where rigid,
controllable constraints link robot units--improve traversal but suffer from
high control complexity and reduced flexibility. To address these limitations,
we propose the Multi-Robot System with Controllable Weak Constraints (MRS-CWC),
where robot units are connected by constraints with dynamically adjustable
stiffness. This adaptive mechanism softens or stiffens in real-time during
environmental interactions, ensuring a balance between flexibility and
mobility. We formulate the system's dynamics and control model and evaluate
MRS-CWC against six baseline methods and an ablation variant in a benchmark
dataset with 100 different simulation terrains. Results show that MRS-CWC
achieves the highest navigation completion rate and ranks second in success
rate, efficiency, and energy cost in the highly rugged terrain group,
outperforming all baseline methods without relying on environmental modeling,
path planning, or complex control. Even where MRS-CWC ranks second, its
performance is only slightly behind a more complex ablation variant with
environmental modeling and path planning. Finally, we develop a physical
prototype and validate its feasibility in a constructed rugged environment. For

<p class='card-text'>As the Metaverse envisions deeply immersive and pervasive connectivity in 6G
networks, Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) emerges as a critical enabler to
meet the demanding requirements of massive and immersive communications. IAB
networks offer a scalable solution for expanding broadband coverage in urban
environments. However, optimizing IAB node deployment to ensure reliable
coverage while minimizing costs remains challenging due to location constraints
and the dynamic nature of cities. Existing heuristic methods, such as Greedy
Algorithms, have been employed to address these optimization problems. This
work presents a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning ( DRL) approach for IAB
network planning, tailored to future 6G scenarios that seek to support
ultra-high data rates and dense device connectivity required by immersive
Metaverse applications. We utilize Deep Q-Network (DQN) with action elimination
and integrate DQN, Double Deep Q-Network ( DDQN), and Dueling DQN architectures
to effectively manage large state and action spaces. Simulations with various
initial donor configurations demonstrate the effectiveness of our DRL approach,
with Dueling DQN reducing node count by an average of 12.3% compared to
traditional heuristics. The study underscores how advanced DRL techniques can
address complex network planning challenges in 6G-enabled Metaverse contexts,
providing an efficient and adaptive solution for IAB deployment in diverse

<p class='card-text'>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold the potential to enhance
autonomous driving by combining domain-independent world knowledge with
context-specific language guidance. Their integration into autonomous driving
systems shows promising results in isolated proof-of-concept applications,
while their performance is evaluated on selective singular aspects of
perception, reasoning, or planning. To leverage their full potential a
systematic framework for evaluating MLLMs in the context of autonomous driving
is required. This paper proposes a holistic framework for a capability-driven
evaluation of MLLMs in autonomous driving. The framework structures scenario
understanding along the four core capability dimensions semantic, spatial,
temporal, and physical. They are derived from the general requirements of
autonomous driving systems, human driver cognition, and language-based
reasoning. It further organises the domain into context layers, processing
modalities, and downstream tasks such as language-based interaction and
decision-making. To illustrate the framework's applicability, two exemplary
traffic scenarios are analysed, grounding the proposed dimensions in realistic
driving situations. The framework provides a foundation for the structured
evaluation of MLLMs' potential for scenario understanding in autonomous
driving.</p>

factors. A mixed-method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative
methodologies, was employed. A web-based survey (n=50) utilizing a five-point
Likert scale was conducted among residents of Manhattan, New York, and Capitol

land use diversification, and enhanced infrastructure dynamics. Additionally,
residents demonstrated preferences for smart cities based on efficient urban

<p class='card-text'>Accurate and robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is crucial
for autonomous mobile systems, typically achieved by leveraging the geometric
features of the environment. Incorporating semantics provides a richer scene
representation that not only enhances localization accuracy in SLAM but also
enables advanced cognitive functionalities for downstream navigation and
planning tasks. Existing point-wise semantic LiDAR SLAM methods often suffer
from poor efficiency and generalization, making them less robust in diverse
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a semantic graph-enhanced SLAM
framework, named SG-SLAM, which effectively leverages the geometric, semantic,
and topological characteristics inherent in environmental structures. The
semantic graph serves as a fundamental component that facilitates critical
functionalities of SLAM, including robust relocalization during odometry
failures, accurate loop closing, and semantic graph map construction. Our
method employs a dual-threaded architecture, with one thread dedicated to
online odometry and relocalization, while the other handles loop closure, pose
graph optimization, and map update. This design enables our method to operate
in real time and generate globally consistent semantic graph maps and point
cloud maps. We extensively evaluate our method across the KITTI, MulRAN, and
Apollo datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Our method has been released at

impact of fluid flow on their movement. First, the proposed method employs a
Physics-Informed U-Net (PI-UNet) to refine the numerically predicted fluid

in a flow-aware A* path planning algorithm, ensuring efficient navigation while
mitigating flow-induced disturbances. Finally, a control scheme is developed to

<p class='card-text'>Motion planning and trajectory generation are crucial technologies in various
domains including the control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), manipulators,
and rockets. However, optimization-based real-time motion planning becomes
increasingly challenging due to the problem's probable non-convexity and the
inherent limitations of Non-Linear Programming algorithms. Highly nonlinear
dynamics, obstacle avoidance constraints, and non-convex inputs can exacerbate
these difficulties. To address these hurdles, this paper proposes a two-layer
optimization algorithm for 2D vehicles by dynamically reformulating small time
horizon convex programming subproblems, aiming to provide real-time guarantees
for trajectory optimization. Our approach involves breaking down the original
problem into small horizon-based planning cycles with fixed final times,
referred to as planning cycles. Each planning cycle is then solved within a
series of restricted convex sets identified by our customized search algorithms
incrementally. The key benefits of our proposed algorithm include fast
computation speeds and lower task time. We demonstrate these advantages through

<p class='card-text'>Object reorientation is a critical task for robotic grippers, especially when
manipulating objects within constrained environments. The task poses
significant challenges for motion planning due to the high-dimensional output
actions with the complex input information, including unknown object properties
and nonlinear contact forces. Traditional approaches simplify the problem by
reducing degrees of freedom, limiting contact forms, or acquiring
environment/object information in advance, which significantly compromises
adaptability. To address these challenges, we deconstruct the complex output
actions into three fundamental types based on tactile sensing: task-oriented
actions, constraint-oriented actions, and coordinating actions. These actions
are then optimized online using gradient optimization to enhance adaptability.
Key contributions include simplifying contact state perception, decomposing
complex gripper actions, and enabling online action optimization for handling
unknown objects or environmental constraints. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method is effective across a range of everyday objects,
regardless of environmental contact. Additionally, the method exhibits robust

<p class='card-text'>Vision and Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to navigate through
environments following natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often struggle with effectively integrating visual observations and instruction
details during navigation, leading to suboptimal path planning and limited
success rates. In this paper, we propose OIKG (Observation-graph Interaction

through two key components: (1) an observation-graph interaction module that
decouples angular and visual information while strengthening edge
representations in the navigation space, and (2) a key-detail guidance module
that dynamically extracts and utilizes fine-grained location and object
information from instructions. By enabling more precise cross-modal alignment
and dynamic instruction interpretation, our approach significantly improves the
agent's ability to follow complex navigation instructions. Extensive
experiments on the R2R and RxR datasets demonstrate that OIKG achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the

associating a reference frame (called motion transfer frames) on the
manipulated object and the target, selected based on their geometries and the
task at hand. By tracking and transferring the path of the motion transfer
frames, we generate motion plans for arbitrary task instances with objects of
different geometries and poses. We show results from simulation as well as
robot experiments on physical objects to evaluate the effectiveness of our

<p class='card-text'>Traditional microgrid planning often overlooks PV and BESS degradation or
relies on complex, downscaled models, leading to unreliable, costly and
suboptimal investment decisions. This paper presents a degradation-based
investment optimization (DBIO) methodology for long-term microgrid planning.
The model optimally sizes and schedules PV, BESS, and controllable distributed
energy resources, while considering technical, financial, and degradation
characteristics. We first developed a cumulative multi-year optimization model
as a benchmark, excluding BESS efficiency fade and capacity degradation that
would be captured in the next step, to ensure convergence. Subsequently, a
yearly validation model was iteratively solved for each year in the planning
horizon, updating energy efficiencies of PV and BESS, along with BESS capacity,
based on annual degradation, ensuring the reliability of initial solution. An
iterative refinement process further adjusts BESS capacity to eliminate load
shedding while minimizing costs. Sensitivity analyses on PV efficiency
degradation rates, second-life battery (SLB) capital cost, and grid tariffs
further explore their economic implications. Results show that degradation
significantly impacts resource allocation, with ignored degradation risking
reliability, potential load shedding, and blackout costs, while SLBs provide
cost-saving opportunities. The DBIO framework offers a computationally
efficient and scalable solution for microgrid planning, with broader
applications in grid-scale asset management.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper addresses the problem of optimizing communicated information among
heterogeneous, resource-aware robot teams to facilitate their navigation. In
such operations, a mobile robot compresses its local map to assist another
robot in reaching a target within an uncharted environment. The primary
challenge lies in ensuring that the map compression step balances network load
while transmitting only the most essential information for effective
navigation. We propose a communication framework that sequentially selects the
optimal map compression in a task-driven, communication-aware manner. It
introduces a decoder capable of iterative map estimation, handling noise
through Kalman filter techniques. The computational speed of our decoder allows
for a larger compression template set compared to previous methods, and enables
applications in more challenging environments. Specifically, our simulations
demonstrate a remarkable 98% reduction in communicated information, compared to
a framework that transmits the raw data, on a large Mars inclination map and an
Earth map, all while maintaining similar planning costs. Furthermore, our
method significantly reduces computational time compared to the
state-of-the-art approach.</p>

<p class='card-text'>There exist several techniques for representing the chess board inside the
computer. In the first part of this paper, the concepts of the
bitboard-representation and the advantages of (rotated) bitboards in move
generation are explained. In order to illustrate those ideas practice, the
concrete implementation of the move-generator in FUSc# is discussed and we
explain a technique how to verify the move-generator with the "perft"-command.
We show that the move-generator of FUSc# works 100% correct.
  The second part of this paper deals with reinforcement learning in computer
chess (and beyond). We exemplify the progress that has been made in this field
in the last 15-20 years by comparing the "state of the art" from 2002-2008,
when FUSc# was developed, with recent innovations connected to "AlphaZero". We
discuss how a "FUSc#-Zero" could be implemented and what would be necessary to
reduce the number of training games necessary to achieve a good performance.
This can be seen as a test case to the general prblem of improving "sample
effciency" in reinforcement learning.
  In the final part, we move beyond computer chess, as the importance of sample
effciency extends far beyond board games into a wide range of applications
where data is costly, diffcult to obtain, or time consuming to generate. We
review some application of the ideas developed in AlphaZero in other domains,
i.e. the "other Alphas" like AlphaFold, AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry and
AlphaProof. We also discuss future research and the potential for such methods
for ecological economic planning.</p>

confidence elicitation in open-ended multimodal environments. We introduce
Elicitation Policies, which structure confidence assessment across inductive,

enhance confidence calibration through scenario reinterpretation, action

<p class='card-text'>While large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, certain challenges
require complex multi-step reasoning to reach accurate answers. One
particularly challenging task is autonomous driving, which demands thorough
cognitive processing before decisions can be made. In this domain, a sequential
and interpretive understanding of visual cues is essential for effective
perception, prediction, and planning. Nevertheless, common VQA benchmarks often
focus on the accuracy of the final answer while overlooking the reasoning
process that enables the generation of accurate responses. Moreover, existing
methods lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating step-by-step reasoning in
realistic driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DriveLMM-o1, a new
dataset and benchmark specifically designed to advance step-wise visual
reasoning for autonomous driving. Our benchmark features over 18k VQA examples
in the training set and more than 4k in the test set, covering diverse
questions on perception, prediction, and planning, each enriched with
step-by-step reasoning to ensure logical inference in autonomous driving
scenarios. We further introduce a large multimodal model that is fine-tuned on
our reasoning dataset, demonstrating robust performance in complex driving
scenarios. In addition, we benchmark various open-source and closed-source
methods on our proposed dataset, systematically comparing their reasoning
capabilities for autonomous driving tasks. Our model achieves a +7.49% gain in
final answer accuracy, along with a 3.62% improvement in reasoning score over
the previous best open-source model. Our framework, dataset, and model are

<p class='card-text'>This paper addresses the Dubins path planning problem for vehicles in 3D
space. In particular, we consider the problem of computing CSC paths -- paths
that consist of a circular arc (C) followed by a straight segment (S) followed
by a circular arc (C). These paths are useful for vehicles such as fixed-wing
aircraft and underwater submersibles that are subject to lower bounds on turn
radius. We present a new parameterization that reduces the 3D CSC planning
problem to a search over 2 variables, thus lowering search complexity, while
also providing gradients that assist that search. We use these equations with a
numerical solver to explore numbers and types of solutions computed for a
variety of planar and 3D scenarios. Our method successfully computes CSC paths
for the large majority of test cases, indicating that it could be useful for
future generation of robust, efficient curvature-constrained trajectories.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown promise
for embodied task planning, yet they struggle with fundamental challenges like
dependency constraints and efficiency. Existing approaches either solely
optimize action selection or leverage world models during inference,
overlooking the benefits of learning to model the world as a way to enhance
planning capabilities. We propose Dual Preference Optimization (D$^2$PO), a new

through preference learning, enabling LVLMs to understand environment dynamics
for better planning. To automatically collect trajectories and stepwise
preference data without human annotation, we introduce a tree search mechanism

<p class='card-text'>Achieving unified multi-robot coordination and motion planning in complex
environments is a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a hierarchical
approach to long-range coordination, which we call Stratified Topological
Autonomy for Long-Range Coordination (STALC). In particular, we look at the
problem of minimizing visibility to observers and maximizing safety with a
multi-robot team navigating through a hazardous environment. At its core, our
approach relies on the notion of a dynamic topological graph, where the edge
weights vary dynamically based on the locations of the robots in the graph. To
create this dynamic topological graph, we evaluate the visibility of the robot
team from a discrete set of observer locations (both adversarial and friendly),
and construct a topological graph whose edge weights depend on both adversary
position and robot team configuration. We then impose temporal constraints on
the evolution of those edge weights based on robot team state and use
Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) to generate optimal multirobot plans through
the graph. The visibility information also informs the lower layers of the
autonomy stack to plan minimal visibility paths through the environment for the
team of robots. Our approach presents methods to reduce the computational
complexity for a team of robots that interact and coordinate across the team to
accomplish a common goal. We demonstrate our approach in simulated and hardware
experiments in forested and urban environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Generating human-like and adaptive trajectories is essential for autonomous
driving in dynamic environments. While generative models have shown promise in
synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced
variability of human driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional
shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven
finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion
planning with diverse driving preferences. TrajHF incorporates
multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to
refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation
learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while
maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves PDMS of 93.95

<p class='card-text'>In motion simulation, motion cueing algorithms are used for the trajectory
planning of the motion simulator platform, where workspace limitations prevent
direct reproduction of reference trajectories. Strategies such as motion
washout, which return the platform to its center, are crucial in these
settings. For serial robotic MSPs with highly nonlinear workspaces, it is
essential to maximize the efficient utilization of the MSPs kinematic and
dynamic capabilities. Traditional approaches, including classical washout
filtering and linear model predictive control, fail to consider
platform-specific, nonlinear properties, while nonlinear model predictive
control, though comprehensive, imposes high computational demands that hinder
real-time, pilot-in-the-loop application without further simplification. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach using deep
reinforcement learning for motion cueing, demonstrated here for the first time
in a 6-degree-of-freedom setting with full consideration of the MSPs kinematic
nonlinearities. Previous work by the authors successfully demonstrated the
application of DRL to a simplified 2-DOF setup, which did not consider
kinematic or dynamic constraints. This approach has been extended to all 6 DOF
by incorporating a complete kinematic model of the MSP into the algorithm, a
crucial step for enabling its application on a real motion simulator. The
training of the DRL-MCA is based on Proximal Policy Optimization in an
actor-critic implementation combined with an automated hyperparameter
optimization. After detailing the necessary training framework and the
algorithm itself, we provide a comprehensive validation, demonstrating that the
DRL MCA achieves competitive performance against established algorithms.

<p class='card-text'>Medical Physics education is delivered through accredited programs with
admissions and funding for students determined by individual institutions
providing the educational experiences. Public data from accredited graduate
programs, along with funding data, were used to analyze institutional trends in
this educational market. Temporal trends from 2017 to 2023 show robust growth
in MS graduates, increasing at an average of 17.7 per year, as compared to
steady but modest growth in PhDs, increasing by 3.6 per year. The current
status is there are nearly two MS graduates for every PhD graduate. Trends in
funding show self-funding of students is a dominant pathway in domestic
programs. Those programs dominated by accredited MS education have their
largest fraction of faculty in radiation oncology departments, whereas those
dominated by PhD education have their largest fraction of faculty in radiology
departments. Overall NIH funding in the space of radiation diagnostics and
therapeutics has been largely static over this timeframe, but with a notable 5
year rise in NCI funding. This can be contrasted to a substantial 5X-6X rise in
NIH funding for engineering research in this same period, with significant
increases in trainee funding there. Taken as a whole, this survey shows that
growth in the field of medical physics education is dominated by MS graduates,
presumably servicing the expanded growth needs for well-trained clinical
physicists. However, the research infrastructure that supports PhD training in
medical physics seems likely to be growing modestly and missing the growth
trend of NIH funding that appears to show substantially more growth in
non-accredited programs such as biomedical engineering. This data is useful to
informing accreditation guidance on numbers of graduates to match the workforce
needs or for inter-institutional planning around education goals.</p>
