<p class='card-text'>Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of
America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring
equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,
water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the
sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables
related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe
negative impact on communities.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art

<p class='card-text'>Robotic cutting is a challenging contact-rich manipulation task where the
robot must simultaneously negotiate unknown object mechanics, large contact

control scheme that enables knife rocking motion for robot manipulators,
without pre-planned trajectories or precise information of the environment.
Motion is generated through interconnection with virtual mechanisms, given by
virtual springs, dampers, and masses arranged in a suitable way. Through
analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that the controlled robot behavior
settles into a periodic motion. Experiments with a Franka manipulator
demonstrate robust cuts with five different vegetables, and sub-millimeter
slice accuracy from 1 mm to 6 mm at nearly one cut per second. The same
controller survives changes in knife shape and cutting board height, and
adaptation to a different humanoid manipulator, demonstrating robustness and

<p class='card-text'>Manipulating matter with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) enables
creation of atomically defined artificial structures that host designer quantum
states. However, the time-consuming nature of the manipulation process, coupled
with the sensitivity of the STM tip, constrains the exploration of diverse
configurations and limits the size of designed features. In this study, we
present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for creating artificial
structures by spatially manipulating carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on a copper
substrate using the STM tip. The automated workflow combines molecule detection
and manipulation, employing deep learning-based object detection to locate CO
molecules and linear assignment algorithms to allocate these molecules to
designated target sites. We initially perform molecule maneuvering based on
randomized parameter sampling for sample bias, tunneling current setpoint and
manipulation speed. This dataset is then structured into an action trajectory
used to train an RL agent. The model is subsequently deployed on the STM for
real-time fine-tuning of manipulation parameters during structure construction.
Our approach incorporates path planning protocols coupled with active drift
compensation to enable atomically precise fabrication of structures with
significantly reduced human input while realizing larger-scale artificial
lattices with desired electronic properties. To underpin of efficiency of our
approach we demonstrate the automated construction of an extended artificial
graphene lattice and confirm the existence of characteristic Dirac point in its
electronic structure. Further challenges to RL-based structural assembly
scalability are discussed.</p>

  Multimodal Feature Fusion for Accurate 3D Whole-Heart Segmentation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Jierui Qu, Jianchun Zhao</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate whole-heart segmentation is a critical component in the precise
diagnosis and interventional planning of cardiovascular diseases. Integrating
complementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation
accuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods
face several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities
hinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack
adaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are
decoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a
dual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature
alignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal
3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network
to process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign
module between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention
mechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a
reinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that
consistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features
are then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an
ensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from
individual patches to produce the final segmentation result. Experimental
results on the publicly available MM-WHS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the
proposed RL-U$^2$Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving
Dice coefficients of 93.1% on CT and 87.0% on MRI, thereby validating the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Computer perception (CP) technologies (digital phenotyping, affective
computing and related passive sensing approaches) offer unprecedented
opportunities to personalize healthcare, but provoke concerns about privacy,
bias and the erosion of empathic, relationship-centered practice. A
comprehensive understanding of perceived risks, benefits, and implementation
challenges from those who design, deploy and experience these tools in
real-world settings remains elusive. This study provides the first
evidence-based account of key stakeholder perspectives on the relational,
technical, and governance challenges raised by the integration of CP
technologies into patient care. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured
interviews with 102 stakeholders: adolescent patients and their caregivers,
frontline clinicians, technology developers, and ethics, legal, policy or
philosophy scholars. Transcripts underwent thematic analysis by a
multidisciplinary team; reliability was enhanced through double coding and
consensus adjudication. Stakeholders articulated seven interlocking concern
domains: (1) trustworthiness and data integrity; (2) patient-specific
relevance; (3) utility and workflow integration; (4) regulation and governance;
(5) privacy and data protection; (6) direct and indirect patient harms; and (7)
philosophical critiques of reductionism. To operationalize humanistic
safeguards, we propose "personalized roadmaps": co-designed plans that
predetermine which metrics will be monitored, how and when feedback is shared,
thresholds for clinical action, and procedures for reconciling discrepancies
between algorithmic inferences and lived experience. By translating these
insights into personalized roadmaps, we offer a practical framework for
developers, clinicians and policymakers seeking to harness continuous
behavioral data while preserving the humanistic core of care.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-robot coordination is crucial for autonomous systems, yet real-world
deployments often encounter various failures. These include both temporary and
permanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly
degrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite
its practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in
the literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the
complexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware
coordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot
target tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our
approach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1)
probabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent
sensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding
inferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or
communication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized
behavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned
into subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and
collaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots
experiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate
independently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them
to contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate
our method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive
assessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our
framework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments
with unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for
the multi-robot systems community.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-04 15:15:29</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Modern data analytic workloads increasingly require handling multiple data
models simultaneously. Two primary approaches meet this need: polyglot
persistence and multi-model database systems. Polyglot persistence employs a
coordinator program to manage several independent database systems but suffers
from high communication costs due to its physically disaggregated architecture.
Meanwhile, existing multi-model database systems rely on a single storage
engine optimized for a specific data model, resulting in inefficient processing
across diverse data models. To address these limitations, we present M2, a
multi-model analytic system with integrated storage engines. M2 treats all data
models as first-class entities, composing query plans that incorporate
operations across models. To effectively combine data from different models,
the system introduces a specialized inter-model join algorithm called
multi-stage hash join. Our evaluation demonstrates that M2 outperforms existing
approaches by up to 188x speedup on multi-model analytics, confirming the

<p class='card-text'>Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies heating (ICRH) and current drive will be
essential for sustaining high-performance plasmas in next-generation fusion
devices (e.g. ITER, SPARC). ICRH actuators routinely produce localized hot
spots on limiters and nearby components, posing serious risks to antenna
reliability, material survivability, and overall plasma performance.
Remarkably, these hot spots are often strongly asymmetric, even with nominally
symmetric plasma conditions and antenna geometries. We show that such
asymmetries exist intrinsically in the wave physics rather than solely being
due to misalignment or edge plasma variation. Our results strongly suggest that
this asymmetry can be compensated for by using either poloidal phasing control
(which e.g. the under construction WEST traveling wave antenna can do) or
modified limiter shapes, suppressing peak sputtering by a factor $\sim$3 and
reducing total erosion by a factor of $\sim$2 compared to state-of-the-art
designs. This capability is essential for sustaining high-power, long-duration
ICRH operation in reactor-scale devices and other next-generation fusion
systems. By distributing heat and particle fluxes more evenly across antenna
surfaces, optimized limiter shaping provides a clear pathway to robust,
reliable ICRH performance in existing and planned fusion devices.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-04 12:35:07</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper proposes an adaptive lattice-based motion planning solution to
address the problem of generating feasible trajectories for systems,
represented by a linearly parameterizable non-linear model operating within a
cluttered environment. The system model is considered to have uncertain model
parameters. The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update
the model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic
estimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error
reduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives
generated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model
selected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also
equipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal
estimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall
motion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the
size of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter. The adaptive
learning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well
as in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter
and the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of
the implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go
arbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with
the true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion
planning performance over time. The efficiency of the motion planner is
demonstrated by a suitable simulation example that considers a drone model
represented by Euler-Lagrange dynamics containing uncertain parameters and
operating within a cluttered environment.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-04 12:08:12</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient
method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the
selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition
functions. This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can
lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements
to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and
acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have
been explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these
fundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to
rely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective
framework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition
Function Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a
lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various
kernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration
before expensive evaluations. BOOST partitions data-in-hand into two subsets: a
reference subset and a query subset, and it prepares all possible
kernel-acquisition pairs from the user's chosen candidates. For each
configuration, BOOST conducts internal BO runs using the reference subset,
evaluating how effectively each pair guides the search toward the optimum in
the unknown query subset, thereby identifying the configuration with the best
retrospective performance for future optimization. Experiments on both
synthetic benchmark functions and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks
demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO approaches with
fixed hyperparameters, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse

<p class='card-text'>Access to comprehensive flight operations data remains severely restricted in
aviation due to commercial sensitivity and competitive considerations,
hindering the development of predictive models for operational planning. This
paper investigates whether synthetic data can effectively replace real
operational data for training machine learning models in pre-tactical aviation
scenarios-predictions made hours to days before operations using only scheduled
flight information. We evaluate four state-of-the-art synthetic data generators
on three prediction tasks: aircraft turnaround time, departure delays, and
arrival delays. Using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) methodology on
over 1.7 million European flight records, we first validate synthetic data
quality through fidelity assessments, then assess both predictive performance
and the preservation of operational relationships. Our results show that
advanced neural network architectures, specifically transformer-based
generators, can retain 94-97% of real-data predictive performance while
maintaining feature importance patterns informative for operational
decision-making. Our analysis reveals that even with real data, prediction
accuracy is inherently limited when only scheduled information is
available-establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. These
findings suggest that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to
aviation analytics capabilities while preserving commercial confidentiality,
though stakeholders must maintain realistic expectations about pre-tactical

<p class='card-text'>Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose

<p class='card-text'>We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE)
minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in
arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy
minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem
into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational
techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space
models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on
environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially
observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform
conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and
efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld
environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially
observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.
This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations,
providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in
artificial agents.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-04 08:07:31</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Purpose: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is a serious complication of
intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for breast cancer patients,
underscoring the need for precise and explainable predictive models. This study
presents an Explainable Dual-Omics Filtering (EDOF) model that integrates
spatially localized dosiomic and radiomic features for voxel-level RP
prediction.
  Methods: A retrospective cohort of 72 breast cancer patients treated with
IMRT was analyzed, including 28 who developed RP. The EDOF model consists of
two components: (1) dosiomic filtering, which extracts local dose intensity and
spatial distribution features from planning dose maps, and (2) radiomic
filtering, which captures texture-based features from pre-treatment CT scans.
These features are jointly analyzed using the Explainable Boosting Machine
(EBM), a transparent machine learning model that enables feature-specific risk
evaluation. Model performance was assessed using five-fold cross-validation,
reporting area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Feature
importance was quantified by mean absolute scores, and Partial Dependence Plots
(PDPs) were used to visualize nonlinear relationships between RP risk and
dual-omic features.
  Results: The EDOF model achieved strong predictive performance (AUC = 0.95 +-
0.01; sensitivity = 0.81 +- 0.05). The most influential features included
dosiomic Intensity Mean, dosiomic Intensity Mean Absolute Deviation, and
radiomic SRLGLE. PDPs revealed that RP risk increases beyond 5 Gy and rises
sharply between 10-30 Gy, consistent with clinical dose thresholds. SRLGLE also
captured structural heterogeneity linked to RP in specific lung regions.
  Conclusion: The EDOF framework enables spatially resolved, explainable RP
prediction and may support personalized radiation planning to mitigate
pulmonary toxicity.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.</p>

<p class='card-text'>World models have become increasingly popular in acting as learned traffic
simulators. Recent work has explored replacing traditional traffic simulators
with world models for policy training. In this work, we explore the robustness
of existing metrics to evaluate world models as traffic simulators to see if
the same metrics are suitable for evaluating a world model as a
pseudo-environment for policy training. Specifically, we analyze the metametric
employed by the Waymo Open Sim-Agents Challenge (WOSAC) and compare world model
predictions on standard scenarios where the agents are fully or partially
controlled by the world model (partial replay). Furthermore, since we are
interested in evaluating the ego action-conditioned world model, we extend the
standard WOSAC evaluation domain to include agents that are causal to the ego
vehicle. Our evaluations reveal a significant number of scenarios where
top-ranking models perform well under no perturbation but fail when the ego
agent is forced to replay the original trajectory. To address these cases, we
propose new metrics to highlight the sensitivity of world models to
uncontrollable objects and evaluate the performance of world models as
pseudo-environments for policy training and analyze some state-of-the-art world

<p class='card-text'>We present a novel MUTE-DSS, a digital-twin-based decision support system for
minimizing underwater radiated noise (URN) during ship voyage planning. It is a
ROS2-centric framework that integrates state-of-the-art acoustic models
combining a semi-empirical reference spectrum for near-field modeling with 3D
ray tracing for propagation losses for far-field modeling, offering real-time
computation of the ship noise signature, alongside a data-driven Southern
resident killer whale distribution model. The proposed DSS performs a two-stage
optimization pipeline: Batch Informed Trees for collision-free ship routing and
a genetic algorithm for adaptive ship speed profiling under voyage constraints
that minimizes cumulative URN exposure to marine mammals. The effectiveness of
MUTE-DSS is demonstrated through case studies of ships operating between the
Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, comparing optimized voyages
against baseline trajectories derived from automatic identification system
data. Results show substantial reductions in noise exposure level, up to 7.14
dB, corresponding to approximately an 80.68% reduction in a simplified
scenario, and an average 4.90 dB reduction, corresponding to approximately a
67.6% reduction in a more realistic dynamic setting. These results illustrate

  Privacy-Preserving Two-Stage Solution</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Yijing Zhang, Md-Ferdous Pervej, Andreas F. Molisch</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-03 19:16:40</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Video caching can significantly improve delivery efficiency and enhance
quality of video streaming, which constitutes the majority of wireless
communication traffic. Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be
designed to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system
revenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested
videos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache
replacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the
replacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache
placement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning.
Motivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution
for revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a
Transformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict
multi-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely
accurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content
popularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand
distribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results
to find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This
latter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we
then transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results
demonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to
that of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching
methods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper
system performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based
optimization approaches.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving
and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video
processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional
KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy
and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world
streaming scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>AI systems and technologies that can interact with humans in real time face a
communication dilemma: when to offer assistance and how frequently. Overly
frequent or contextually redundant assistance can cause users to disengage,
undermining the long-term benefits of AI assistance. We introduce a cognitive
modeling framework based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
(POMDPs) that addresses this timing challenge by inferring a user's latent
cognitive state related to AI engagement over time. Additionally, our framework
incorporates reasoning about the long-term effects of AI assistance, explicitly
aiming to avoid actions that could lead the human user to disengage or
deactivate the AI. A key component of our approach is counterfactual reasoning:
at each time step, the AI considers how well the user would perform
independently and weighs the potential boost in performance against the risk of
diminishing engagement with the AI. Through simulations, we show that this
adaptive strategy significantly outperforms baseline policies in which
assistance is always provided or never provided. Our results highlight the
importance of balancing short-term decision accuracy with sustained user
engagement, showing how communication strategies can be optimized to avoid
alert fatigue while preserving the user's receptiveness to AI guidance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis,
such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond
discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward
continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the
underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,
extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the
dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably
under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as
the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics
solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories
toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To
achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and
(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain
rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to
process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to
extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.
During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future
trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal
current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon
optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,
indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable
performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our
method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road

generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map
informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end
autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art
results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition,
