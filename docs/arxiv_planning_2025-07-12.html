from practical applications in urban and rural public transportation planning.
We establish the problem's complexity and demonstrate inapproximability

<p class='card-text'>Neural networks (NNs) have a great potential for future neutrino telescopes
such as IceCube-Gen2, the planned high-energy extension of the IceCube
observatory. IceCube-Gen2 will feature new optical sensors with multiple
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) designed to provide omnidirectional sensitivity.
Neural networks excel at handling high-dimensional problems and can naturally
incorporate the increased complexity of these new sensors. Additionally, their
fast inference time makes them promising candidates for handling the high event
rates expected from IceCube-Gen2.
  This contribution presents potential applications of neural networks in the
IceCube-Gen2 in-ice optical array. First, we introduce a method to simulate the
IceCube-Gen2 optical modules' photon acceptance using a NN that leverages the
modules' inherent symmetries. Secondly, we present the status of neutrino
NN-based reconstruction efforts, including the adaptation of a novel IceCube
technique that combines normalizing flows with transformer NNs. Finally, we
describe current progress in noise cleaning applications based on node

shown promising results for the forthcoming low-energy extension,

<p class='card-text'>Ensuring reliable and low-latency communication in offshore wind farms is
critical for efficient monitoring and control, yet remains challenging due to
the harsh environment and lack of infrastructure. This paper investigates a
flying base station (FBS) approach for wide-area monitoring and control in the
UK Hornsea offshore wind farm project. By leveraging mobile, flexible FBS
platforms in the remote and harsh offshore environment, the proposed system
offers real-time connectivity for turbines without the need for deploying
permanent infrastructure at the sea. We develop a detailed and practical
end-to-end latency model accounting for five key factors: flight duration,
connection establishment, turbine state information upload, computational
delay, and control transmission, to provide a holistic perspective often
missing in prior studies. Furthermore, we combine trajectory planning,
beamforming, and resource allocation into a multi-objective optimization
framework for the overall latency minimization, specifically designed for
large-scale offshore wind farm deployments. Simulation results verify the
effectiveness of our proposed method in minimizing latency and enhancing
efficiency in FBS-assisted offshore monitoring across various power levels,
while consistently outperforming baseline designs.</p>

  Tumor Motion Forecasting</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-10 14:40:52</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a transformative approach in
healthcare, but its application in personalized patient care remains limited.
This paper aims to present a practical implementation of DT in the management
of chronic diseases. We introduce a general DT framework for personalized care
planning (DT4PCP), with the core components being a real-time virtual
representation of a patient's health and emerging predictive models to enable
adaptive, personalized care. We implemented the DT4PCP framework for managing
Type 2 Diabetes (DT4PCP-T2D), enabling real-time collection of behavioral data
from patients with T2D, predicting emergency department (ED) risks, simulating
the effects of different interventions, and personalizing care strategies to
reduce ED visits. The DT4PCP-T2D also integrates social determinants of health
(SDoH) and other contextual data, offering a comprehensive view of the
patient's health to ensure that care recommendations are tailored to individual

<p class='card-text'>Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Mandibular Angle Split Osteotomy (MASO) is a significant procedure in oral
and maxillofacial surgery. Despite advances in technique and instrumentation,
its success still relies heavily on the surgeon's experience. In this work, a
human-robot collaborative system is proposed to perform MASO according to a
preoperative plan and under guidance of a surgeon. A task decomposition
methodology is used to divide the collaborative surgical procedure into three
subtasks: (1) positional control and (2) orientation control, both led by the
robot for precise alignment; and (3) force-control, managed by surgeon to
ensure safety. Additionally, to achieve patient tracking without the need for a
skull clamp, an optical tracking system (OTS) is utilized. Movement of the
patient mandibular is measured with an optical-based tracker mounted on a
dental occlusal splint. A registration method and Robot-OTS calibration method
are introduced to achieve reliable navigation within our framework. The
experiments of drilling were conducted on the realistic phantom model, which
demonstrated that the average error between the planned and actual drilling
points is 1.85mm.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Understanding and predicting mobility dynamics in transportation networks is
critical for infrastructure planning, resilience analysis, and traffic
management. Traditional graph-based models typically assume memoryless
movement, limiting their ability to capture sequential dependencies inherent in
real-world mobility patterns. In this study, we introduce a novel higher-order
network framework for modeling memory-dependent dynamics in transportation
systems. By extending classical graph representations through higher-order
Markov chains and de Bruijn graph structures, our framework encodes the spatial
and temporal ordering of traversed paths, enabling the analysis of structurally
and functionally critical components with improved fidelity. We generalize key
network analytics, including betweenness centrality, PageRank, and next-step
prediction, to this higher-order setting and validate our approach on the Sioux
Falls transportation network using agent-based trajectory data generated with
MATSim. Experimental results demonstrate that higher-order models outperform
first-order baselines across multiple tasks, with the third-order model
achieving an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and model complexity.
These findings highlight the importance of incorporating memory effects into
network-based transportation analysis and offer a scalable, data-driven

<p class='card-text'>Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) plays a crucial role in medical therapy
planning and robot navigation. Prototype learning methods in MIS focus on
generating segmentation masks through pixel-to-prototype comparison. However,
current approaches often overlook sample diversity by using a fixed prototype
per semantic class and neglect intra-class variation within each input. In this
paper, we propose to generate instance-adaptive prototypes for MIS, which
integrates a common prototype proposal (CPP) capturing common visual patterns
and an instance-specific prototype proposal (IPP) tailored to each input. To
further account for the intra-class variation, we propose to guide the IPP
generation by re-weighting the intermediate feature map according to their
confidence scores. These confidence scores are hierarchically generated using a
transformer decoder. Additionally we introduce a novel self-supervised
filtering strategy to prioritize the foreground pixels during the training of
the transformer decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate favorable

<p class='card-text'>The integration of wireless power transfer (WPT) with Internet of Things
(IoT) offers promising solutions for sensing applications, but faces
significant challenges when deployed in hard-to-access areas such as
high-temperature environments. In such extreme conditions, traditional fixed
WPT infrastructure cannot be safely installed, and batteries rapidly degrade
due to hardware failures. In this paper, we propose an uncrewed aerial vehicle
(UAV)-assisted data collection and WPT framework for batteryless sensor (BLS)
networks deployed in these challenging environments. Specifically, we consider
a practical scenario where a UAV first transfers energy to BLS nodes via WPT,
enabling these nodes to subsequently transmit their collected data to the UAV
through orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Then, we
formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to maximize the fair
data collection volume while minimizing the UAV energy consumption through
joint optimization of transmit power allocation and flight trajectory planning.
Due to the non-convex nature and dynamic characteristics of this problem,
conventional optimization methods prove inadequate. To address these
challenges, we propose an enhanced soft actor-critic algorithm with
parameter-free attention, prioritized experience replay, and value-based reward
centering (SAC-PPV), thereby improving the exploration efficiency and learning
stability of the algorithm in complex WPT scenarios. Simulation results

<p class='card-text'>Query optimization is a fundamental task in database systems that is crucial
to providing high performance. To evaluate learned and traditional optimizer's
performance, several benchmarks, such as the widely used JOB benchmark, are
used. However, in this paper, we argue that existing benchmarks are inherently
limited, as they do not reflect many real-world properties of query
optimization, thus overstating the performance of both traditional and learned
optimizers. In fact, simple but realistic properties, such as joins over string
columns or complex filter predicates, can drastically reduce the performance of
existing query optimizers. Thus, we introduce JOB-Complex, a new benchmark
designed to challenge traditional and learned query optimizers by reflecting
real-world complexity. Overall, JOB-Complex contains 30 SQL queries and comes
together with a plan-selection benchmark containing nearly 6000 execution
plans, making it a valuable resource to evaluate the performance of query
optimizers and cost models in real-world scenarios. In our evaluation, we show
that traditional and learned cost models struggle to achieve high performance
on JOB-Complex, providing a runtime of up to 11x slower compared to the optimal

<p class='card-text'>Ensuring the functional safety of motion planning modules in autonomous
vehicles remains a critical challenge, especially when dealing with complex or
learning-based software. Online verification has emerged as a promising
approach to monitor such systems at runtime, yet its integration into embedded
real-time environments remains limited. This work presents a safeguarding
concept for motion planning that extends prior approaches by introducing a time
safeguard. While existing methods focus on geometric and dynamic feasibility,
our approach additionally monitors the temporal consistency of planning outputs
to ensure timely system response. A prototypical implementation on a real-time
operating system evaluates trajectory candidates using constraint-based
feasibility checks and cost-based plausibility metrics. Preliminary results
show that the safeguarding module operates within real-time bounds and
effectively detects unsafe trajectories. However, the full integration of the
time safeguard logic and fallback strategies is ongoing. This study contributes
a modular and extensible framework for runtime trajectory verification and
highlights key aspects for deployment on automotive-grade hardware. Future work

<p class='card-text'>The construction of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has
recently attracted tremendous attention from both academia and industry. The 5G
and 6G standards have identified LEO satellite networks as a key component of
future mobile networks. However, due to the high-speed movement of satellites,
ground terminals often experience frequent and high-latency handovers, which
significantly deteriorate the performance of latency-sensitive applications. To
address this challenge, we propose a parallel handover mechanism for mobile
satellite networks that can considerably reduce handover latency. The main idea
is to employ plan-based handovers instead of measurement-based handovers to
avoid interactions between the access and core networks, thereby eliminating
the significant time overhead associated with traditional handover procedures.
Specifically, we introduce a novel network function named the Satellite
Synchronized Function (SSF), which is designed to be fully compliant with the
standard 5G core network. In addition, we propose a machine learning model for
signal strength prediction, coupled with an efficient handover scheduling
algorithm. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results demonstrate
that our proposed handover scheme can reduce handover latency by 21\times

approaches, along with significant improvements in network stability and

  Learning</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We present initial results from a planned 10 year survey of Ca II H & K
emission, using observations made with the ARC 3.5m Telescope at Apache Point
Observatory. The primary goal of the survey is to investigate activity cycles
in low mass stars. The sample includes stars chosen from the legacy Mount
Wilson survey carried out by Olin Wilson more than 50 years ago, together with
newly identified planet-host stars and a select sample of early-mid M dwarfs.
This paper presents the first four years of data, comprising 1040 observations
of 271 stars, with a specific focus on K and M stars. We identify a subsample
of 153 stars for continuing observations over the full 10 year survey. Early
results indicate that our data are consistent with the MWO cycle periods over a
time span of more than 50 years; that there is a bifurcation in activity in the
late K range with separate populations of low and high activity stars at lower
masses; and that M dwarf planet hosts tend to be mainly found in the population
of low activity stars, even in the unbiased (by activity) TESS sample,
potentially indicating a link between activity and planet formation. We have
also found indications of possible cyclic variability in some of the lower mass
stars in the sample. Our ultimate goal is to link the activity cycle and
rotation periods in a robust sample of stars spanning FGKM spectral types and
to investigate the implications for the underlying magnetic dynamo.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent decision-making systems are increasingly complicated, making it
crucial to verify and understand their behavior for a given specification. A
promising approach is to comprehensively explain undesired behavior in the
systems modeled by Markov decision processes (MDPs) through formal verification
and causal reasoning. However, the reliable explanation using model-based
probabilistic causal analysis has not been explored when the MDP's transition
probabilities are uncertain. This paper proposes a method to identify potential
causes of undesired behaviors in an uncertain parametric MDP (upMDP) using
parameter sampling, model checking, and a set covering for the samples. A cause
is defined as a subset of states based on a probability-raising principle. We
show that the probability of each identified subset being a cause exceeds a
specified threshold. Further, a lower bound of the probability that the
undesired paths visit the subsets is maximized as much as possible while
satisfying a nonredundancy condition. While computing these probabilities is
complicated, this study derives probabilistically approximately correct lower
bounds of both probabilities by the sampling. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method through a path-planning scenario.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The DarkSide-20k dark matter direct detection experiment will employ a 21 m^2
silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) array, instrumenting a dual-phase 50 tonnes
liquid argon Time Projection Chamber (TPC). SiPMs are arranged into modular
photosensors called Tiles, each integrating 24 SiPMs onto a printed circuit
board (PCB) that provides signal amplification, power distribution, and a
single-ended output for simplified readout. 16 Tiles are further grouped into
Photo-Detector Units (PDUs). This paper details the production of the Tiles and
the quality assurance and quality control (QA-QC) protocol established to
ensure their performance and uniformity. The production and QA-QC of the Tiles
are carried out at Nuova Officina Assergi (NOA), an ISO-6 clean room facility

precision flip-chip bonding, wire bonding, and extensive electrical and optical
validation of each Tile. The overall production yield exceeds 83.5%, matching

<p class='card-text'>We present 4KAgent, a unified agentic super-resolution generalist system
designed to universally upscale any image to 4K resolution (and even higher, if
applied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low
resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at
256x256, into crystal-clear, photorealistic 4K outputs. 4KAgent comprises three
core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline
based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages
vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze
the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration
Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection
paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the
optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face
restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and
selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task
categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new
state-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover
natural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery,
fluorescence microscopy, and medical imaging like fundoscopy, ultrasound, and
X-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g.,
NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic
paradigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and
innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research
communities. We will release all the code, models, and results at:

<p class='card-text'>The widely anticipated outburst of recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB),
which is near the end of its 80-year cycle, provides an excellent opportunity
to search for neutrinos from novae. Novae are an energetic class of transients,
which have been studied for hundreds of years. Because many of them are located
nearby, novae provide an excellent astrophysical laboratory to study
shock-powered emission in our own backyard. Several recent novae have
previously been detected in GeV gamma rays, and the 2021 outburst of RS
Ophiuchi was detected up to TeV energies, with evidence for a hadronic origin
of the observed emission. Previous searches for GeV-TeV neutrinos from novae,
predicted to occur alongside their gamma-ray emission, have been performed
using data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. However, no significant
neutrino signals from novae have yet been observed. We present plans for
follow-up of T CrB in real time with IceCube, using datasets spanning GeV to
PeV neutrino energies. Due to its closer distance and higher optical flux,
which has been well measured in two historical eruptions, the expected neutrino
signal from T CrB is several times stronger than that from RS Ophiuchi.
Furthermore, T CrB is located in the Northern sky at a declination where
IceCube's sensitivity is an additional factor of a few better than at the
location of RS Ophiuchi, which is beneficial to this search.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We consider the problem of decomposing a piecewise constant function on the
circle into a sum of indicator functions of closed circular disks in the plane,
whose number and location are not a priori known. This represents a situation
where an agent moving on the circle is able to sense its proximity to some
landmarks, and the goal is to estimate the number of these landmarks and their
possible locations -- which can in turn enable control tasks such as motion
planning and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, the exact values of the function at
its discontinuities (which correspond to disk boundaries for the individual
indicator functions) are not assumed to be known to the agent. We introduce
suitable notions of robustness and degrees of freedom to single out those
decompositions that are more desirable, or more likely, given this non-precise
data collected by the agent. We provide a characterization of robust
decompositions and give a procedure for generating all such decompositions.
When the given function admits a robust decomposition, we compute the number of
possible robust decompositions and derive bounds for the number of

<p class='card-text'>Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing
immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling
informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality
of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective
multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this
domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and
introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing
the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and
corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning
approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each
tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting
3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node
features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion
process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model
utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism
improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more
effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival
prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for
prognostic models in this context.</p>

<p class='card-text'>A common class of algorithms for informative path planning (IPP) follows
boustrophedon ("as the ox turns") patterns, which aim to achieve uniform area
coverage. However, IPP is often applied in scenarios where anomalies, such as
plant diseases, pollution, or hurricane damage, appear in clusters. In such
cases, prioritizing the exploration of anomalous regions over uniform coverage
is beneficial. This work introduces a class of algorithms referred to as
bounom\=odes ("as the ox grazes"), which alternates between uniform
boustrophedon sampling and targeted exploration of detected anomaly clusters.
While uniform sampling can be designed using geometric principles, close
exploration of clusters depends on the spatial distribution of anomalies and
must be learned. In our implementation, the close exploration behavior is
learned using deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several established
baselines.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Purpose: This work presents the development and pilot implementation of a
comprehensive remote dosimetry audit for Ir-192 High Dose Rate interstitial
brachytherapy, integrating experimental and computational dosimetry procedures
into a unified workflow. TG43 and Model Based Dose Calculations Algorithms
(MBDCAs) are both considered. Methods: A compact, water-equivalent phantom was
designed to hold two catheters, ten Optically Stimulated Luminescent Dosimeters
(OSLDs) and two radiochromic films, enabling point and 2D dose measurements. A
user-selected treatment plan was created using a clinical Treatment Planning
System (TPS), tailored to the optimal dose range of the dosimeters. A
computational dosimetry audit test was also performed via Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations, enabling independent 3D dose calculations for the same plan and
phantom geometry. All dosimetry results were compared to TPS calculations (TG43
and an MBDCA) using the Gamma Index (GI) test, dose difference maps, and
dose-volume histogram comparisons, wherever applicable. The protocol was
designed to minimize clinical workload. Results: This study was completed
within ten days of phantom delivery to the clinic. If necessary, measurements
were corrected using appropriate correction factors determined through side
studies. GI passing criteria were adapted to the uncertainty of each dosimetry
system. Excellent agreement was found between MBDCA and experimental or MC
results. Within the volume of interest, TG43 systematically overestimated dose
compared to MC (median difference: 2.16%), attributed to missing scatter and
phantom material. Conclusion: Despite the labor-intensive workflow, this
protocol supports remote Ir-192 audits with acceptable uncertainties. Combining
experimental and computational methods enhances the robustness of the audit.
This hybrid approach shows clear advantages for rigorous dosimetry auditing
programs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine
interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile
phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks
in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices
raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor
attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual
grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce
vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack
targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when
given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose
VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to
locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.
VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and
does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical
feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can
effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and
highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack
can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,
the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,
e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.
These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor
attack risks in GUI agents.</p>
