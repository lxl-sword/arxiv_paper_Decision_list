  Least-Squares Support Vector Machines</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Dries Dirckx, Wilm Decré, Jan Swevers</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-16 15:41:01</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper details an approach to linearise differentiable but non-convex
collision avoidance constraints tailored to convex shapes. It revisits
introducing differential collision avoidance constraints for convex objects
into an optimal control problem (OCP) using the separating hyperplane theorem.
By framing this theorem as a classification problem, the hyperplanes are
eliminated as optimisation variables from the OCP. This effectively transforms
non-convex constraints into linear constraints. A bi-level algorithm computes
the hyperplanes between the iterations of an optimisation solver and
subsequently embeds them as parameters into the OCP. Experiments demonstrate
the approach's favourable scalability towards cluttered environments and its
applicability to various motion planning approaches. It decreases trajectory
computation times between 50\% and 90\% compared to a state-of-the-art approach
that directly includes the hyperplanes as variables in the optimal control
problem.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping strategic planning, with
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) enabling coordination among
autonomous agents in complex scenarios. However, its practical deployment in
sensitive military contexts is constrained by the lack of explainability, which
is an essential factor for trust, safety, and alignment with human strategies.
This work reviews and assesses current advances in explainability methods for
MARL with a focus on simulated air combat scenarios. We proceed by adapting
various explainability techniques to different aerial combat scenarios to gain
explanatory insights about the model behavior. By linking AI-generated tactics
with human-understandable reasoning, we emphasize the need for transparency to
ensure reliable deployment and meaningful human-machine interaction. By
illuminating the crucial importance of explainability in advancing MARL for
operational defense, our work supports not only strategic planning but also the
training of military personnel with insightful and comprehensible analyses.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In transmission expansion planning (TEP), network planners make long-term
investment decisions while anticipating market clearing outcomes that are
increasingly affected by renewable generation uncertainty. Additionally, market
participants' sensitivity to network charges and the requirement for cost
recovery by the network planner introduce further complexity. Since the
day-ahead market clears before uncertainty realizes, explicitly modelling these
uncertainties at the lower-level market clearing becomes important in bilevel
TEP problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel bilevel TEP framework with
lower-level joint chance-constrained market clearing that manages line flow
constraints under wind uncertainty and accounts for the effect of network
tariffs on participants' actual marginal costs and utility. To solve this
complex problem, we propose a Strengthened Linear Approximation (SLA) technique
for handling Wasserstein distributionally robust joint chance constraints with
right-hand-side uncertainties (RHS-WDRJCC). The proposed method offers more
efficient approximations without additional conservativeness and avoids the
numerical issues encountered in existing approaches by introducing valid
inequalities. The case study demonstrates that the proposed model achieves the
desired out-of-sample constraint satisfaction probability. Moreover, the
numerical results highlight the significant computational advantage of SLA,
achieving up to a 26x speedup compared to existing methods such as worst-case
conditional value-at-risk, while maintaining high solution quality.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Understanding human mobility through Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation
is increasingly important for applications such as urban planning, personalized
services, and generative agent simulation. However, progress in this field is
hindered by two key challenges: the over-reliance on older datasets from
2012-2013 and the lack of reproducible, city-level check-in datasets that
reflect diverse global regions. To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS
(Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale,
publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and
enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 12 geographically and
culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and
longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets. We benchmarked a
wide range of POI recommendation models on Massive-STEPS using both supervised
and zero-shot approaches, and evaluated their performance across multiple urban
contexts. By releasing Massive-STEPS, we aim to facilitate reproducible and
equitable research in human mobility and POI recommendation. The dataset and

<p class='card-text'>The Traffic Assignment Problem is a fundamental, yet computationally
expensive, task in transportation modeling, especially for large-scale
networks. Traditional methods require iterative simulations to reach
equilibrium, making real-time or large-scale scenario analysis challenging. In
this paper, we propose a learning-based approach using Message-Passing Neural
Networks as a metamodel to approximate the equilibrium flow of the Stochastic
User Equilibrium assignment. Our model is designed to mimic the algorithmic
structure used in conventional traffic simulators allowing it to better capture
the underlying process rather than just the data. We benchmark it against other
conventional deep learning techniques and evaluate the model's robustness by
testing its ability to predict traffic flows on input data outside the domain
on which it was trained. This approach offers a promising solution for
accelerating out-of-distribution scenario assessments, reducing computational
costs in large-scale transportation planning, and enabling real-time
decision-making.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Retail energy markets are increasingly consumer-oriented, thanks to a growing
number of energy plans offered by a plethora of energy suppliers, retailers and
intermediaries. To maximize the benefits of competitive retail energy markets,
group purchasing is an emerging paradigm that aggregates consumers' purchasing
power by coordinating switch decisions to specific energy providers for
discounted energy plans. Traditionally, group purchasing is mediated by a
trusted third-party, which suffers from the lack of privacy and transparency.
In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm of decentralized
privacy-preserving group purchasing, empowered by privacy-preserving blockchain
and secure multi-party computation, to enable users to form a coalition for
coordinated switch decisions in a decentralized manner, without a trusted
third-party. The coordinated switch decisions are determined by a competitive
online algorithm, based on users' private consumption data and current energy
plan tariffs. Remarkably, no private user consumption data will be revealed to
others in the online decision-making process, which is carried out in a
transparently verifiable manner to eliminate frauds from dishonest users and
supports fair mutual compensations by sharing the switching costs to
incentivize group purchasing. We implemented our decentralized group purchasing
solution as a smart contract on Solidity-supported blockchain platform (e.g.,
Ethereum), and provide extensive empirical evaluation.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-16 06:13:55</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Background and Objective: Precise preoperative planning and effective
physician training for coronary interventions are increasingly important.
Despite advances in medical imaging technologies, transforming static or
limited dynamic imaging data into comprehensive dynamic cardiac models remains
challenging. Existing training systems lack accurate simulation of cardiac
physiological dynamics. This study develops a comprehensive dynamic cardiac
model research framework based on 4D-CTA, integrating digital twin technology,
computer vision, and physical model manufacturing to provide precise,
personalized tools for interventional cardiology. Methods: Using 4D-CTA data
from a 60-year-old female with three-vessel coronary stenosis, we segmented
cardiac chambers and coronary arteries, constructed dynamic models, and
implemented skeletal skinning weight computation to simulate vessel deformation
across 20 cardiac phases. Transparent vascular physical models were
manufactured using medical-grade silicone. We developed cardiac output analysis
and virtual angiography systems, implemented guidewire 3D reconstruction using
binocular stereo vision, and evaluated the system through angiography
validation and CABG training applications. Results: Morphological consistency
between virtual and real angiography reached 80.9%. Dice similarity
coefficients for guidewire motion ranged from 0.741-0.812, with mean trajectory
errors below 1.1 mm. The transparent model demonstrated advantages in CABG
training, allowing direct visualization while simulating beating heart
challenges. Conclusion: Our patient-specific digital-physical twin approach
effectively reproduces both anatomical structures and dynamic characteristics
of coronary vasculature, offering a dynamic environment with visual and tactile
feedback valuable for education and clinical planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Diffusion models have recently gained prominence in offline reinforcement
learning due to their ability to effectively learn high-performing,
generalizable policies from static datasets. Diffusion-based planners
facilitate long-horizon decision-making by generating high-quality trajectories
through iterative denoising, guided by return-maximizing objectives. However,
existing guided sampling strategies such as Classifier Guidance,
Classifier-Free Guidance, and Monte Carlo Sample Selection either produce
suboptimal multi-modal actions, struggle with distributional drift, or incur
prohibitive inference-time costs. To address these challenges, we propose Prior
Guidance (PG), a novel guided sampling framework that replaces the standard
Gaussian prior of a behavior-cloned diffusion model with a learnable
distribution, optimized via a behavior-regularized objective. PG directly
generates high-value trajectories without costly reward optimization of the
diffusion model itself, and eliminates the need to sample multiple candidates
at inference for sample selection. We present an efficient training strategy
that applies behavior regularization in latent space, and empirically
demonstrate that PG outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies and
planners across diverse long-horizon offline RL benchmarks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>AI automated segmentations for radiation treatment planning (RTP) can
deteriorate when applied in clinical cases with different characteristics than
training dataset. Hence, we refined a pretrained transformer into a hybrid
transformer convolutional network (HTN) to segment cardiac substructures lung
and breast cancer patients acquired with varying imaging contrasts and patient
scan positions. Cohort I, consisting of 56 contrast-enhanced (CECT) and 124
non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans from patients with non-small cell lung cancers
acquired in supine position, was used to create oracle with all 180 training
cases and balanced (CECT: 32, NCCT: 32 training) HTN models. Models were
evaluated on a held-out validation set of 60 cohort I patients and 66 patients
with breast cancer from cohort II acquired in supine (n=45) and prone (n=21)
positions. Accuracy was measured using DSC, HD95, and dose metrics. Publicly
available TotalSegmentator served as the benchmark. The oracle and balanced
models were similarly accurate (DSC Cohort I: 0.80 \pm 0.10 versus 0.81 \pm
0.10; Cohort II: 0.77 \pm 0.13 versus 0.80 \pm 0.12), outperforming
TotalSegmentator. The balanced model, using half the training cases as oracle,
produced similar dose metrics as manual delineations for all cardiac
substructures. This model was robust to CT contrast in 6 out of 8 substructures
and patient scan position variations in 5 out of 8 substructures and showed low
correlations of accuracy to patient size and age. A HTN demonstrated robustly
accurate (geometric and dose metrics) cardiac substructures segmentation from
CTs with varying imaging and patient characteristics, one key requirement for
clinical use. Moreover, the model combining pretraining with balanced
distribution of NCCT and CECT scans was able to provide reliably accurate
segmentations under varied conditions with far fewer labeled datasets compared
to an oracle model.</p>

<p class='card-text'>While the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, its long-term
effects persist through Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), commonly known
as Long COVID. There remains substantial uncertainty regarding both its
duration and optimal management strategies. PASC manifests as a diverse array
of persistent or newly emerging symptoms--ranging from fatigue, dyspnea, and
neurologic impairments (e.g., brain fog), to cardiovascular, pulmonary, and
musculoskeletal abnormalities--that extend beyond the acute infection phase.
This heterogeneous presentation poses substantial challenges for clinical
assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning. In this paper, we focus on
imaging findings that may suggest fibrotic damage in the lungs, a critical
manifestation characterized by scarring of lung tissue, which can potentially
affect long-term respiratory function in patients with PASC. This study
introduces a novel multi-center chest CT analysis framework that combines deep
learning and radiomics for fibrosis prediction. Our approach leverages
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and interpretable feature extraction,
achieving 82.2% accuracy and 85.5% AUC in classification tasks. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of Grad-CAM visualization and radiomics-based feature
analysis in providing clinically relevant insights for PASC-related lung
fibrosis prediction. Our findings highlight the potential of deep
learning-driven computational methods for early detection and risk assessment
of PASC-related lung fibrosis--presented for the first time in the literature.</p>

traffic participants characterized by unpredictable movement patterns.
Additionally, interpreting and adhering to traffic regulations within rapidly
evolving traffic scenarios pose significant hurdles. This paper proposed a
rule-based autonomous vehicle decision-making and planning framework which
extracts right-of-way from traffic rules to generate behavioural parameters,
integrating them to effectively adhere to and navigate through traffic

participants mathematically by formulating the decision-making and planning
problem into a differential game. By finding the Nash equilibrium of the
problem, the autonomous vehicle is able to find optimal decisions. The proposed

<p class='card-text'>Climate change is increasingly recognized as a driver of health-related
outcomes, yet its impact on pharmaceutical demand remains largely understudied.
As environmental conditions evolve and extreme weather events intensify,
anticipating their influence on medical needs is essential for designing
resilient healthcare systems.
  This study examines the relationship between climate variability and the
weekly demand for respiratory prescription pharmaceuticals in Greece, based on
a dataset spanning seven and a half years (390 weeks). Granger causality
spectra are employed to explore potential causal relationships. Following
variable selection, four forecasting models are implemented: Prophet, a Vector
Autoregressive model with exogenous variables (VARX), Random Forest with Moving
Block Bootstrap (MBB-RF), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
  The MBB-RF model achieves the best performance in relative error metrics
while providing robust insights through variable importance rankings. The LSTM
model outperforms most metrics, highlighting its ability to capture nonlinear
dependencies. The VARX model, which includes Prophet-based exogenous inputs,
balances interpretability and accuracy, although it is slightly less
competitive in overall predictive performance.
  These findings underscore the added value of climate-sensitive variables in
modeling pharmaceutical demand and provide a data-driven foundation for
adaptive strategies in healthcare planning under changing environmental

<p class='card-text'>Foundation models can provide robust high-level reasoning on appropriate
safety interventions in hazardous scenarios beyond a robot's training data,
i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) failures. However, due to the high inference
latency of Large Vision and Language Models, current methods rely on manually
defined intervention policies to enact fallbacks, thereby lacking the ability
to plan generalizable, semantically safe motions. To overcome these challenges
we present FORTRESS, a framework that generates and reasons about semantically
safe fallback strategies in real time to prevent OOD failures. At a low
frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses multi-modal reasoners to
identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime monitor triggers a
fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback goals while
inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By bridging
open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate
the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS
outperforms on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety
classification accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot

<p class='card-text'>While large language models demonstrate impressive performance on static
benchmarks, the true potential of large language models as self-learning and
reasoning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. This study
systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation,
and planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of
agents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in
dynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller
ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a
too-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks,
while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting
techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less
improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find
that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable
of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making
align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops.
Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true
emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits
persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and
spatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models
still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through
self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while
reasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math

<p class='card-text'>Finding high-quality solutions quickly is an important objective in motion
planning. This is especially true for high-degree-of-freedom robots.
Satisficing planners have traditionally found feasible solutions quickly but
provide no guarantees on their optimality, while almost-surely asymptotically
optimal (a.s.a.o.) planners have probabilistic guarantees on their convergence
towards an optimal solution but are more computationally expensive.
  This paper uses the AO-x meta-algorithm to extend the satisficing RRT-Connect
planner to optimal planning. The resulting Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect
(AORRTC) finds initial solutions in similar times as RRT-Connect and uses any
additional planning time to converge towards the optimal solution in an anytime
manner. It is proven to be probabilistically complete and a.s.a.o.
  AORRTC was tested with the Panda (7 DoF) and Fetch (8 DoF) robotic arms on
the MotionBenchMaker dataset. These experiments show that AORRTC finds initial
solutions as fast as RRT-Connect and faster than the tested state-of-the-art
a.s.a.o. algorithms while converging to better solutions faster. AORRTC finds

<p class='card-text'>Accurate lymph node metastasis (LNM) assessment in rectal cancer is essential
for treatment planning, yet current MRI-based evaluation shows unsatisfactory
accuracy, leading to suboptimal clinical decisions. Developing automated
systems also faces significant obstacles, primarily the lack of node-level
annotations. Previous methods treat lymph nodes as isolated entities rather
than as an interconnected system, overlooking valuable spatial and contextual
information. To solve this problem, we present WeGA, a novel weakly-supervised
global-local affinity learning framework that addresses these challenges
through three key innovations: 1) a dual-branch architecture with DINOv2
backbone for global context and residual encoder for local node details; 2) a
global-local affinity extractor that aligns features across scales through
cross-attention fusion; and 3) a regional affinity loss that enforces
structural coherence between classification maps and anatomical regions.
Experiments across one internal and two external test centers demonstrate that
WeGA outperforms existing methods, achieving AUCs of 0.750, 0.822, and 0.802
respectively. By effectively modeling the relationships between individual
lymph nodes and their collective context, WeGA provides a more accurate and
generalizable approach for lymph node metastasis prediction, potentially
enhancing diagnostic precision and treatment selection for rectal cancer
patients.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally
invasive surgery (RAMIS) enhances spatial awareness and eliminates manual
viewpoint control. Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track
two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera
orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents
AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve
visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system
uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines
heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust
camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained
99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$
2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally
efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study
(N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training
task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's
viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's
improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary
camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side
manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new
multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-15 15:07:40</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem asks to find a set of paths on a
graph such that when synchronously following these paths the agents never
encounter a conflict. In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called
Classical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are
considered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time
step. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking
into account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can
be safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of
conflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the
body of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying
still at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how
harder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while
planning. Specifically, it was known that Classical MAPF problem on an
undirected graph can be solved in polynomial time, however no complete
polynomial-time algorithm was presented to solve MAPF with large agents. In
this paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard
and, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be
presented. Our proof is based on the prevalent in the field technique of
reducing the seminal 3SAT problem (which is known to be an NP-complete problem)
to the problem at hand. In particular, for an arbitrary 3SAT formula we
procedurally construct a dedicated graph with specific start and goal vertices
and show that the given 3SAT formula is satisfiable iff the corresponding path
finding instance has a solution.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Motion planning problems for physically-coupled multi-robot systems in
cluttered environments are challenging due to their high dimensionality.
Existing methods combining sampling-based planners with trajectory optimization
produce suboptimal results and lack theoretical guarantees. We propose
Physically-coupled discontinuity-bounded Conflict-Based Search (pc-dbCBS), an
anytime kinodynamic motion planner, that extends discontinuity-bounded CBS to
rigidly-coupled systems. Our approach proposes a tri-level conflict detection
and resolution framework that includes the physical coupling between the
robots. Moreover, pc-dbCBS alternates iteratively between state space
representations, thereby preserving probabilistic completeness and asymptotic
optimality while relying only on single-robot motion primitives. Across 25
simulated and six real-world problems involving multirotors carrying a
cable-suspended payload and differential-drive robots linked by rigid rods,
pc-dbCBS solves up to 92% more instances than a state-of-the-art baseline and
plans trajectories that are 50-60% faster while reducing planning time by an

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-15 13:13:41</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The charging scheduling problem of Electric Buses (EBs) is investigated based
on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is
conceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating
periods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time
steps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse
reward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP
into a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical
Double Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is
proposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different
temporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective
policy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while
the low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of
every time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the
charging costs while meeting the charging target. It is proved that the flat
policy constructed by superimposing the optimal high-level policy and the
optimal low-level policy performs as well as the optimal policy of the original
MDP. Since jointly learning both levels of policies is challenging due to the
non-stationarity of the high-level agent and the sampling inefficiency of the
low-level agent, we divide the joint learning process into two phases and
exploit our new HER algorithm to manipulate the experience replay buffers for
both levels of agents. Numerical experiments are performed with the aid of
real-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<p class='card-text'>High-definition (HD) maps offer extensive and accurate environmental
information about the driving scene, making them a crucial and essential
element for planning within autonomous driving systems. To avoid extensive
efforts from manual labeling, methods for automating the map creation have
emerged. Recent trends have moved from offline mapping to online mapping,
ensuring availability and actuality of the utilized maps. While the performance
has increased in recent years, online mapping still faces challenges regarding
temporal consistency, sensor occlusion, runtime, and generalization. We propose
a novel offline mapping approach that integrates trails - informal routes used
by drivers - into the map creation process. Our method aggregates trail data
from the ego vehicle and other traffic participants to construct a
comprehensive global map using transformer-based deep learning models. Unlike
traditional offline mapping, our approach enables continuous updates while
remaining sensor-agnostic, facilitating efficient data transfer. Our method

<p class='card-text'>Research on autonomous robotic surgery has largely focused on simple task
automation in controlled environments. However, real-world surgical
applications require dexterous manipulation over extended time scales while
demanding generalization across diverse variations in human tissue. These
challenges remain difficult to address using existing logic-based or
conventional end-to-end learning strategies. To bridge this gap, we propose a
hierarchical framework for dexterous, long-horizon surgical tasks. Our method
employs a high-level policy for task planning and a low-level policy for
generating task-space controls for the surgical robot. The high-level planner
plans tasks using language, producing task-specific or corrective instructions
that guide the robot at a coarse level. Leveraging language as a planning
modality offers an intuitive and generalizable interface, mirroring how
experienced surgeons instruct traineers during procedures. We validate our
framework in ex-vivo experiments on a complex minimally invasive procedure,
cholecystectomy, and conduct ablative studies to assess key design choices. Our
approach achieves a 100% success rate across n=8 different ex-vivo
gallbladders, operating fully autonomously without human intervention. The
hierarchical approach greatly improves the policy's ability to recover from
suboptimal states that are inevitable in the highly dynamic environment of
realistic surgical applications. This work represents the first demonstration
of step-level autonomy, marking a critical milestone toward autonomous surgical
systems for clinical studies. By advancing generalizable autonomy in surgical
robotics, our approach brings the field closer to real-world deployment.</p>

low, medium and high-cost reference trajectories. Our approach reduces crash

<p class='card-text'>This paper investigates training better visual world models for robot

conditioning on past frames and robot actions. Specifically, we consider world
models that operate on RGB-D frames (RGB-D world models). As opposed to
canonical approaches that handle dynamics prediction mostly implicitly and
reconcile it with visual rendering in a single model, we introduce FlowDreamer,
which adopts 3D scene flow as explicit motion representations. FlowDreamer
first predicts 3D scene flow from past frame and action conditions with a
U-Net, and then a diffusion model will predict the future frame utilizing the
scene flow. FlowDreamer is trained end-to-end despite its modularized nature.
We conduct experiments on 4 different benchmarks, covering both video

method partitions the workspace, assigns fruit-picking sequences to arms,
determines tight and feasible fruit-picking schedules and vehicle travel speed,

throughput achieved by the algorithm was assessed using synthetically generated
fruit coordinates and a harvester design featuring up to 12 arms. The
throughput increased monotonically as more arms were added. Adding more arms
when fruit densities were low resulted in diminishing gains because it took

<p class='card-text'>In the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model for single-lane traffic,
vehicle trajectories follow the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle and can be
represented by a monotone three-dimensional surface of cumulative vehicle
count. In contrast, the generalized bathtub model, which describes congestion
dynamics in transportation networks using relative space, typically violates
the FIFO principle, making its representation more challenging.
  Building on the characteristic distance ordering concept, we observe that
trips in the generalized bathtub model can be ordered by their characteristic
distances (remaining trip distance plus network travel distance). We define a
new cumulative number of trips ahead of a trip with a given remaining distance
at a time instant, showing it forms a monotone three-dimensional surface
despite FIFO violations. Using the inverse function theorem, we derive
equivalent formulations with different coordinates and dependent variables,
including special cases for Vickrey's bathtub model and the basic bathtub
model.
  We demonstrate numerical methods based on these formulations and discuss
trip-based approaches for discrete demand patterns. This study enhances
understanding of the generalized bathtub model's properties, facilitating its

samples, are crucial for treatment planning and predicting outcomes. However,
this manual process is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability

<p class='card-text'>Ensuring safe and human-like trajectory planning for automated vehicles
amidst real-world uncertainties remains a critical challenge. While existing
car-following models often struggle to consistently provide rigorous safety
proofs alongside human-like acceleration and deceleration patterns, we
introduce a novel multi-phase projection-based car-following model. This model
is designed to balance safety and performance by incorporating bounded
acceleration and deceleration rates while emulating key human driving
principles. Building upon a foundation of fundamental driving principles and a
multi-phase dynamical systems analysis (detailed in Part 1 of this study
\citep{jin2025WA20-02_Part1}), we first highlight the limitations of extending
standard models like Newell's with simple bounded deceleration. Inspired by
human drivers' anticipatory behavior, we mathematically define and analyze
projected braking profiles for both leader and follower vehicles, establishing
safety criteria and new phase definitions based on the projected braking
lead-vehicle problem. The proposed parsimonious model combines an extended
Newell's model for nominal driving with a new control law for scenarios
requiring projected braking. Using speed-spacing phase plane analysis, we
provide rigorous mathematical proofs of the model's adherence to defined safe
and human-like driving principles, including collision-free operation, bounded
deceleration, and acceptable safe stopping distance, under reasonable initial
conditions. Numerical simulations validate the model's superior performance in
achieving both safety and human-like braking profiles for the stationary
lead-vehicle problem. Finally, we discuss the model's implications and future
research directions.</p>
