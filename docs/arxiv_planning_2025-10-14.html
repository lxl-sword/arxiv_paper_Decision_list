  Real-Time with Convergence Guarantees</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Samuel G. Gessow, Brett T. Lopez</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-13 17:52:52</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We present an analysis on the convergence properties of the so-called
geometric heat flow equation for computing geodesics (shortest-path~curves) on
Riemannian manifolds. Computing geodesics numerically in real-time has become
an important capability in several fields, including control and motion
planning. The geometric heat flow equation involves solving a parabolic partial
differential equation whose solution is a geodesic. In practice, solving this
PDE numerically can be done efficiently, and tends to be more numerically
stable and exhibit a better rate of convergence compared to numerical
optimization. We prove that the geometric heat flow equation is globally
exponentially stable in $L_2$ if the curvature of the Riemannian manifold is
not too positive, and that asymptotic convergence in $L_2$ is always
guaranteed. We also present a pseudospectral method that leverages Chebyshev
polynomials to accurately compute geodesics in only a few milliseconds for
non-contrived manifolds. Our analysis was verified with our custom
pseudospectral method by computing geodesics on common non-Euclidean surfaces,
and in feedback for a contraction-based controller with a non-flat metric for a
nonlinear system.</p>

  Large Language Models</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Nianyi Lin, Jiajie Zhang, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-13 17:47:50</h6>
<p class='card-text'>A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Enabling humanoid robots to exploit physical contact, rather than simply
avoid collisions, is crucial for autonomy in unstructured environments.
Traditional optimization-based planners struggle with contact complexity, while
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is sample-inefficient and has limited
multi-task ability. We propose a framework combining a learned world model with
sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC), trained on a demonstration-free
offline dataset to predict future outcomes in a compressed latent space. To
address sparse contact rewards and sensor noise, the MPC uses a learned
surrogate value function for dense, robust planning. Our single, scalable model
supports contact-aware tasks, including wall support after perturbation,
blocking incoming objects, and traversing height-limited arches, with improved
data efficiency and multi-task capability over on-policy RL. Deployed on a
physical humanoid, our system achieves robust, real-time contact planning from
proprioception and ego-centric depth images. Website:

<p class='card-text'>While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in robotic manipulation, their performance in complex reasoning
and long-horizon task planning is limited by data scarcity and model capacity.
To address this, we introduce ManiAgent, an agentic architecture for general
manipulation tasks that achieves end-to-end output from task descriptions and
environmental inputs to robotic manipulation actions. In this framework,
multiple agents involve inter-agent communication to perform environmental
perception, sub-task decomposition and action generation, enabling efficient
handling of complex manipulation scenarios. Evaluations show ManiAgent achieves
an 86.8% success rate on the SimplerEnv benchmark and 95.8% on real-world
pick-and-place tasks, enabling efficient data collection that yields VLA models
with performance comparable to those trained on human-annotated datasets.The

  Aggregation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Siheng Xiong, Ali Payani, Faramarz Fekri</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-13 17:02:41</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model
(LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches
typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which
often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off
course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for
smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we
analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning
and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from
incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan
Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan
exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on
the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them
into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design
in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA
module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that
outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K
tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level
preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo
(TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields
more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive
experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method
outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward
RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.</p>

  Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-13 15:41:38</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method to learn robust
control policies for bipedal locomotion. Yet, it can be difficult to tune
desired robot behaviors due to unintuitive and complex reward design. In
comparison, offline trajectory optimization methods, like Hybrid Zero Dynamics,
offer more tuneable, interpretable, and mathematically grounded motion plans
for high-dimensional legged systems. However, these methods often remain
brittle to real-world disturbances like external perturbations.
  In this work, we present NaviGait, a hierarchical framework that combines the
structure of trajectory optimization with the adaptability of RL for robust and
intuitive locomotion control. NaviGait leverages a library of offline-optimized
gaits and smoothly interpolates between them to produce continuous reference
motions in response to high-level commands. The policy provides both
joint-level and velocity command residual corrections to modulate and stabilize
the reference trajectories in the gait library. One notable advantage of
NaviGait is that it dramatically simplifies reward design by encoding rich
motion priors from trajectory optimization, reducing the need for finely tuned
shaping terms and enabling more stable and interpretable learning. Our
experimental results demonstrate that NaviGait enables faster training compared
to conventional and imitation-based RL, and produces motions that remain
closest to the original reference. Overall, by decoupling high-level motion
generation from low-level correction, NaviGait offers a more scalable and
generalizable approach for achieving dynamic and robust locomotion.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Games have long been a microcosm for studying planning and reasoning in both
natural and artificial intelligence, especially with a focus on expert-level or
even super-human play. But real life also pushes human intelligence along a
different frontier, requiring people to flexibly navigate decision-making
problems that they have never thought about before. Here, we use novice
gameplay to study how people make decisions and form judgments in new problem
settings. We show that people are systematic and adaptively rational in how
they play a game for the first time, or evaluate a game (e.g., how fair or how
fun it is likely to be) before they have played it even once. We explain these
capacities via a computational cognitive model that we call the "Intuitive
Gamer". The model is based on mechanisms of fast and flat (depth-limited)
goal-directed probabilistic simulation--analogous to those used in Monte Carlo
tree-search models of expert game-play, but scaled down to use very few
stochastic samples, simple goal heuristics for evaluating actions, and no deep
search. In a series of large-scale behavioral studies with over 1000
participants and 121 two-player strategic board games (almost all novel to our
participants), our model quantitatively captures human judgments and decisions
varying the amount and kind of experience people have with a game--from no
experience at all ("just thinking"), to a single round of play, to indirect
experience watching another person and predicting how they should play--and
does so significantly better than much more compute-intensive expert-level
models. More broadly, our work offers new insights into how people rapidly
evaluate, act, and make suggestions when encountering novel problems, and could
inform the design of more flexible and human-like AI systems that can determine
not just how to solve new tasks, but whether a task is worth thinking about at
all.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared

captures a novel circular feedback: a fraction of cumulative energy output is
reinvested into soil productivity, linking energy use with ecological
regeneration. The dynamics are governed by a nonlinear three-state system
describing soil fertility, residue biomass, and accumulated energy, with a
single control representing the proportion of biomass diverted to energy. The
objective is to maximize a discounted net benefit that accounts for energy
revenue, soil value, and operational costs. We apply the Pontryagin Maximum
Principle in current-value form to derive necessary optimality conditions and
characterize the structure of optimal controls. Numerical simulations based on

<p class='card-text'>Rotor failures in quadrotors may result in high-speed rotation and vibration
due to rotor imbalance, which introduces significant challenges for autonomous
flight in unknown environments. The mainstream approaches against rotor
failures rely on fault-tolerant control (FTC) and predefined trajectory
tracking. To the best of our knowledge, online failure detection and diagnosis
(FDD), trajectory planning, and FTC of the post-failure quadrotors in unknown
and complex environments have not yet been achieved. This paper presents a
rotor-failure-aware quadrotor navigation system designed to mitigate the
impacts of rotor imbalance. First, a composite FDD-based nonlinear model
predictive controller (NMPC), incorporating motor dynamics, is designed to
ensure fast failure detection and flight stability. Second, a
rotor-failure-aware planner is designed to leverage FDD results and
spatial-temporal joint optimization, while a LiDAR-based quadrotor platform
with four anti-torque plates is designed to enable reliable perception under
high-speed rotation. Lastly, extensive benchmarks against state-of-the-art
methods highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach in
addressing rotor failures, including propeller unloading and motor stoppage.
The experimental results demonstrate, for the first time, that our approach
enables autonomous quadrotor flight with rotor failures in challenging
environments, including cluttered rooms and unknown forests.</p>

developed the first AI-based dose engine capable of predicting absorbed dose,
the alpha and beta parameters for relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-
weighted optimisation in carbon ion therapy, delivering MC-level accuracy with
drastically reduced computation time. We extended the transformer-based DoTA
model to predict absorbed dose (C-DoTA-d), alpha (C-DoTA-alpha), and beta

combine dose and energy inputs. The training dataset consisted of ~70,000
pencil beams from 187 head-and-neck patients, with ground-truth values obtained
using the GPU-accelerated MC toolkit FRED. Performance was evaluated on an
independent test set using gamma pass rate (1%/1 mm), depth-dose, and isodose
contour Dice coefficients. MC dropout-based uncertainty analysis was performed.
Median gamma pass rates exceeded 98% for all predictions (99.76% for dose,
99.14% for alpha, and 98.74% for beta), with minima above 85% in the most
heterogeneous anatomies. The Dice coefficient was 0.95 for 1% isodose contours,
with slightly reduced agreement in high-gradient regions. Compared to MC FRED,
inference was over 400x faster (0.032 s vs. 14 s per pencil beam) while
maintaining accuracy. Uncertainty analysis showed high stability, with mean
standard deviations below 0.5% for all models. C-DoTA achieves MC-quality

<p class='card-text'>In the era of mega-constellations, the need for accurate and publicly

guarantee the safety of spacecrafts and the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space
environment. This study critically evaluates the accuracy and reliability of
publicly available ephemeris data for a LEO mega-constellation - Starlink. The
goal of this work is twofold: (i) compare and analyze the quality of the data
against high-precision numerical propagation. (ii) Leverage Physics-Informed
Machine Learning to extract relevant satellite quantities, such as
non-conservative forces, during the decay process. By analyzing two months of
real orbital data for approximately 1500 Starlink satellites, we identify
discrepancies between high precision numerical algorithms and the published
ephemerides, recognizing the use of simplified dynamics at fixed thresholds,
planned maneuvers, and limitations in uncertainty propagations. Furthermore, we
compare data obtained from multiple sources to track and analyze deorbiting
satellites over the same period. Empirically, we extract the acceleration
profile of satellites during deorbiting and provide insights relating to the
effects of non-conservative forces during reentry. For non-deorbiting
satellites, the position Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was approximately 300 m,
while for deorbiting satellites it increased to about 600 m. Through this

<p class='card-text'>Deep learning is expected to aid pathologists by automating tasks such as
tumour segmentation. We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation
model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different
cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from
over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma.
Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over
3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1
500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient
was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in
The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when
comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types.
In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic
tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient
populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-13 07:41:47</h6>
<p class='card-text'>End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Modeling interactive driving behaviors in complex scenarios remains a
fundamental challenge for autonomous driving planning. Learning-based
approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models,
removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation
fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer
blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are
common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data
further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning
methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose
Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in
data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first
introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory
into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory
modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient
temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better
capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow
matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation,
which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain
coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive
scenario understanding. Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset
and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner
achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while
effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In future intelligent transportation systems, autonomous cooperative planning
(ACP), becomes a promising technique to increase the effectiveness and security
of multi-vehicle interactions. However, multiple uncertainties cannot be fully
addressed for existing ACP strategies, e.g. perception, planning, and
communication uncertainties. To address these, a novel deep reinforcement
learning-based autonomous cooperative planning (DRLACP) framework is proposed
to tackle various uncertainties on cooperative motion planning schemes.
Specifically, the soft actor-critic (SAC) with the implementation of gate
recurrent units (GRUs) is adopted to learn the deterministic optimal
time-varying actions with imperfect state information occurred by planning,
communication, and perception uncertainties. In addition, the real-time actions
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are demonstrated via the Car Learning to Act
(CARLA) simulation platform. Evaluation results show that the proposed DRLACP
learns and performs cooperative planning effectively, which outperforms other
baseline methods under different scenarios with imperfect AV state information.</p>

<p class='card-text'>While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the

large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors
capturing environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships in a

complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics,
formulated to be directly useful in configuration-space planning. We establish
a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways, where a

<p class='card-text'>Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To

<p class='card-text'>During loading and unloading steps, energy is consumed when cranes lift
containers, while energy is often wasted when cranes drop containers. By
optimizing the scheduling of cranes, it is possible to reduce energy
consumption, thereby lowering operational costs and environmental impacts. In
this paper, we introduce a single-crane scheduling problem with energy savings,
focusing on reusing the energy from containers that have already been lifted
and reducing the total energy consumption of the entire scheduling plan. We
establish a basic model considering a one-dimensional storage area and provide
a systematic complexity analysis of the problem. First, we investigate the
connection between our problem and the semi-Eulerization problem and propose an
additive approximation algorithm. Then, we present a polynomial-time Dynamic
Programming (DP) algorithm for the case of bounded energy buffer and processing
lengths. Next, adopting a Hamiltonian perspective, we address the general case
with arbitrary energy buffer and processing lengths. We propose an exact DP
algorithm and show that the variation of the problem is polynomially solvable
when it can be transformed into a path cover problem on acyclic interval
digraphs. We introduce a paradigm that integrates both the Eulerian and
Hamiltonian perspectives, providing a robust framework for addressing the

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous racing requires tight integration between perception, planning and
control to minimize latency as well as timely decision making. A standard
autonomy pipeline comprising a global planner, local planner, and controller
loses information as the higher-level racing context is sequentially propagated
downstream into specific task-oriented context. In particular, the global
planner's understanding of optimality is typically reduced to a sparse set of
waypoints, leaving the local planner to make reactive decisions with limited
context. This paper investigates whether additional global insights,
specifically time-optimality information, can be meaningfully passed to the
local planner to improve downstream decisions. We introduce a framework that
preserves essential global knowledge and conveys it to the local planner
through QuayPoints regions where deviations from the optimal raceline result in
significant compromises to optimality. QuayPoints enable local planners to make
more informed global decisions when deviating from the raceline, such as during
strategic overtaking. To demonstrate this, we integrate QuayPoints into an
existing planner and show that it consistently overtakes opponents traveling at
up to 75% of the ego vehicle's speed across four distinct race tracks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive

<p class='card-text'>Deep generative models such as conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs)
have shown great promise for predicting trajectories of surrounding agents in
autonomous vehicle planning. State-of-the-art models have achieved remarkable
accuracy in such prediction tasks. Besides accuracy, diversity is also crucial
for safe planning because human behaviors are inherently uncertain and
multimodal. However, existing methods generally lack a scheme to generate
controllably diverse trajectories, which is arguably more useful than randomly
diversified trajectories, to the end of safe planning. To address this, we
propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE framework that uses weakly labeled
preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes. Using
average velocity as an example attribute, we demonstrate that PrefCVAE enables
controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline
