<p class='card-text'>The ALICE Collaboration is planning to construct a new detector (ALICE 3)
aiming at exploiting the potential of the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider
(LHC). The new detector will allow ALICE to participate in LHC Run 5 scheduled
from 2036 to 2041. The muon-identifier subsystem (MID) is part of the ALICE 3
reference detector layout. The MID will consist of a standard magnetic iron
absorber ($\approx4$ nuclear interaction lengths) followed by muon chambers.
The baseline option for the MID chambers considers plastic scintillation bars
equipped with wave-length shifting fibers and readout with silicon
photomultipliers. This paper reports on the performance of a MID chamber
prototype using 3 GeV/$c$ pion- and muon-enriched beams delivered by the CERN
Proton Synchrotron (PS). The prototype was built using extruded plastic
scintillator produced by FNAL-NICADD (Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory -
Northern Illinois Center for Accelerator and Detector Development). The
prototype was experimentally evaluated using varying absorber thicknesses (60,
70, 80, 90, and 100 cm) to assess its performance. The analysis was performed
using Machine Learning techniques and the performance was validated with GEANT
4 simulations. Potential improvements in both hardware and data analysis are
discussed.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

<p class='card-text'>In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.</p>

the simultaneous phonon and scintillation light detection, a unique
event-by-event particle identification is enabled. This dual-channel approach
allows for a model-independent cross-check of the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA
signal with a moderate exposure of a few hundred kg d, while completely
avoiding key systematic uncertainties inherent to scintillation-only NaI-based

<p class='card-text'>Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Path planning algorithms aim to compute a collision-free path, and many works
focus on finding the optimal distance path. However, for some applications, a
more suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and
path length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based
schemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration
space. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being
primarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient
path-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing
time. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on
U-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,
which we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of
the entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the
iterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling
process. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500
bi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a
simulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250
previously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to
quantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that
using SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as
connecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing
processing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable
for mobile service robots in structured environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Forests are frequently impacted by climate conditions, vegetation density,
and intricate terrain and geology, which contribute to natural disasters.
Personnel engaged in or supporting rescue operations in such environments rely
on robust communication systems to ensure their safety, highlighting the
criticality of channel measurements in forest environments. However, according
to current research, there is limited research on channel detection and
modeling in forest areas in the existing literature. This paper describes the
channel measurements campaign of air and ground in the Arxan National Forest
Park of Inner Mongolia. It presents measurement results and propagation models
for ground-to-ground (G2G) and air-to-ground (A2G) scenarios. The measurement
campaign uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals centered at
1.4 GHz for channel sounding. In the G2G measurement, in addition to using
omnidirectional antennas to record data, we also use directional antennas to
record the arrival angle information of the signal at the receiver. In the A2G
measurement, we pre-plan the flight trajectory of the unmanned aerial vehicle
so that it can fly at a fixed angle relative to the ground. We present path
loss models suitable for G2G and A2G in forest environments based on the
analysis of measurement results. The results indicate that the proposed model
reduces error margins compared with other path loss models. Furthermore, we
derive the multipath model expression specific to forest environments and
conduct statistical analysis on key channel parameters e.g., shadow fading
factor, root mean square delay spread, and Rician K factor. Our findings reveal
that signal propagation obstruction due to tree crowns in A2G communication is
more pronounced than tree trunk obstructions in G2G communication. Adjusting
the elevation angle between air and ground can enhance communication quality.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

<p class='card-text'>Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of
joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from
an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation
task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment.
Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are
computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning
can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often
requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural
architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised
approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on
whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce
observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a
cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent
architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of
the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The
results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only
using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that
this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks
requiring adaptive solutions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Various ``cosmic shorelines" have been proposed to delineate which planets
have atmospheres. The fates of individual planet atmospheres may be set by a
complex sea of growth and loss processes, driven by unmeasurable environmental
factors or unknown historical events. Yet, defining population-level boundaries
helps illuminate which processes matter and identify high-priority targets for
future atmospheric searches. Here, we provide a statistical framework for
inferring the position, shape, and fuzziness of an instellation-based cosmic
shoreline, defined in the three-dimensional space of planet escape velocity,
planet bolometric flux received, and host star luminosity; explicitly including
luminosity partially circumvents the need to estimate host stars' historical
X-ray and extreme ultraviolet fluences. Using Solar System and exoplanet
atmospheric constraints, under the restrictive assumption that one planar
boundary applies across a wide parameter space, we find the critical flux
threshold for atmospheres scales with escape velocity with a power-law index of
$p=6.08^{+0.69}_{-0.48}$, steeper than the canonical literature slope of $p=4$,
and scales with stellar luminosity with a power-law index of
$q=1.25^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$, steep enough to disfavor atmospheres on Earth-sized
planets out to the habitable zone for stars less luminous than $\log_{10}
(L_\star/L_\odot) = -2.22 \pm 0.21$ (roughly spectral type M4.5V). If we relax
the assumption that one power law must stretch from the hottest exoplanets to
the coolest Solar System worlds, the narrower question of ``Which warm planets
have thick CO$_2$ secondary atmospheres?" is still poorly constrained by data
but should improve significantly with planned JWST observations.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are believed to path
integrate speed and direction signals to activate at triangular grids of
locations in an environment, thus implementing a population code for position.
In parallel, place cells in the hippocampus (HC) fire at spatially confined
locations, with selectivity tuned not only to allocentric position but also to
environmental contexts, such as sensory cues. Although grid and place cells
both encode spatial information and support memory for multiple locations, why
animals maintain two such representations remains unclear. Noting that place
representations seem to have other functional roles in intrinsically motivated
tasks such as recalling locations from sensory cues, we propose that animals
maintain grid and place representations together to support planning.
Specifically, we posit that place cells auto-associate not only sensory
information relayed from the MEC but also grid cell patterns, enabling recall
of goal location grid patterns from sensory and motivational cues, permitting
subsequent planning with only grid representations. We extend a previous
theoretical framework for grid-cell-based planning and show that local
transition rules can generalize to long-distance path forecasting. We further
show that a planning network can sequentially update grid cell states toward
the goal. During this process, intermediate grid activity can trigger place
cell pattern completion, reconstructing experiences along the planned path. We
demonstrate all these effects using a single-layer RNN that simultaneously
models the HC-MEC loop and the planning subnetwork. We show that such recurrent
mechanisms for grid cell-based planning, with goal recall driven by the place
system, make several characteristic, testable predictions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language
foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for
complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a
lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous
architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact
size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of
embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B
variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary
models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities,
including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial
referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g.,
closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph
updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction,
multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We
hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step
toward building generalist embodied agents. The code, checkpoint and benchmark
are available at https://superrobobrain.github.io.</p>

  Texture After Preventive Maintenance</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Lu Gao, Zia Din, Kinam Kim, Ahmed Senouci</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-02 15:57:52</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This study investigates the deterioration of skid resistance and surface
macrotexture following preventive maintenance using micro-milling techniques.
Field data were collected from 31 asphalt pavement sections located across four
climatic zones in Texas, encompassing a variety of surface types, milling
depths, operational speeds, and drum configurations. A standardized data
collection protocol was followed, with measurements taken before milling,
immediately after treatment, and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-treatment.
Skid number and Mean Profile Depth (MPD) were used to evaluate surface friction
and texture characteristics. The dataset was reformatted into a time-series
structure with 930 observations, incorporating contextual variables such as
climatic zone, treatment parameters, and baseline surface condition. A
comparative modeling framework was applied to predict the deterioration trends
of both skid resistance and macrotexture over time. Eight regression models,
including linear, tree-based, and ensemble methods, were evaluated alongside a
sequence-to-one transformer model. Results show that the transformer model
achieved the highest prediction accuracy for skid resistance (R2=0.981), while
Random Forest performing best for macrotexture prediction (R2 = 0.838). The
findings indicate that the degradation of surface characteristics after
preventive maintenance is nonlinear and influenced by a combination of
environmental and operational factors. This study demonstrates the
effectiveness of data-driven modeling in supporting transportation agencies
with pavement performance forecasting and maintenance planning.</p>

  underdosage and overdosage probabilities of target and organ structures</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-02 14:45:43</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Treatment planning uncertainties are typically managed using margin-based or
robust optimization. Margin-based methods expand the clinical target volume
(CTV) to a planning target volume, generally unsuited for proton therapy.
Robust optimization considers worst-case scenarios, but its quality depends on
the uncertainty scenario set: excluding extremes reduces robustness, while too
many make plans overly conservative. Probabilistic optimization overcomes these
limits by modeling a continuous scenario distribution. We propose a novel
probabilistic optimization approach that steers plans toward individualized
probability levels to control CTV and organs-at-risk (OARs) under- and
overdosage. Voxel-wise dose percentiles ($d$) are estimated by expected value
($E$) and standard deviation (SD) as $E[d] \pm \delta \cdot SD[d]$, where
$\delta$ is iteratively tuned to match the target percentile given
Gaussian-distributed setup (3 mm) and range (3%) uncertainties. The method
involves an inner optimization of $E[d] \pm \delta \cdot SD[d]$ for fixed
$\delta$, and an outer loop updating $\delta$. Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE)
provides accurate and efficient dose estimates during optimization. We
validated the method on a spherical CTV abutted by an OAR in different
directions and a horseshoe-shaped CTV surrounding a cylindrical spine. For
spherical cases with similar CTV coverage, $P(D_{2\%} > 30 Gy)$ dropped by
10-15%; for matched OAR dose, $P(D_{98\%} > 57 Gy)$ increased by 67.5-71%. In
spinal plans, $P(D_{98\%} > 57 Gy)$ increased by 10-15% while $P(D_{2\%} > 30
Gy)$ dropped 24-28%. Probabilistic and robust optimization times were
comparable for spherical (hours) but longer for spinal cases (7.5 - 11.5 h vs.
9 - 20 min). Compared to discrete scenario-based optimization, the
probabilistic method offered better OAR sparing or target coverage depending on
the set priorities.</p>

<p class='card-text'>PathDB is a Java-based graph database designed for in-memory data loading and
querying. By utilizing Regular Path Queries (RPQ) and a closed path algebra,
PathDB processes paths through its three main components: the parser, the
logical plan, and the physical plan. This modular design allows for targeted
optimizations and modifications without impacting overall functionality.
Benchmark experiments illustrate PathDB's execution times and flexibility in
handling dynamic and complex path queries, compared to baseline methods like
Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) guided by an automaton,
highlighting PathDB optimizations that contribute to its performance. PathDB

  Gaussian case on Euclidean space</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Paul Freulon, Nikitas Georgakis, Victor Panaretos</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-02 13:40:21</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The optimal transport problem with squared Euclidean cost consists in finding
a coupling between two input measures that maximizes correlation. Consequently,
the optimal coupling is often singular with respect to Lebesgue measure.
Regularizing the optimal transport problem with an entropy term yields an
approximation called entropic optimal transport. Entropic penalties steer the
induced coupling toward a reference measure with desired properties. For
instance, when seeking a diffuse coupling, the most popular reference measures
are the Lebesgue measure and the product of the two input measures. In this
work, we study the case where the reference coupling is not necessarily assumed
to be a product. We focus on the Gaussian case as a motivating paradigm, and
provide a reduction of this more general optimal transport criterion to a
matrix optimization problem. This reduction enables us to provide a complete
description of the solution, both in terms of the primal variable and the dual
variables. We argue that flexibility in terms of the reference measure can be
important in statistical contexts, for instance when one has prior information,
when there is uncertainty regarding the measures to be coupled, or to reduce
bias when the entropic problem is used to estimate the un-regularized transport
problem. In particular, we show in numerical examples that choosing a suitable
reference plan allows to reduce the bias caused by the entropic penalty.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Collision-free motion planning in complex outdoor environments relies heavily
on perceiving the surroundings through exteroceptive sensors. A widely used
approach represents the environment as a voxelized Euclidean distance field,
where robots are typically approximated by spheres. However, for large-scale
manipulators such as forestry cranes, which feature long and slender links,
this conventional spherical approximation becomes inefficient and inaccurate.
This work presents a novel collision detection algorithm specifically designed
to exploit the elongated structure of such manipulators, significantly
enhancing the computational efficiency of motion planning algorithms. Unlike
traditional sphere decomposition methods, our approach not only improves
computational efficiency but also naturally eliminates the need to fine-tune
the approximation accuracy as an additional parameter. We validate the
algorithm's effectiveness using real-world LiDAR data from a forestry crane
application, as well as simulated environment data.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-02 13:26:33</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper presents a Riemannian metric-based model to solve the optimal path
planning problem on two-dimensional smooth submanifolds in high-dimensional
space. Our model is based on constructing a new Riemannian metric on a
two-dimensional projection plane, which is induced by the high-dimensional
Euclidean metric on two-dimensional smooth submanifold and reflects the
environmental information of the robot. The optimal path planning problem in
high-dimensional space is therefore transformed into a geometric problem on the
two-dimensional plane with new Riemannian metric. Based on the new Riemannian
metric, we proposed an incremental algorithm RRT*-R on the projection plane.
The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is suitable for
scenarios with uneven fields in multiple dimensions. The proposed algorithm can
help the robot to effectively avoid areas with drastic changes in height,
ground resistance and other environmental factors. More importantly, the RRT*-R
algorithm shows better smoothness and optimization properties compared with the
original RRT* algorithm using Euclidean distance in high-dimensional workspace.
The length of the entire path by RRT*-R is a good approximation of the
theoretical minimum geodesic distance on projection plane.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper investigates the problem of computing a two-dimensional optimal
curvature straight line (CS) shortest path for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
to intercept a moving target, with both the UAV (pursuer) and target travelling
at constant speeds. We formulate an optimal control problem that integrates two
critical objectives: avoiding static obstacles and successfully intercepting
the target. The approach introduces constraints derived from obstacle avoidance
and target interception requirements. A geometric framework is developed, along
with sufficient conditions for path optimality under the imposed constraints.
The problem is initially examined in the presence of a single obstacle and
later extended to scenarios involving a finite number of obstacles. Numerical
experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the
proposed model using illustrative examples. Finally, we present a realistic
case study using actual geographic data, including obstacle placement, target
trajectory, and heading angles, to demonstrate the practical applicability and
effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in open-source Visual Language Models (VLMs) such as
LLaVA, Qwen-VL, and Llama have catalyzed extensive research on their
integration with diverse systems. The internet-scale general knowledge
encapsulated within these models presents significant opportunities for
enhancing autonomous driving perception, prediction, and planning capabilities.
In this paper we propose VLAD, a vision-language autonomous driving model,
which integrates a fine-tuned VLM with VAD, a state-of-the-art end-to-end
system. We implement a specialized fine-tuning approach using custom
question-answer datasets designed specifically to improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities of the model. The enhanced VLM generates high-level navigational
commands that VAD subsequently processes to guide vehicle operation.
Additionally, our system produces interpretable natural language explanations
of driving decisions, thereby increasing transparency and trustworthiness of
the traditionally black-box end-to-end architecture. Comprehensive evaluation
on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our integrated system
reduces average collision rates by 31.82% compared to baseline methodologies,
establishing a new benchmark for VLM-augmented autonomous driving systems.</p>

scheduling for on-prem grid computing environments. A key contribution of our
approach is handling uncertainty in both resource usage and duration of the
jobs, a critical aspect in the finance industry where stochastic market

<p class='card-text'>Professional visualization design has become an increasingly important area
of inquiry, yet much of the field's discourse remains anchored in
researcher-centered contexts. Studies of design practice often focus on
individual designers' decisions and reflections, offering limited insight into
the collaborative and systemic dimensions of professional work. In this paper,
we propose a systems-level reframing of design judgment grounded in the
coordination and adaptation that sustain progress amid uncertainty, constraint,
and misalignment. Drawing on sustained engagement across multiple empirical
studies--including ethnographic observation of design teams and qualitative
studies of individual practitioners--we identify recurring episodes in which
coherence was preserved not by selecting an optimal option, but by repairing
alignment, adjusting plans, and reframing goals. We interpret these dynamics
through the lens of Joint Cognitive Systems, which provide tools for analyzing
how judgment emerges as a distributed capacity within sociotechnical activity.
This perspective surfaces often-invisible work in visualization design and
offers researchers a new conceptual vocabulary for studying how design activity
is sustained in practice.</p>
