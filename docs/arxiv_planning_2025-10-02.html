  Sampling-Based Trajectory Optimization</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>We present a unified framework for solving trajectory optimization problems
in a derivative-free manner through the use of sequential convex programming.
Traditionally, nonconvex optimization problems are solved by forming and
solving a sequence of convex optimization problems, where the cost and
constraint functions are approximated locally through Taylor series expansions.
This presents a challenge for functions where differentiation is expensive or
unavailable. In this work, we present a derivative-free approach to form these
convex approximations by computing samples of the dynamics, cost, and
constraint functions and letting the solver interpolate between them. Our
framework includes sample-based trajectory optimization techniques like
model-predictive path integral (MPPI) control as a special case and generalizes
them to enable features like multiple shooting and general equality and
inequality constraints that are traditionally associated with derivative-based
sequential convex programming methods. The resulting framework is simple,
flexible, and capable of solving a wide variety of practical motion planning
and control problems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.</p>

  Trigonometric Functions</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Christopher Montez, Sujeevraja Sanjeevi, Kaarthik Sundar</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-30 16:54:21</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This article presents the first mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based
iterative algorithm to solve factorable mixed-integer nonlinear programs
(MINLPs) with bounded, differentiable periodic functions to global optimality
with an emphasis on trigonometric functions. At each iteration, the algorithm
solves a MILP relaxation of the original MINLP to obtain a bound on the optimal
objective value. The relaxations are constructed using partitions of variables
involved in each nonlinear term and across successive iterations, the solution
of the relaxations is used to refine these partitions further leading to
tighter relaxations. Also, at each iteration, a heuristic/local solve on the
MINLP is used to obtain a feasible solution to the MINLP. The iterative
algorithm terminates till the optimality gap is sufficiently small. This
article proposes novel refinement strategies that first choose a subset of
variables whose domain is refined, refinement schemes that specify the manner
in which the variable domains are refined, and MILP relaxations that exploit
the principal domain of the periodic functions. We also show how solving the
resulting MILP relaxation may be accelerated when two or more periodic
functions are related by a linking constraint. This is especially useful as any
periodic function may be approximated to arbitrary precision by a Fourier
series. Finally, we examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach by
solving a path planning problem for a single fixed-wing aerial vehicle and
present extensive numerical results comparing the various refinement schemes
and techniques.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-30 16:52:13</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Generating large and diverse obstacle datasets to learn motion planning in
environments with dynamic obstacles is challenging due to the vast space of
possible obstacle trajectories. Inspired by hallucination-based data synthesis
approaches, we propose Learning from Hallucinating Critical Points (LfH-CP), a
self-supervised framework for creating rich dynamic obstacle datasets based on
existing optimal motion plans without requiring expensive expert demonstrations
or trial-and-error exploration. LfH-CP factorizes hallucination into two
stages: first identifying when and where obstacles must appear in order to
result in an optimal motion plan, i.e., the critical points, and then
procedurally generating diverse trajectories that pass through these points
while avoiding collisions. This factorization avoids generative failures such
as mode collapse and ensures coverage of diverse dynamic behaviors. We further
introduce a diversity metric to quantify dataset richness and show that LfH-CP
produces substantially more varied training data than existing baselines.
Experiments in simulation demonstrate that planners trained on LfH-CP datasets
achieves higher success rates compared to a prior hallucination method.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-30 16:33:25</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse
solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the
presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing
non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and
computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based
methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a
method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing
optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems
like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable
conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision
between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to
approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several
numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and
compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the
literature.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Robin Lee, Youngho Nam</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-30 16:09:39</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC), particularly its strict
Unique-Cause form, is a cornerstone of safety-critical software verification. A
recent algorithm, "Robin's Rule," introduced a deterministic method to
construct the theoretical minimum of N+1 test cases for Singular Boolean
Expressions (SBEs). However, this approach yields only a single test suite,
introducing a critical risk: if a test case forming a required 'independence
pair' is an illegal input forbidden by system constraints, the suite fails to
achieve 100% coverage. This paper proposes EQ-Robin, a lightweight pipeline
that systematically generates a family of minimal Unique-Cause MC/DC suites to
mitigate this risk. We introduce a method for systematically generating
semantically equivalent SBEs by applying algebraic rearrangements to an
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the expression. By applying
Robin's Rule to each structural variant, a diverse set of test suites can be
produced. This provides a resilient path to discovering a valid test suite that
preserves the N+1 minimality guarantee while navigating real-world constraints.
We outline an evaluation plan on TCAS-II-derived SBEs to demonstrate how
EQ-Robin offers a practical solution for ensuring robust MC/DC coverage.</p>

Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The computation of time-optimal velocity profiles along prescribed paths,
subject to generic acceleration constraints, is a crucial problem in robot
trajectory planning, with particular relevance to autonomous racing. However,
the existing methods either support arbitrary acceleration constraints at high
computational cost or use conservative box constraints for computational
efficiency. We propose FBGA, a new \underline{F}orward-\underline{B}ackward
algorithm with \underline{G}eneric \underline{A}cceleration constraints, which
achieves both high accuracy and low computation time. FBGA operates forward and
backward passes to maximize the velocity profile in short, discretized path
segments, while satisfying user-defined performance limits. Tested on five
racetracks and two vehicle classes, FBGA handles complex, non-convex
acceleration constraints with custom formulations. Its maneuvers and lap times
closely match optimal control baselines (within $0.11\%$-$0.36\%$), while being
up to three orders of magnitude faster. FBGA maintains high accuracy even with
coarse discretization, making it well-suited for online multi-query trajectory
planning. Our open-source \texttt{C++} implementation is available at:
