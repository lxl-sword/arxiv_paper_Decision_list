  Reasoning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Milan Ganai, Rohan Sinha, Christopher Agia, Daniel Morton, Marco Pavone</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Foundation models can provide robust high-level reasoning on appropriate
safety interventions in hazardous scenarios beyond a robot's training data,
i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) failures. However, due to the high inference
latency of Large Vision and Language Models, current methods rely on manually
defined intervention policies to enact fallbacks, thereby lacking the ability
to plan generalizable, semantically safe motions. To overcome these challenges
we present FORTRESS, a framework that generates and reasons about semantically
safe fallback strategies in real time to prevent OOD failures. At a low
frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses multi-modal reasoners to
identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime monitor triggers a
fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback goals while
inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By bridging
open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate
the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS
outperforms on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety
classification accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot
data, and further improves system safety and planning success in simulation and
on quadrotor hardware for urban navigation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>While large language models demonstrate impressive performance on static
benchmarks, the true potential of large language models as self-learning and
reasoning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. This study
systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation,
and planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of
agents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in
dynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller
ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a
too-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks,
while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting
techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less
improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find
that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable
of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making
align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops.
Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true
emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits
persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and
spatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models
still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through
self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while
reasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math
word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important
shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move
beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Tyler Wilson, Wil Thomason, Zachary Kingston, Jonathan Gammell</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-15 17:53:11</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Finding high-quality solutions quickly is an important objective in motion
planning. This is especially true for high-degree-of-freedom robots.
Satisficing planners have traditionally found feasible solutions quickly but
provide no guarantees on their optimality, while almost-surely asymptotically
optimal (a.s.a.o.) planners have probabilistic guarantees on their convergence
towards an optimal solution but are more computationally expensive.
  This paper uses the AO-x meta-algorithm to extend the satisficing RRT-Connect
planner to optimal planning. The resulting Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect
(AORRTC) finds initial solutions in similar times as RRT-Connect and uses any
additional planning time to converge towards the optimal solution in an anytime
manner. It is proven to be probabilistically complete and a.s.a.o.
  AORRTC was tested with the Panda (7 DoF) and Fetch (8 DoF) robotic arms on
the MotionBenchMaker dataset. These experiments show that AORRTC finds initial
solutions as fast as RRT-Connect and faster than the tested state-of-the-art
a.s.a.o. algorithms while converging to better solutions faster. AORRTC finds
solutions to difficult high-DoF planning problems in milliseconds where the
other a.s.a.o. planners could not consistently find solutions in seconds. This
performance was demonstrated both with and without single instruction/multiple
data (SIMD) acceleration.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate lymph node metastasis (LNM) assessment in rectal cancer is essential
for treatment planning, yet current MRI-based evaluation shows unsatisfactory
accuracy, leading to suboptimal clinical decisions. Developing automated
systems also faces significant obstacles, primarily the lack of node-level
annotations. Previous methods treat lymph nodes as isolated entities rather
than as an interconnected system, overlooking valuable spatial and contextual
information. To solve this problem, we present WeGA, a novel weakly-supervised
global-local affinity learning framework that addresses these challenges
through three key innovations: 1) a dual-branch architecture with DINOv2
backbone for global context and residual encoder for local node details; 2) a
global-local affinity extractor that aligns features across scales through
cross-attention fusion; and 3) a regional affinity loss that enforces
structural coherence between classification maps and anatomical regions.
Experiments across one internal and two external test centers demonstrate that
WeGA outperforms existing methods, achieving AUCs of 0.750, 0.822, and 0.802
respectively. By effectively modeling the relationships between individual
lymph nodes and their collective context, WeGA provides a more accurate and
generalizable approach for lymph node metastasis prediction, potentially
enhancing diagnostic precision and treatment selection for rectal cancer
patients.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally
invasive surgery (RAMIS) enhances spatial awareness and eliminates manual
viewpoint control. Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track
two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera
orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents
AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve
visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system
uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines
heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust
camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained
99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$
2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally
efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study
(N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training
task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's
viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's
improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary
camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side
manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new

<p class='card-text'>The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem asks to find a set of paths on a
graph such that when synchronously following these paths the agents never
encounter a conflict. In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called
Classical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are
considered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time
step. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking
into account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can
be safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of
conflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the
body of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying
still at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how
harder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while
planning. Specifically, it was known that Classical MAPF problem on an
undirected graph can be solved in polynomial time, however no complete
polynomial-time algorithm was presented to solve MAPF with large agents. In
this paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard
and, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be
presented. Our proof is based on the prevalent in the field technique of
reducing the seminal 3SAT problem (which is known to be an NP-complete problem)
to the problem at hand. In particular, for an arbitrary 3SAT formula we
procedurally construct a dedicated graph with specific start and goal vertices
and show that the given 3SAT formula is satisfiable iff the corresponding path
finding instance has a solution.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Motion planning problems for physically-coupled multi-robot systems in
cluttered environments are challenging due to their high dimensionality.
Existing methods combining sampling-based planners with trajectory optimization
produce suboptimal results and lack theoretical guarantees. We propose
Physically-coupled discontinuity-bounded Conflict-Based Search (pc-dbCBS), an
anytime kinodynamic motion planner, that extends discontinuity-bounded CBS to
rigidly-coupled systems. Our approach proposes a tri-level conflict detection
and resolution framework that includes the physical coupling between the
robots. Moreover, pc-dbCBS alternates iteratively between state space
representations, thereby preserving probabilistic completeness and asymptotic
optimality while relying only on single-robot motion primitives. Across 25
simulated and six real-world problems involving multirotors carrying a
cable-suspended payload and differential-drive robots linked by rigid rods,
pc-dbCBS solves up to 92% more instances than a state-of-the-art baseline and
plans trajectories that are 50-60% faster while reducing planning time by an

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-15 13:13:41</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The charging scheduling problem of Electric Buses (EBs) is investigated based
on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is
conceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating
periods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time
steps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse
reward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP
into a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical
Double Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is
proposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different
temporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective
policy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while
the low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of
every time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the
charging costs while meeting the charging target. It is proved that the flat
policy constructed by superimposing the optimal high-level policy and the
optimal low-level policy performs as well as the optimal policy of the original
MDP. Since jointly learning both levels of policies is challenging due to the
non-stationarity of the high-level agent and the sampling inefficiency of the
low-level agent, we divide the joint learning process into two phases and
exploit our new HER algorithm to manipulate the experience replay buffers for
both levels of agents. Numerical experiments are performed with the aid of
real-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</p>

information about the driving scene, making them a crucial and essential
element for planning within autonomous driving systems. To avoid extensive
efforts from manual labeling, methods for automating the map creation have
emerged. Recent trends have moved from offline mapping to online mapping,
ensuring availability and actuality of the utilized maps. While the performance
has increased in recent years, online mapping still faces challenges regarding
temporal consistency, sensor occlusion, runtime, and generalization. We propose
a novel offline mapping approach that integrates trails - informal routes used

<p class='card-text'>Research on autonomous robotic surgery has largely focused on simple task
automation in controlled environments. However, real-world surgical
applications require dexterous manipulation over extended time scales while
demanding generalization across diverse variations in human tissue. These
challenges remain difficult to address using existing logic-based or
conventional end-to-end learning strategies. To bridge this gap, we propose a
hierarchical framework for dexterous, long-horizon surgical tasks. Our method
employs a high-level policy for task planning and a low-level policy for
generating task-space controls for the surgical robot. The high-level planner
plans tasks using language, producing task-specific or corrective instructions
that guide the robot at a coarse level. Leveraging language as a planning
modality offers an intuitive and generalizable interface, mirroring how
experienced surgeons instruct traineers during procedures. We validate our
framework in ex-vivo experiments on a complex minimally invasive procedure,
cholecystectomy, and conduct ablative studies to assess key design choices. Our
approach achieves a 100% success rate across n=8 different ex-vivo
gallbladders, operating fully autonomously without human intervention. The
hierarchical approach greatly improves the policy's ability to recover from
suboptimal states that are inevitable in the highly dynamic environment of
realistic surgical applications. This work represents the first demonstration
of step-level autonomy, marking a critical milestone toward autonomous surgical
systems for clinical studies. By advancing generalizable autonomy in surgical
robotics, our approach brings the field closer to real-world deployment.</p>

reconcile it with visual rendering in a single model, we introduce FlowDreamer,
which adopts 3D scene flow as explicit motion representations. FlowDreamer

<p class='card-text'>In the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model for single-lane traffic,
vehicle trajectories follow the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle and can be
represented by a monotone three-dimensional surface of cumulative vehicle
count. In contrast, the generalized bathtub model, which describes congestion
dynamics in transportation networks using relative space, typically violates
the FIFO principle, making its representation more challenging.
  Building on the characteristic distance ordering concept, we observe that
trips in the generalized bathtub model can be ordered by their characteristic
distances (remaining trip distance plus network travel distance). We define a
new cumulative number of trips ahead of a trip with a given remaining distance
at a time instant, showing it forms a monotone three-dimensional surface
despite FIFO violations. Using the inverse function theorem, we derive
equivalent formulations with different coordinates and dependent variables,
including special cases for Vickrey's bathtub model and the basic bathtub
model.
  We demonstrate numerical methods based on these formulations and discuss
trip-based approaches for discrete demand patterns. This study enhances
understanding of the generalized bathtub model's properties, facilitating its

<p class='card-text'>Ovarian cancer remains a challenging malignancy to diagnose and manage, with
prognosis heavily dependent on the stage at detection. Accurate grading and

samples, are crucial for treatment planning and predicting outcomes. However,
this manual process is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability

critical diagnostic step for ovarian cancer. (Methods) This study presents a
deep learning framework for the automated prediction of ovarian cancer stage
(classified into five categories: 0, I, II, III, IV) using routine
histopathological images. We employed a transfer learning approach, fine-tuning
a ResNet-101 convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet. The training

optimization for learning rate, dropout rate, and weight decay was performed
using a genetic algorithm to enhance model performance and generalization.

<p class='card-text'>Ensuring safe and human-like trajectory planning for automated vehicles
amidst real-world uncertainties remains a critical challenge. While existing
car-following models often struggle to consistently provide rigorous safety
proofs alongside human-like acceleration and deceleration patterns, we
introduce a novel multi-phase projection-based car-following model. This model
is designed to balance safety and performance by incorporating bounded
acceleration and deceleration rates while emulating key human driving
principles. Building upon a foundation of fundamental driving principles and a
multi-phase dynamical systems analysis (detailed in Part 1 of this study
\citep{jin2025WA20-02_Part1}), we first highlight the limitations of extending
standard models like Newell's with simple bounded deceleration. Inspired by
human drivers' anticipatory behavior, we mathematically define and analyze
projected braking profiles for both leader and follower vehicles, establishing
safety criteria and new phase definitions based on the projected braking
lead-vehicle problem. The proposed parsimonious model combines an extended
Newell's model for nominal driving with a new control law for scenarios
requiring projected braking. Using speed-spacing phase plane analysis, we
provide rigorous mathematical proofs of the model's adherence to defined safe
and human-like driving principles, including collision-free operation, bounded
deceleration, and acceptable safe stopping distance, under reasonable initial
conditions. Numerical simulations validate the model's superior performance in
achieving both safety and human-like braking profiles for the stationary
lead-vehicle problem. Finally, we discuss the model's implications and future
research directions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Trajectory planning is essential for ensuring safe driving in the face of
uncertainties related to communication, sensing, and dynamic factors such as
weather, road conditions, policies, and other road users. Existing
car-following models often lack rigorous safety proofs and the ability to
replicate human-like driving behaviors consistently. This article applies
multi-phase dynamical systems analysis to well-known car-following models to
highlight the characteristics and limitations of existing approaches. We begin
by formulating fundamental principles for safe and human-like car-following
behaviors, which include zeroth-order principles for comfort and minimum jam
spacings, first-order principles for speeds and time gaps, and second-order
principles for comfort acceleration/deceleration bounds as well as braking
profiles. From a set of these zeroth- and first-order principles, we derive
Newell's simplified car-following model. Subsequently, we analyze phases within
the speed-spacing plane for the stationary lead-vehicle problem in Newell's
model and its extensions, which incorporate both bounded acceleration and
deceleration. We then analyze the performance of the Intelligent Driver Model
and the Gipps model. Through this analysis, we highlight the limitations of
these models with respect to some of the aforementioned principles. Numerical
simulations and empirical observations validate the theoretical insights.
Finally, we discuss future research directions to further integrate safety,
human-like behaviors, and vehicular automation in car-following models, which
are addressed in Part 2 of this study \citep{jin2025WA20-02_Part2}, where we
develop a novel multi-phase projection-based car-following model that addresses
the limitations identified here.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The fields of autonomous systems and robotics are receiving considerable
attention in civil applications such as construction, logistics, and
firefighting. Nevertheless, the widespread adoption of these technologies is
hindered by the necessity for robust processing units to run AI models. Edge-AI
solutions offer considerable promise, enabling low-power, cost-effective
robotics that can automate civil services, improve safety, and enhance
sustainability. This paper presents a novel Edge-AI-enabled drone-based
surveillance system for autonomous multi-robot operations at construction
sites. Our system integrates a lightweight MCU-based object detection model
within a custom-built UAV platform and a 5G-enabled multi-agent coordination
infrastructure. We specifically target the real-time obstacle detection and
dynamic path planning problem in construction environments, providing a
comprehensive dataset specifically created for MCU-based edge applications.
Field experiments demonstrate practical viability and identify optimal
operational parameters, highlighting our approach's scalability and
computational efficiency advantages compared to existing UAV solutions. The
present and future roles of autonomous vehicles on construction sites are also
discussed, as well as the effectiveness of edge-AI solutions. We share our

<p class='card-text'>In the context of mobile navigation in unstructured environments, the
predominant approach entails the avoidance of obstacles. The prevailing path
planning algorithms are contingent upon deviating from the intended path for an
indefinite duration and returning to the closest point on the route after the
obstacle is left behind spatially. However, avoiding an obstacle on a path that
will be used repeatedly by multiple agents can hinder long-term efficiency and
lead to a lasting reliance on an active path planning system. In this study, we
propose an alternative approach to mobile navigation in unstructured
environments by leveraging the manipulation capabilities of a robotic
manipulator mounted on top of a mobile robot. Our proposed framework integrates
exteroceptive and proprioceptive feedback to assess the push affordance of
obstacles, facilitating their repositioning rather than avoidance. While our
preliminary visual estimation takes into account the characteristics of both
the obstacle and the surface it relies on, the push affordance estimation
module exploits the force feedback obtained by interacting with the obstacle
via a robotic manipulator as the guidance signal. The objective of our
navigation approach is to enhance the efficiency of routes utilized by multiple
agents over extended periods by reducing the overall time spent by a fleet in
environments where autonomous infrastructure development is imperative, such as
lunar or Martian surfaces.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In many scientific and industrial applications, we are given a handful of
instances (a 'small ensemble') of a spatially distributed quantity (a 'field')
but would like to acquire many more. For example, a large ensemble of global
temperature sensitivity fields from a climate model can help farmers, insurers,
and governments plan appropriately. When acquiring more data is prohibitively
expensive -- as is the case with climate models -- statistical emulation offers
an efficient alternative for simulating synthetic yet realistic fields.
However, parameter inference using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is
computationally prohibitive, especially for large, non-stationary fields. Thus,
many recent works train neural networks to estimate parameters given spatial
fields as input, sidestepping MLE completely. In this work we focus on a
popular class of parametric, spatially autoregressive (SAR) models. We make a
simple yet impactful observation; because the SAR parameters can be arranged on
a regular grid, both inputs (spatial fields) and outputs (model parameters) can
be viewed as images. Using this insight, we demonstrate that image-to-image
(I2I) networks enable faster and more accurate parameter estimation for a class
of non-stationary SAR models with unprecedented complexity.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Effective education in radiotherapy plan quality review requires a robust,
regularly updated set of examples and the flexibility to demonstrate multiple
possible planning approaches and their consequences. However, the current
clinic-based paradigm does not support these needs. To address this, we have
developed 'Virtual Dosimetrist' models that can both generate training examples
of suboptimal treatment plans and then allow trainees to improve the plan
quality through simple natural language prompts, as if communicating with a
dosimetrist. The dose generation and modification process is accurate, rapid,
and requires only modest resources. This work is the first to combine dose
distribution prediction with natural language processing; providing a robust
pipeline for both generating suboptimal training plans and allowing trainees to

<p class='card-text'>High-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) is a technique for
detecting the atmospheres of close-in planets using the change in the projected
planet velocity over a few hours. To date, this technique has most often been
applied to hot Jupiters, which show a large change in velocity on short
timescales. Applying this technique to planets with longer orbital periods
requires an improved understanding of how the size of the velocity shift and
the observational signal-to-noise ratio impact detectability. We present grids
of simulated Keck/KPIC observations of hot Jupiter systems, varying the
observed planet velocity shift and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), to estimate the
minimum thresholds for a successful detection. These simulations realistically
model the cross-correlation process, which includes a time-varying telluric
spectrum in the simulated data and data detrending via PCA. We test three
different planet models based on an ultra-hot Jupiter, a classical hot Jupiter,
and a metal-rich hot Saturn. For a ${6}\sigma$ detection suitable for retrieval
analysis, we estimate a minimum velocity shift of $\Delta v_\text{pl} \sim {30,
50, 60}$ km/s, compared to an instrumental resolution of 9 km/s, and minimum
SNR $\sim 370, 800, 1200$ for the respective planet models. We find that
reported KPIC detections to-date fall above or near the ${6}\sigma$ limit.
These simulations can be efficiently re-run for other planet models and
observational parameters, which can be useful in observation planning and
detection validation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous navigation in off-road environments remains a significant
challenge in field robotics, particularly for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs)
tasked with search and rescue, exploration, and surveillance. Effective
long-range planning relies on the integration of onboard perception systems

This work introduces Trailblazer, a novel framework that automates the
conversion of multi-modal sensor data into costmaps, enabling efficient path

leverages imitation learning and a differentiable A* planner to learn costmaps
directly from expert demonstrations, enhancing adaptability across diverse

<p class='card-text'>Understanding an agent's intent through its behavior is essential in
human-robot interaction, interactive AI systems, and multi-agent
collaborations. This task, known as Goal Recognition (GR), poses significant
challenges in dynamic environments where goals are numerous and constantly

struggle to adapt to these dynamic scenarios. To address this limitation, we
introduce the General Dynamic GR problem - a broader definition of GR - aimed
at enabling real-time GR systems and fostering further research in this area.
Expanding on this foundation, this paper employs a model-free goal-conditioned

<p class='card-text'>Nanodosimetry relates Ionization Detail (ID) and ionization parameters (Ip)
to biological endpoints relevant for charged-particle radiotherapy. This
supports a more physics-based modeling of biological effectiveness than
traditional dose-response relationships and RBE models. Faddegon et al. (2023)
introduced cluster dose g(Ip) as a physical quantity, bridging ID to the
treatment planning level, which can be directly optimized. We developed a
framework enabling cluster dose optimization via a pencil-beam (PB) algorithm,
and validated against Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The framework, integrated
into the treatment planning toolkit matRad, uses precomputed Ip values obtained
from MC track-structure simulations. We applied our tool for plan optimization
with protons, helium, and carbon ions in a water phantom and a prostate case.
Recalculation with TOPAS showed 3D gamma passing rates >97% (phantom) and >98%
(patient) using a 3%/3mm criterion and a threshold of 10% of the maximum dose.
Cluster dose F5 optimization produced homogeneous target coverage, with heavier

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous vehicles need a complete map of their surroundings to plan and
act. This has sparked research into the tasks of 3D occupancy prediction, 3D
scene completion, and 3D panoptic scene completion, which predict a dense map
of the ego vehicle's surroundings as a voxel grid. Scene completion extends
occupancy prediction by predicting occluded regions of the voxel grid, and
panoptic scene completion further extends this task by also distinguishing
object instances within the same class; both aspects are crucial for path
planning and decision-making. However, 3D panoptic scene completion is
currently underexplored. This work introduces a novel framework for 3D panoptic
scene completion that extends existing 3D semantic scene completion models. We

<p class='card-text'>The surface of Europa experiences a competition between thermally-induced
crystallization and radiation-induced amorphization processes, leading to
changes of its crystalline structure. The non-linear crystallization and
temperature-dependent amorphization rate, incorporating ions, electrons and UV
doses, are integrated into our multiphysics surface model (MSM) LunaIcy,
enabling simulations of these coupled processes on icy moons.
  Thirty simulations spanning 100 000 years, covering the full ranges of albedo
and latitude values on Europa, explore the competition between crystallization
and irradiation. This is the first modeling of depth-dependent crystallinity
profiles on icy moons. The results of our simulations are coherent with
existing spectroscopic studies of Europa, both methods showing a primarily
amorphous phase at the surface, followed by a crystalline phase after the first
millimeter depth. Our method provides quantitative insights into how various
parameters found on Europa can influence the subsurface crystallinity profiles.
  Interpolating upon our simulations, we have generated a crystallinity map of
Europa showing, within the top millimeter, highly crystalline ice near the
equator, amorphous ice at the poles, and a mix of the two at mid-latitudes.
Regions/depths with balanced competition between crystallization and
amorphization rates are of high interest due to their periodic fluctuations in
crystalline fraction. Our interpolated map reveals periodic variations, with
seasonal amplitudes reaching up to 35% of crystalline fraction. These
variations could be detected through spectroscopy, and we propose a plan to
observe them in forthcoming missions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper presents aUToPath, a unified online framework for global

cluttered urban environments. A key component of our framework is a novel
hybrid planner that combines pre-computed lattice maps with dynamic free-space

model predictive control (MPC) to refine the corridors into smooth, dynamically
consistent trajectories. A single optimization problem is used to both generate
a trajectory and its corresponding control commands; this addresses limitations
of decoupled approaches by guaranteeing a safe and feasible path. Simulation
results of the novel planner on randomly generated obstacle-rich scenarios
demonstrate the success rate of a free-space Adaptively Informed Trees*
