  Diffusion</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating
expert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical
applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time
constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene
observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from
expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp
planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we
propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion
model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action
sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy
learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with
autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store
attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing
redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both
simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation
tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to
achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even
when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable
precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its
practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Endowing robots with tool design abilities is critical for enabling them to
solve complex manipulation tasks that would otherwise be intractable. While
recent generative frameworks can automatically synthesize task settings, such
as 3D scenes and reward functions, they have not yet addressed the challenge of
tool-use scenarios. Simply retrieving human-designed tools might not be ideal
since many tools (e.g., a rolling pin) are difficult for robotic manipulators
to handle. Furthermore, existing tool design approaches either rely on
predefined templates with limited parameter tuning or apply generic 3D
generation methods that are not optimized for tool creation. To address these
limitations, we propose RobotSmith, an automated pipeline that leverages the
implicit physical knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) alongside
the more accurate physics provided by physics simulations to design and use
tools for robotic manipulation. Our system (1) iteratively proposes tool
designs using collaborative VLM agents, (2) generates low-level robot
trajectories for tool use, and (3) jointly optimizes tool geometry and usage
for task performance. We evaluate our approach across a wide range of
manipulation tasks involving rigid, deformable, and fluid objects. Experiments
show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both
task success rate and overall performance. Notably, our approach achieves a
50.0\% average success rate, significantly surpassing other baselines such as
3D generation (21.4%) and tool retrieval (11.1%). Finally, we deploy our system
in real-world settings, demonstrating that the generated tools and their usage
plans transfer effectively to physical execution, validating the practicality
and generalization capabilities of our approach.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-17 17:40:12</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In multi-agent systems, signal temporal logic (STL) is widely used for path
planning to accomplish complex objectives with formal safety guarantees.
However, as the number of agents increases, existing approaches encounter
significant computational challenges. Recognizing that many complex tasks
require cooperation among multiple agents, we propose swarm STL specifications
to describe the collective tasks that need to be achieved by a team of agents.
Next, we address the motion planning problem for all the agents in two stages.
First, we abstract a group of cooperating agents as a swarm and construct a
reduced-dimension state space whose dimension does not increase with the number
of agents. The path planning is performed at the swarm level, ensuring the
safety and swarm STL specifications are satisfied. Then, we design low-level
control strategies for agents within each swarm based on the path synthesized
in the first step. The trajectories of agents generated by the two-step policy
ensure satisfaction of the STL specifications. We evaluate our two-stage
approach in both single-swarm and multi-swarm scenarios. The results
demonstrate that all tasks are completed with safety guarantees. Compared to
the baseline multi-agent planning approach, our method maintains computational
efficiency as the number of agents increases, since the computational time
scales with the number of swarms rather than the number of agents.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-17 16:51:03</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Several fragments of the satisfiability problem have been studied in the
literature. Among these, Linear 3-SAT is a satisfaction problem in which each
clause (viewed as a set of literals) intersects with at most one other clause;
moreover, any pair of clauses have at most one literal in common. Planar 3-SAT
is a fragment which requires that the so-called variable-clause graph is
planar. Both fragments are NP-complete and have applications in encoding
NP-hard planning problems. In this paper, we investigate the complexity and
applications of the fragment obtained combining both features. We define Linear
Planar 3-SAT and prove its NP-completeness. We also study the reconfiguration
problem of Linear Planar 3-SAT and show that it is PSPACE-complete. As an
application, we use these new results to prove the NP-completeness of Bounded
Connected Multi-Agent Pathfinding and the PSPACE-completeness of Connected

<p class='card-text'>This study aims to develop and evaluate a digital twin (DT) framework to
enhance adaptive proton therapy for prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy
(SBRT), focusing on improving treatment precision for dominant intraprostatic
lesions (DILs) while minimizing organ-at-risk (OAR) toxicity. We propose a
decision-theoretic (DT) framework combining deep learning (DL)-based deformable
image registration (DIR) with a prior treatment database to generate synthetic
CTs (sCTs) for predicting interfractional anatomical changes. Using daily CBCT
from five prostate SBRT patients with DILs, the framework precomputes multiple
plans with high (DT-H) and low (DT-L) similarity sCTs. Plan optimization is
performed in RayStation 2023B, assuming a constant RBE of 1.1 and robustly
accounting for positional and range uncertainties. Plan quality is evaluated
via a modified ProKnow score across two fractions, with reoptimization limited
to 10 minutes. Daily CBCT evaluation showed clinical plans often violated OAR
constraints (e.g., bladder V20.8Gy, rectum V23Gy), with DIL V100 < 90% in 2
patients, indicating SIFB failure. DT-H plans, using high-similarity sCTs,
achieved better or comparable DIL/CTV coverage and lower OAR doses, with
reoptimization completed within 10 min (e.g., DT-H-REopt-A score: 154.3-165.9).
DT-L plans showed variable outcomes; lower similarity correlated with reduced
DIL coverage (e.g., Patient 4: 84.7%). DT-H consistently outperformed clinical
plans within time limits, while extended optimization brought DT-L and clinical
plans closer to DT-H quality. This DT framework enables rapid, personalized
adaptive proton therapy, improving DIL targeting and reducing toxicity. By
addressing geometric uncertainties, it supports outcome gains in
ultra-hypofractionated prostate RT and lays groundwork for future multimodal
anatomical prediction.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) and their integration
into embodied agents have unlocked powerful capabilities for decision-making.
However, as these systems are increasingly deployed in real-world environments,
they face mounting safety concerns, particularly when responding to hazardous
instructions. In this work, we propose AGENTSAFE, the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the safety of embodied VLM agents under hazardous
instructions. AGENTSAFE simulates realistic agent-environment interactions
within a simulation sandbox and incorporates a novel adapter module that
bridges the gap between high-level VLM outputs and low-level embodied controls.
Specifically, it maps recognized visual entities to manipulable objects and
translates abstract planning into executable atomic actions in the environment.
Building on this, we construct a risk-aware instruction dataset inspired by
Asimovs Three Laws of Robotics, including base risky instructions and mutated
jailbroken instructions. The benchmark includes 45 adversarial scenarios, 1,350
hazardous tasks, and 8,100 hazardous instructions, enabling systematic testing
under adversarial conditions ranging from perception, planning, and action

statistical analysis is presented which demonstrates that the error in the
magnitude residual from a linear approximation to the main sequence is
Gaussian, but with a standard deviation which is much larger, in general, than
the errors in the individual B and V magnitudes. This result is confirmed by a

<p class='card-text'>Capturing human mobility is essential for modeling how people interact with
and move through physical spaces, reflecting social behavior, access to
resources, and dynamic spatial patterns. To support scalable and transferable
analysis across diverse geographies and contexts, there is a need for a
generalizable foundation model for spatiotemporal data. While foundation models
have transformed language and vision, they remain limited in handling the
unique challenges posed by the spatial, temporal, and semantic complexity of
mobility data. This vision paper advocates for a new class of spatial
foundation models that integrate geolocation semantics with human mobility
across multiple scales. Central to our vision is a shift from modeling discrete
points of interest to understanding places: dynamic, context-rich regions
shaped by human behavior and mobility that may comprise many places of
interest. We identify key gaps in adaptability, scalability, and multi-granular
reasoning, and propose research directions focused on modeling places and
enabling efficient learning. Our goal is to guide the development of scalable,
context-aware models for next-generation geospatial intelligence. These models
unlock powerful applications ranging from personalized place discovery and
logistics optimization to urban planning, ultimately enabling smarter and more

<p class='card-text'>The convergence of robotics and virtual reality (VR) has enabled safer and
more efficient workflows in high-risk laboratory settings, particularly
virology labs. As biohazard complexity increases, minimizing direct human
exposure while maintaining precision becomes essential. We propose GAMORA
(Gesture Articulated Meta Operative Robotic Arm), a novel VR-guided robotic

gestures. Unlike existing scripted automation or traditional teleoperation,
GAMORA integrates the Oculus Quest 2, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, and Robot Operating
System (ROS) to provide real-time immersive control, digital twin simulation,
and inverse kinematics-based articulation. The system supports VR-based
training and simulation while executing precision tasks in physical
environments via a 3D-printed robotic arm. Inverse kinematics ensure accurate
manipulation for delicate operations such as specimen handling and pipetting.
The pipeline includes Unity-based 3D environment construction, real-time motion

discrepancy of 2.2 mm (improved from 4 mm), pipetting accuracy within 0.2 mL,
and repeatability of 1.2 mm across 50 trials. Integrated object detection via
YOLOv8 enhances spatial awareness, while energy-efficient operation (50%

<p class='card-text'>Foundation models have revolutionized robotics by providing rich semantic
representations without task-specific training. While many approaches integrate
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) with specialized navigation
architectures, the fundamental question remains: can these pretrained
embeddings alone successfully guide navigation without additional fine-tuning
or specialized modules? We present a minimalist framework that decouples this
question by training a behavior cloning policy directly on frozen
vision-language embeddings from demonstrations collected by a privileged
expert. Our approach achieves a 74% success rate in navigation to
language-specified targets, compared to 100% for the state-aware expert, though
requiring 3.2 times more steps on average. This performance gap reveals that
pretrained embeddings effectively support basic language grounding but struggle
with long-horizon planning and spatial reasoning. By providing this empirical
baseline, we highlight both the capabilities and limitations of using
foundation models as drop-in representations for embodied tasks, offering
critical insights for robotics researchers facing practical design tradeoffs

<p class='card-text'>Digital twins are transforming engineering and applied sciences by enabling
real-time monitoring, simulation, and predictive analysis of physical systems
and processes. However, conventional digital twins rely primarily on passive
data assimilation, which limits their adaptability in uncertain and dynamic
environments. This paper introduces the active digital twin paradigm, based on
active inference. Active inference is a neuroscience-inspired, Bayesian
framework for probabilistic reasoning and predictive modeling that unifies
inference, decision-making, and learning under a unique, free energy
minimization objective. By formulating the evolution of the active digital twin
as a partially observable Markov decision process, the active inference agent
continuously refines its generative model through Bayesian updates and
forecasts future states and observations. Decision-making emerges from an
optimization process that balances pragmatic exploitation (maximizing
goal-directed utility) and epistemic exploration or information gain (actively
resolving uncertainty). Actions are dynamically planned to minimize expected
free energy, which quantifies both the divergence between predicted and
preferred future observations, and the epistemic value of expected information
gain about hidden states. This approach enables a new level of autonomy and
resilience in digital twins, offering superior spontaneous exploration
capabilities. The proposed framework is assessed on the health monitoring and
predictive maintenance of a railway bridge.</p>

We use different gestures for manipulation and achieve 7 DOF (3 DOF each for
translation and rotation, and 1 DOF for scaling). The proposed framework,
called GHAR, is implemented for architectural building models. It augments
virtual CAD models of buildings on the ground, enabling users to manipulate and

<p class='card-text'>Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is essential for mitigating urban
congestion, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods face challenges in
scaling to large networks while maintaining global coordination. Centralized RL
suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack
unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this
paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with
global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a
high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions
and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level
Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To
improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce
an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging
yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets,
leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both
synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale
Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions,
adverse weather, and holiday surges. Experimental results show that HiLight
exhibits significant advantages in large-scale scenarios and remains
competitive across standard benchmarks of varying sizes.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Remote sensing semantic segmentation is crucial for extracting detailed land
surface information, enabling applications such as environmental monitoring,
land use planning, and resource assessment. In recent years, advancements in
artificial intelligence have spurred the development of automatic remote
sensing semantic segmentation methods. However, the existing semantic
segmentation methods focus on distinguishing spectral characteristics of
different objects while ignoring the differences in the elevation of the
different targets. This results in land cover misclassification in complex
scenarios involving shadow occlusion and spectral confusion. In this paper, we
introduce a depth prompting two-dimensional (2D) remote sensing semantic
segmentation framework (DepthSeg). It automatically models depth/height
information from 2D remote sensing images and integrates it into the semantic
segmentation framework to mitigate the effects of spectral confusion and shadow
occlusion. During the feature extraction phase of DepthSeg, we introduce a
lightweight adapter to enable cost-effective fine-tuning of the large-parameter
vision transformer encoder pre-trained by natural images. In the depth
prompting phase, we propose a depth prompter to model depth/height features
explicitly. In the semantic prediction phase, we introduce a semantic
classification decoder that couples the depth prompts with high-dimensional
land-cover features, enabling accurate extraction of land-cover types.
Experiments on the LiuZhou dataset validate the advantages of the DepthSeg
framework in land cover mapping tasks. Detailed ablation studies further
highlight the significance of the depth prompts in remote sensing semantic
segmentation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The cornerstone of cognitive intelligence lies in extracting hidden patterns
from observations and leveraging these principles to systematically predict
future outcomes. However, current image tokenization methods demonstrate
significant limitations in tasks requiring symbolic abstraction and logical
reasoning capabilities essential for systematic inference. To address this
challenge, we propose Discrete-JEPA, extending the latent predictive coding
framework with semantic tokenization and novel complementary objectives to
create robust tokenization for symbolic reasoning tasks. Discrete-JEPA
dramatically outperforms baselines on visual symbolic prediction tasks, while
striking visual evidence reveals the spontaneous emergence of deliberate
systematic patterns within the learned semantic token space. Though an initial
model, our approach promises a significant impact for advancing Symbolic world
modeling and planning capabilities in artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-17 07:59:07</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Imitation learning has driven the development of generalist policies capable
of autonomously solving multiple tasks. However, when a pretrained policy makes
errors during deployment, there are limited mechanisms for users to correct its
behavior. While collecting additional data for finetuning can address such
issues, doing so for each downstream use case is inefficient at deployment. My
research proposes an alternative: keeping pretrained policies frozen as a fixed
skill repertoire while allowing user interactions to guide behavior generation
toward user preferences at inference time. By making pretrained policies
steerable, users can help correct policy errors when the model struggles to
generalize-without needing to finetune the policy. Specifically, I propose (1)
inference-time steering, which leverages user interactions to switch between
discrete skills, and (2) task and motion imitation, which enables user
interactions to edit continuous motions while satisfying task constraints
defined by discrete symbolic plans. These frameworks correct misaligned policy
predictions without requiring additional training, maximizing the utility of
pretrained models while achieving inference-time user objectives.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Humanoid robots often face significant balance issues due to the motion of
their heavy limbs. These challenges are particularly pronounced when attempting
dynamic motion or operating in environments with irregular terrain. To address
this challenge, this manuscript proposes a whole-body control framework for
humanoid robots with heavy limbs, using a model-based approach that combines a
kino-dynamics planner and a hierarchical optimization problem. The
kino-dynamics planner is designed as a model predictive control (MPC) scheme to
account for the impact of heavy limbs on mass and inertia distribution. By
simplifying the robot's system dynamics and constraints, the planner enables
real-time planning of motion and contact forces. The hierarchical optimization
problem is formulated using Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) to
minimize limb control errors and ensure compliance with the policy generated by
the kino-dynamics planner. Experimental validation of the proposed framework
demonstrates its effectiveness. The humanoid robot with heavy limbs controlled
by the proposed framework can achieve dynamic walking speeds of up to 1.2~m/s,
respond to external disturbances of up to 60~N, and maintain balance on
challenging terrains such as uneven surfaces, and outdoor environments.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-17 04:39:51</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool for robots, providing a
structured representation of spatial and semantic relationships for advanced
task planning. Despite their potential, conventional 3D indoor scene graphs
face critical limitations, particularly under- and over-segmentation of room
layers in structurally complex environments. Under-segmentation misclassifies
non-traversable areas as part of a room, often in open spaces, while
over-segmentation fragments a single room into overlapping segments in complex
environments. These issues stem from naive voxel-based map representations that
rely solely on geometric proximity, disregarding the structural constraints of
traversable spaces and resulting in inconsistent room layers within scene
graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to tackle
segmentation inconsistency as a challenge and address it with
Traversability-Aware Consistent Scene Graphs (TACS-Graphs), a novel framework
that integrates ground robot traversability with room segmentation. By
leveraging traversability as a key factor in defining room boundaries, the
proposed method achieves a more semantically meaningful and topologically
coherent segmentation, effectively mitigating the inaccuracies of voxel-based
scene graph approaches in complex environments. Furthermore, the enhanced
segmentation consistency improves loop closure detection efficiency in the
proposed Consistent Scene Graph-leveraging Loop Closure Detection (CoSG-LCD)
leading to higher pose estimation accuracy. Experimental results confirm that
the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of scene
graph consistency and pose graph optimization performance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Every individual carries a unique and personal life story shaped by their
memories and experiences. However, these memories are often scattered and
difficult to organize into a coherent narrative, a challenge that defines the
task of autobiography writing. Existing conversational writing assistants tend
to rely on generic user interactions and pre-defined guidelines, making it
difficult for these systems to capture personal memories and develop a complete
biography over time. We introduce StorySage, a user-driven software system
designed to meet the needs of a diverse group of users that supports a flexible
conversation and a structured approach to autobiography writing. Powered by a
multi-agent framework composed of an Interviewer, Session Scribe, Planner,
Section Writer, and Session Coordinator, our system iteratively collects user
memories, updates their autobiography, and plans for future conversations. In
experimental simulations, StorySage demonstrates its ability to navigate
multiple sessions and capture user memories across many conversations. User
studies (N=28) highlight how StorySage maintains improved conversational flow,
narrative completeness, and higher user satisfaction when compared to a
baseline. In summary, StorySage contributes both a novel architecture for
autobiography writing and insights into how multi-agent systems can enhance
human-AI creative partnerships.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Motion Object Segmentation (MOS) is crucial for autonomous driving, as it
enhances localization, path planning, map construction, scene flow estimation,
and future state prediction. While existing methods achieve strong performance,
balancing accuracy and real-time inference remains a challenge. To address
this, we propose a logits-based knowledge distillation framework for MOS,
aiming to improve accuracy while maintaining real-time efficiency.
Specifically, we adopt a Bird's Eye View (BEV) projection-based model as the
student and a non-projection model as the teacher. To handle the severe
imbalance between moving and non-moving classes, we decouple them and apply
tailored distillation strategies, allowing the teacher model to better learn
key motion-related features. This approach significantly reduces false
positives and false negatives. Additionally, we introduce dynamic upsampling,
optimize the network architecture, and achieve a 7.69% reduction in parameter
count, mitigating overfitting. Our method achieves a notable IoU of 78.8% on
the hidden test set of the SemanticKITTI-MOS dataset and delivers competitive
results on the Apollo dataset. The KDMOS implementation is available at

<p class='card-text'>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated notable promise in autonomous
driving by offering the potential for multimodal reasoning through pretraining
on extensive image-text pairs. However, adapting these models from broad
web-scale data to the safety-critical context of driving presents a significant
challenge, commonly referred to as domain shift. Existing simulation-based and
dataset-driven evaluation methods, although valuable, often fail to capture the
full complexity of real-world scenarios and cannot easily accommodate
repeatable closed-loop testing with flexible scenario manipulation. In this
paper, we introduce a hierarchical real-world test platform specifically
designed to evaluate VLM-integrated autonomous driving systems. Our approach
includes a modular, low-latency on-vehicle middleware that allows seamless
incorporation of various VLMs, a clearly separated perception-planning-control
architecture that can accommodate both VLM-based and conventional modules, and
a configurable suite of real-world testing scenarios on a closed track that
facilitates controlled yet authentic evaluations. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed platform`s testing and evaluation ability with a

<p class='card-text'>In the current quantum computing ecosystem, building complex and integrated
circuits for addressing real-world problems often involves using basic
historical components like Bell states to take advantage of superposition,
entanglement, and coherence. The availability of the simulator and the IBM
quantum computing endeavor through Qiskit further broadens the scope of
application based on domain use. In the NISQ era, however, error mitigation is
a criterion that is applied when comparing a QPU run result with the simulator.
As the real-world scope of application for quantum computing is being
broadened, using simulators as a baseline offers confidence; however, concerns
about computation resources and availability arise in the high-speed
computational regime. As complex problems entail using a larger number of
superconducting physical qubits, what should be the basis of framing a quantum
circuit for building quantum algorithms in a real-world scenario, given
hardware compatibility that should ideally provide confidence baselining with
the simulator outcome? This work implements three base circuits for different
qubit systems in the simulator and corresponding 127-qubit IBM Sherbrooke
superconducting quantum processing units (QPU) to explore the tradeoff between
generalizability, sensitivity of circuit design to parameters, noise
resilience, resource planning, and efficient qubit usage insights.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Predicting individuals' next locations is a core task in human mobility
modelling, with wide-ranging implications for urban planning, transportation,
public policy and personalised mobility services. Traditional approaches
largely depend on location embeddings learned from historical mobility
patterns, limiting their ability to encode explicit spatial information,
integrate rich urban semantic context, and accommodate previously unseen
locations. To address these challenges, we explore the application of CaLLiPer
-- a multimodal representation learning framework that fuses spatial
coordinates and semantic features of points of interest through contrastive
learning -- for location embedding in individual mobility prediction.
CaLLiPer's embeddings are spatially explicit, semantically enriched, and
inductive by design, enabling robust prediction performance even in scenarios
involving emerging locations. Through extensive experiments on four public
mobility datasets under both conventional and inductive settings, we
demonstrate that CaLLiPer consistently outperforms strong baselines,
particularly excelling in inductive scenarios. Our findings highlight the

<p class='card-text'>In robotic fruit picking applications, managing object occlusion in
unstructured settings poses a substantial challenge for designing grasping
algorithms. Using strawberry harvesting as a case study, we present an
end-to-end framework for effective object detection, segmentation, and grasp
planning to tackle this issue caused by partially occluded objects. Our
strategy begins with point cloud denoising and segmentation to accurately
locate fruits. To compensate for incomplete scans due to occlusion, we apply a
point cloud completion model to create a dense 3D reconstruction of the
strawberries. The target selection focuses on ripe strawberries while
categorizing others as obstacles, followed by converting the refined point
cloud into an occupancy map for collision-aware motion planning. Our
experimental results demonstrate high shape reconstruction accuracy, with the
lowest Chamfer Distance compared to state-of-the-art methods with 1.10 mm, and
significantly improved grasp success rates of 79.17%, yielding an overall
success-to-attempt ratio of 89.58\% in real-world strawberry harvesting.
Additionally, our method reduces the obstacle hit rate from 43.33% to 13.95%,

<p class='card-text'>Quadrotor Morpho-Transition, or the act of transitioning from air to ground
through mid-air transformation, involves complex aerodynamic interactions and a
need to operate near actuator saturation, complicating controller design. In
recent work, morpho-transition has been studied from a model-based control
perspective, but these approaches remain limited due to unmodeled dynamics and
the requirement for planning through contacts. Here, we train an end-to-end
Reinforcement Learning (RL) controller to learn a morpho-transition policy and
demonstrate successful transfer to hardware. We find that the RL control policy
achieves agile landing, but only transfers to hardware if motor dynamics and
observation delays are taken into account. On the other hand, a baseline MPC
controller transfers out-of-the-box without knowledge of the actuator dynamics
and delays, at the cost of reduced recovery from disturbances in the event of
unknown actuator failures. Our work opens the way for more robust control of
agile in-flight quadrotor maneuvers that require mid-air transformation.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-16 18:00:00</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We solve the strong CP problem in a broad class of two Higgs doublet theories
that will be probed at the Large Hadron Collider and at future colliders.These
theories feature CP and Abelian flavor symmetries, both broken softly in the
scalar potential, that yield realistic quark masses and mixings. The flavor
symmetry charges are chosen so that $\bar{\theta}=0$ at tree level for all
values of the Yukawa and quartic couplings of the theory. We prove that in all
such theories the 1-loop contribution to $\bar{\theta}$ also vanishes,
independently of the mass scale of the second Higgs doublet. We study two
illustrative models with flavor group $\mathbb{Z}_3$. The direct contributions
to the neutron electric dipole moment are negligible in both models. While the
2-loop contribution to $\bar{\theta}$ is less than $10^{-12}$ in one model, it
can be as large as $10^{-10}$ in the other, yielding the prospect of a signal
in planned experiments. Even with Abelian flavor symmetries, CP violation in
neutral kaon mixing is generally expected to yield naturalness bounds on the
masses of additional Higgs doublets of order 20 TeV. We prove that for all
models in our class, where the flavor symmetry forces $\bar{\theta}$ to vanish
at tree-level, the flavor-changing neutral currents are CP-conserving, yielding
model-dependent bounds from neutral meson mixing near 1 TeV. Mixing of the two
CP-even scalars gives corrections to the couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs state
to $\bar{t}t, \bar{b}b, \bar{c}c, \bar{\tau}\tau$ and $\bar{\mu} \mu$, giving
possible signals at high luminosity runs at LHC and at future colliders.
Furthermore, distinctive correlations between corrections in the various
channels can probe the underlying flavor symmetry.</p>
