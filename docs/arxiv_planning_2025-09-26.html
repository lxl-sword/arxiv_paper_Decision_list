<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-25 14:56:49</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that
generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework
extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie
group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and
rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support
reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory
information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a
distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy
information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and
shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative
policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under
kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control
software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink
protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and
indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and
smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation. The

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-25 14:54:23</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based
environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-25 14:11:59</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We investigate the gravitational-wave background predicted by a
two-scalar-field cosmological model that aims to unify primordial inflation
with the dark sector, namely late-time dark energy and dark matter, in a single
and self-consistent theoretical framework. The model is constructed from an
action inspired by several extensions of general relativity and string-inspired
scenarios and features a non-minimal interaction between the two scalar fields,
while both remain minimally coupled to gravity. In this context, we derive the
gravitational-wave energy spectrum over wavelengths ranging from today's Hubble
horizon to those at the end of inflation. We employ the continuous Bogoliubov
coefficient formalism, originally introduced to describe particle creation in
an expanding Universe, in analogy to the well-established mechanism of
gravitational particle production and, in particular, generalized to gravitons.
Using this method, which enables an accurate description of graviton creation
across all cosmological epochs, we find that inflation provides the dominant
gravitational-wave contribution, while subdominant features arise at the
inflation-radiation, radiation-matter, and matter-dark energy transitions,
i.e., epochs naturally encoded inside our scalar field picture. The resulting
energy density spectrum is thus compared with the sensitivity curves of the
planned next-generation ground- and space-based gravitational-wave
observatories. The comparison identifies frequency bands where the predicted
signal could be probed, providing those windows associated with potentially
detectable signals, bounded by our analyses. Consequences of our recipe are
thus compared with numerical outcomes and the corresponding physical properties
discussed in detail.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot
coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in
cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning
(TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and

demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component
localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision

reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable,
busbar, service plug, and three leaf-cell removals, the approach yields
substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline
under identical perception and task assignments: average end-effector path

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-25 09:24:45</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM

  segmentation of remotely sensed images</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Qinfeng Zhu, Han Li, Liang He, Lei Fan</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-25 09:01:36</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Graph neural networks have shown promising results in weather forecasting,
which is critical for human activity such as agriculture planning and extreme
weather preparation. However, most studies focus on finite and local areas for
training, overlooking the influence of broader areas and limiting their ability
to generalize effectively. Thus, in this work, we study global weather
forecasting that is irregularly distributed and dynamically varying in
practice, requiring the model to generalize to unobserved locations. To address
such challenges, we propose a general Mesh Interpolation Graph Network (MIGN)
that models the irregular weather station forecasting, consisting of two key
designs: (1) learning spatially irregular data with regular mesh interpolation
network to align the data; (2) leveraging parametric spherical harmonics
location embedding to further enhance spatial generalization ability. Extensive
experiments on an up-to-date observation dataset show that MIGN significantly
outperforms existing data-driven models. Besides, we show that MIGN has spatial
generalization ability, and is capable of generalizing to previous unseen

<p class='card-text'>Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for
end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their
current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A
critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor
generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving
experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive
decision-making.
  MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that
combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits.
This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its
environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the
help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new
benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously
evaluate zero-shot generalization.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach.
On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an
exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art
performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\%
and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new
Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen

MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more

<p class='card-text'>Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-24 19:42:49</h6>
<p class='card-text'>For robots to operate autonomously in densely cluttered environments, they
must reason about and potentially physically interact with obstacles to clear a
path. Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered
staircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot
that pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable
stance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,
such as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be
difficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that
addresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal
robot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during
manipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled
perception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason
about feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core
contribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses
proprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an
object's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the
perception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,
closing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even
after partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from
physical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to
it being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston
Dynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher
task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared
to open-loop baselines.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The lack of RR Lyr stars in binary systems is an atypical fact when we
compared it to other classes of variables. Therefore, it has become a challenge
for observers to detect an RR Lyr variable in a binary system. The RR Lyr
variable KIC 2831097 was one of the most promising candidates. The phases of
maximum brightness in the Kepler photometry showed a regular variation
superimposed on a parabolic trend. These variations in the times of maximum
brightness (Tmax ) were interpreted as a possible light-time travel effect
(LTTE) in a wide binary and a fast evolutionary change in the period. We
planned two spectroscopic runs with the FIES instrument mounted at the NOT to
test the hypothesis of binarity. The observations were programmed at the
predicted quadratures of the orbit. The GEOS collaboration complemented the
spectroscopic survey by a photometric one. We also analysed Gaia time series
and intensive TESS photometry. The RV curves obtained at the quadratures show
the same mean RV (-203 km/s), which rules the possibility of an LTTE out. KIC
2831097 is a single high-velocity metal-poor RRc star belonging to the Galactic
halo. We revisited Kepler photometry and detected a weak Blazhko effect
consisting of an oscillation of only 1.1% of the period in about 50 d. We also
analysed the TESS photometry of Kepler-1601, whose photometry is contaminated
by KIC 2831097. In total, we collected 3624 times of maximum brightness. Linear
ephemerides cannot fit the whole dataset, but only parts of them. The period
shows a tendency to decrease in value, as if it were an evolutionary effect,
but not at a constant rate.</p>

instruct) and multiple optimization algorithms (DPO, PPO, and GRPO), RLMT
consistently outperforms standard RLHF pipelines. This includes substantial
gains of 3-7 points on three chat benchmarks (AlpacaEval2, WildBench, and
ArenaHardV2), along with 1-3 point improvements on other tasks like creative
writing and general knowledge. Our best 8B model surpasses GPT-4o in chat and
creative writing and rivals Claude-3.7-Sonnet (Thinking). RLMT can also be
applied directly to base models without an SFT stage, akin to R1-Zero training.
Remarkably, with only 7K prompts, Llama-3.1-8B base trained with our RLMT
recipe outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct post-trained with a complex
multi-staged pipeline with 25M+ examples. We close with qualitative and
quantitative analyses of how trained models plan their responses. Our results

<p class='card-text'>Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate
urban congestion and transportation challenges. Nevertheless, the noise
generated by eVTOL aircrafts poses a significant barrier to public acceptance
and regulatory approval, potentially limiting the operational scope and
scalability of UAM systems. Hence, the successful adoption of UAM systems
hinges on the ability to predict generated noise levels, and further develop
motion planning strategies that comply with community-level noise regulations
while maintaining operational efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a
novel noise-aware motion planning framework for UAM systems that ensures
compliance with noise regulations. We first develop a certifiable neural
network model to accurately predict eVTOL noise propagation patterns in urban
environments, providing provable bounds on its correctness. To achieve a
desired level of accuracy, we propose an active sampling strategy to
efficiently build the dataset used to train and test the noise model. Next, we
develop a noise-aware motion planning algorithm that utilizes the noise model
to generate eVTOL trajectories that guarantee compliance with community noise
regulations. The algorithm exploits the monotonic structure of the noise model
to efficiently sample the configuration space, ensuring that the generated
trajectories are both noise-compliant and operationally efficient. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through a number of
experiments for Vahana eVTOLs. The results show that the framework can generate
noise-compliant flight plans for a fleet of eVTOLs that adhere to community
noise regulations while optimizing operational efficiency.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-24 16:19:18</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Learning visuomotor policies from expert demonstrations is an important
frontier in modern robotics research, however, most popular methods require
copious efforts for collecting teleoperation data and struggle to generalize
out-ofdistribution. Scaling data collection has been explored through
leveraging human videos, as well as demonstration augmentation techniques. The
latter approach typically requires expensive simulation rollouts and trains
policies with synthetic image data, therefore introducing a sim-to-real gap. In
parallel, alternative state representations such as keypoints have shown great
promise for category-level generalization. In this work, we bring these avenues
together in a unified framework: PAD (Parse-AugmentDistill), for learning
generalizable bimanual policies from a single human video. Our method relies on
three steps: (a) parsing a human video demo into a robot-executable
keypoint-action trajectory, (b) employing bimanual task-and-motion-planning to
augment the demonstration at scale without simulators, and (c) distilling the
augmented trajectories into a keypoint-conditioned policy. Empirically, we
showcase that PAD outperforms state-ofthe-art bimanual demonstration
augmentation works relying on image policies with simulation rollouts, both in
terms of success rate and sample/cost efficiency. We deploy our framework in
six diverse real-world bimanual tasks such as pouring drinks, cleaning trash
and opening containers, producing one-shot policies that generalize in unseen
spatial arrangements, object instances and background distractors.

<p class='card-text'>Agentic AI is rapidly advancing in healthcare and biomedical research.
However, in medical image analysis, their performance and adoption remain
limited due to the lack of a robust ecosystem, insufficient toolsets, and the
absence of real-time interactive expert feedback. Here we present "TissueLab",
a co-evolving agentic AI system that allows researchers to ask direct
questions, automatically plan and generate explainable workflows, and conduct
real-time analyses where experts can visualize intermediate results and refine
them. TissueLab integrates tool factories across pathology, radiology, and
spatial omics domains. By standardizing inputs, outputs, and capabilities of
diverse tools, the system determines when and how to invoke them to address
research and clinical questions. Across diverse tasks with clinically
meaningful quantifications that inform staging, prognosis, and treatment
planning, TissueLab achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with
end-to-end vision-language models (VLMs) and other agentic AI systems such as

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-24 15:38:41</h6>
<p class='card-text'>End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in
autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the
generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a
framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy
to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models.
Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a
rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two
complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set
of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in
real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features.
The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a
distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This
anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse,
high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that
AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong gen?eralizability</p>

<p class='card-text'>Large-scale terrain scans are the basis for many important tasks, such as
topographic mapping, forestry, agriculture, and infrastructure planning. The
resulting point cloud data sets are so massive in size that even basic tasks
like viewing take hours to days of pre-processing in order to create
level-of-detail structures that allow inspecting the data set in their entirety
in real time. In this paper, we propose a method that is capable of instantly
visualizing massive country-sized scans with hundreds of billions of points.
Upon opening the data set, we first load a sparse subsample of points and
initialize an overview of the entire point cloud, immediately followed by a
surface reconstruction process to generate higher-quality, hole-free
heightmaps. As users start navigating towards a region of interest, we continue
to prioritize the heightmap construction process to the user's viewpoint. Once
a user zooms in closely, we load the full-resolution point cloud data for that
region and update the corresponding height map textures with the
full-resolution data. As users navigate elsewhere, full-resolution point data
that is no longer needed is unloaded, but the updated heightmap textures are
retained as a form of medium level of detail. Overall, our method constitutes a
form of direct out-of-core rendering for massive point cloud data sets
(terabytes, compressed) that requires no preprocessing and no additional disk

the U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework
first pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive
autoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency
regularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure
stable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a
reduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL

<p class='card-text'>End-to-End (E2E) solutions have emerged as a mainstream approach for
autonomous driving systems, with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
representing a new paradigm that leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge
from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and interact with complex
real-world environments. However, these methods remain constrained by the
limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode
physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex
rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely
limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires
computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges,
we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a
reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We
first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action
codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for
planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware
reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient
computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to
model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search
methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then
serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the
NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in
safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable
solution for autonomous driving systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>To enable robots to comprehend high-level human instructions and perform
complex tasks, a key challenge lies in achieving comprehensive scene
understanding: interpreting and interacting with the 3D environment in a
meaningful way. This requires a smart map that fuses accurate geometric
structure with rich, human-understandable semantics. To address this, we
introduce the 3D Queryable Scene Representation (3D QSR), a novel framework
built on multimedia data that unifies three complementary 3D representations:
(1) 3D-consistent novel view rendering and segmentation from panoptic
reconstruction, (2) precise geometry from 3D point clouds, and (3) structured,
scalable organization via 3D scene graphs. Built on an object-centric design,
the framework integrates with large vision-language models to enable semantic
queryability by linking multimodal object embeddings, and supporting
object-level retrieval of geometric, visual, and semantic information. The
retrieved data are then loaded into a robotic task planner for downstream
execution. We evaluate our approach through simulated robotic task planning
scenarios in Unity, guided by abstract language instructions and using the
indoor public dataset Replica. Furthermore, we apply it in a digital duplicate
of a real wet lab environment to test QSR-supported robotic task planning for
emergency response. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to
facilitate scene understanding and integrate spatial and semantic reasoning,
effectively translating high-level human instructions into precise robotic task

<p class='card-text'>This study presents FREDopt, a newly developed GPU-accelerated open-source
optimization software for simultaneous proton dose and dose-averaged LET (LETd)
optimization in IMPT treatment planning. FREDopt was implemented entirely in
Python, leveraging CuPy for GPU acceleration and incorporating fast Monte Carlo
(MC) simulations from the FRED code. The treatment plan optimization workflow
includes pre-optimization and optimization, the latter equipped with a novel
superiorization of feasibility-seeking algorithms. Feasibility-seeking requires
finding a point that satisfies prescribed constraints. Superiorization
interlaces computational perturbations into iterative feasibility-seeking steps
to steer them toward a superior feasible point, replacing the need for costly
full-fledged constrained optimization. The method was validated on two
treatment plans of patients treated in a clinical proton therapy center, with
dose and LETd distributions compared before and after reoptimization.
Simultaneous dose and LETd optimization using FREDopt led to a substantial
reduction of LETd and (dose)x(LETd) in organs at risk (OARs) while preserving
target dose conformity. Computational performance evaluation showed execution
times of 14-50 minutes, depending on the algorithm and target volume

<p class='card-text'>Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an
egocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability
to translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability,
however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where
mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather
than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene
Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates
multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then,
harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation,
we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic
supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like
attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with
human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like
perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a
Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality
contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates
the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple
abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from
visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more
nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate
OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over
ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently
achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception,
prediction, planning, and visual question answering.</p>

understand steps that can be taken to mitigate the impact of satellite
constellations on astronomical observations. At the time, just over 12,000
operational satellites were in low-Earth orbit (LEO). Although reflected
sunlight and emissions all across the electromagnetic spectrum from artificial
satellites impact scientific observations and the sky, the workshop focused on
reflected sunlight in the wavelength range 330 nm to 1100 nm. This aligns with
the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) planned
imaging observations over the coming decade. Among other conclusions, we affirm
previous recommendations that tracked satellite apparent magnitudes should be

<p class='card-text'>Planning collision free trajectories in complex environments remains a core
challenge in robotics. Existing corridor based planners which rely on
decomposition of the free space into collision free subsets scale poorly with
environmental complexity and require explicit allocations of time windows to
trajectory segments. We introduce a new trajectory parameterization that
represents trajectories in a nonconvex collision free corridor as being in a
convex cartesian product of balls. This parameterization allows us to decouple
problem size from geometric complexity of the solution and naturally avoids
explicit time allocation by allowing trajectories to evolve continuously inside
ellipsoidal corridors. Building on this representation, we formulate the
Orthogonal Trust Region Problem (Orth-TRP), a specialized convex program with
separable block constraints, and develop a solver that exploits this parallel
structure and the unique structure of each parallel subproblem for efficient
optimization. Experiments on a quadrotor trajectory planning benchmark show
that our approach produces smoother trajectories and lower runtimes than
state-of-the-art corridor based planners, especially in highly complicated
