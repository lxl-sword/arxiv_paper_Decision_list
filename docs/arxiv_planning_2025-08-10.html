<p class='card-text'>Ultra-High-Energy (UHE, E $>100$ TeV) gamma rays are one of the few channels
to search for and study Galactic PeVatrons. Among the most promising PeVatron
candidates are the many UHE gamma-ray sources that have recently been
identified on the Galactic Plane. Ground-based particle detectors see these
sources as extended rather than point-like, and current generation Imaging
Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) struggle to study them with effective
areas and background rejection that are suboptimal at UHE. A cost-efficient way
of constructing an array of IACTs explicitly designed for UHE sensitivity is to
sparsely separate many small telescopes. We have simulated, prototyped, and
twice deployed a pathfinder array that is instrumented with telescopes designed
by the Panoramic Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) team.
These 0.5-meter Fresnel lens telescopes are purpose-built for imaging optical
transients on nanosecond timescales and are equipped with a
$10^\circ\times10^\circ$ silicon photomultiplier camera. Three PANOSETI
telescopes were deployed twice in the same temporary configuration at Lick
Observatory in March and October 2024. Here we give a brief description of the
instrument and present a comparison of simulations with the data collected,
including an analysis of the Crab Nebula. We also report on the ongoing
deployment of PANOSETI telescopes for the Dark100 array that is planned to
operate for five years at Palomar Observatory.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Embodied AI benchmarks have advanced navigation, manipulation, and reasoning,
but most target complex humanoid agents or large-scale simulations that are far
from real-world deployment. In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode
capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic
and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that
systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning
tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world
applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible
benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning
scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service
robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic
arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes
manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess
generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task
completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To
support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic
strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between
low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed
for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

<p class='card-text'>Accurate and reliable energy time series prediction is of great significance
for power generation planning and allocation. At present, deep learning time
series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale
time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the
existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension
of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting.
The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature
extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2)
probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo
elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as
temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples
to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments
on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other
commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable
uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for
time series prediction in the energy field.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs

<p class='card-text'>End-to-end autonomous driving has been recently seen rapid development,
exerting a profound influence on both industry and academia. However, the
existing work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole
learning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits
the robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we
introduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous
driving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance
multi-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model
based on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its
diversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the
end-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance
the optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative
modeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate
interactions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and

<p class='card-text'>There has been rapid development in generative AI tools across the education
sector, which in turn is leading to increased adoption by teachers. However,
this raises concerns regarding the safety and age-appropriateness of the
AI-generated content that is being created for use in classrooms. This paper
explores Oak National Academy's approach to addressing these concerns within
the development of the UK Government's first publicly available generative AI
tool - our AI-powered lesson planning assistant (Aila). Aila is intended to
support teachers planning national curriculum-aligned lessons that are
appropriate for pupils aged 5-16 years. To mitigate safety risks associated
with AI-generated content we have implemented four key safety guardrails - (1)
prompt engineering to ensure AI outputs are generated within pedagogically
sound and curriculum-aligned parameters, (2) input threat detection to mitigate
attacks, (3) an Independent Asynchronous Content Moderation Agent (IACMA) to
assess outputs against predefined safety categories, and (4) taking a
human-in-the-loop approach, to encourage teachers to review generated content
before it is used in the classroom. Through our on-going evaluation of these
safety guardrails we have identified several challenges and opportunities to
take into account when implementing and testing safety guardrails. This paper
highlights ways to build more effective safety guardrails in generative AI
education tools including the on-going iteration and refinement of guardrails,
as well as enabling cross-sector collaboration through sharing both open-source

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-07 12:10:46</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Human teaching effort is a significant bottleneck for the broader
applicability of interactive imitation learning. To reduce the number of
required queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human
teacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations. However, during these
queries, the novice's planned actions are not utilized despite containing
valuable information, such as the novice's capabilities, as well as
corresponding uncertainty levels. To this end, we allow the novice to say: "I
plan to do this, but I am uncertain." We introduce the Active Skill-level Data
Aggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the
novice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating
threshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)
Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and
relabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized
Interactive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on
uncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components
balance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required
demonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to
changing domains. We validate the effectiveness of ASkDAgger through
language-conditioned manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world
environments. Code, data, and videos are available at

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-07 10:43:19</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In high-density environments where numerous autonomous agents move
simultaneously in a distributed manner, streamlining global flows to mitigate
local congestion is crucial to maintain overall navigation efficiency. This
paper introduces a novel path-planning problem, congestion mitigation path
planning (CMPP), which embeds congestion directly into the cost function,
defined by the usage of incoming edges along agents' paths. CMPP assigns a
flow-based multiplicative penalty to each vertex of a sparse graph, which grows
steeply where frequently-traversed paths intersect, capturing the intuition
that congestion intensifies where many agents enter the same area from
different directions. Minimizing the total cost yields a set of coarse-level,
time-independent routes that autonomous agents can follow while applying their
own local collision avoidance. We formulate the problem and develop two
solvers: (i) an exact mixed-integer nonlinear programming solver for small
instances, and (ii) a scalable two-layer search algorithm, A-CMTS, which
quickly finds suboptimal solutions for large-scale instances and iteratively
refines them toward the optimum. Empirical studies show that augmenting
state-of-the-art collision-avoidance planners with CMPP significantly reduces
local congestion and enhances system throughput in both discrete- and
continuous-space scenarios. These results indicate that CMPP improves the
performance of multi-agent systems in real-world applications such as logistics
and autonomous-vehicle operations.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic

exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively
acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both
representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world

<p class='card-text'>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-07 08:09:47</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The international standard ISO 2859-2 provides plans for acceptance sampling
by attributes, that ensure a defined quality level in isolated lots using the
hypergeometric distribution. In destructive testing, the sample itself is
damaged or changed such that the quality of an entire lot is less relevant than
the quality of the lot that remains after removing the sample. Examples include
assessing the germination of seeds and the conformity of in-service utility
meters.
  This research highlights that the hypergeometric distribution cannot describe
the frequentist consumer's risk of accepting a remaining lot with
unsatisfactory quality. Consequently, sampling plans as those provided in ISO
2859-2 are ill-suited to assess the remaining lot when sampling destructively.
In contrast, Bayesian statistics inherently infers the lot's quality after
sampling. Using a reference prior, we show that sampling plans provided by ISO
2859-2 result in high specific consumer's risk for small remaining lots.
  The ISO 2859-2 being ill-suited, we design plans for destructive sampling
that limit the (Bayesian) specific consumer's risk. To tabulate these plans in
a similar way to ISO 2859-2, we propose a new representation that fixes the
remaining lot size $N-n$ rather than the sample size $n$. This generalizable,
concise and efficient representation is suitable for future standardization of

<p class='card-text'>Generating high-quality motion plans for multiple robot arms is challenging
due to the high dimensionality of the system and the potential for inter-arm
collisions. Traditional motion planning methods often produce motions that are
suboptimal in terms of smoothness and execution time for multi-arm systems.
Post-processing via shortcutting is a common approach to improve motion quality
for efficient and smooth execution. However, in multi-arm scenarios, optimizing
one arm's motion must not introduce collisions with other arms. Although
existing multi-arm planning works often use some form of shortcutting
techniques, their exact methodology and impact on performance are often vaguely
described. In this work, we present a comprehensive study quantitatively
comparing existing shortcutting methods for multi-arm trajectories across
diverse simulated scenarios. We carefully analyze the pros and cons of each

  Notes</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Existing unstructured data analytics systems rely on experts to write code
and manage complex analysis workflows, making them both expensive and
time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticData, an
innovative agentic data analytics system that allows users to simply pose
natural language (NL) questions while autonomously analyzing data sources
across multiple domains, including both unstructured and structured data.
First, AgenticData employs a feedback-driven planning technique that
automatically converts an NL query into a semantic plan composed of relational
and semantic operators. We propose a multi-agent collaboration strategy by
utilizing a data profiling agent for discovering relevant data, a semantic
cross-validation agent for iterative optimization based on feedback, and a
smart memory agent for maintaining short-term context and long-term knowledge.
Second, we propose a semantic optimization model to refine and execute semantic
plans effectively. Our system, AgenticData, has been tested using three
benchmarks. Experimental results showed that AgenticData achieved superior
accuracy on both easy and difficult tasks, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods.</p>

  Navigation of Mobile Robots</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Wenjie Hu, Ye Zhou, Hann Woei Ho</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-07 03:06:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to
traverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze
navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and
long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and
average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG
(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The
high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate
subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The
low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates
primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal
assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with
off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical
experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to
improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is
employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including
gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve
robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical
simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and
Gazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze
navigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard
DDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and
boosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline
algorithms.</p>

  Using Hierarchical Cyclic Merging Regulation</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-07 02:27:32</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The double coverage problem focuses on determining efficient, collision-free
routes for multiple robots to simultaneously cover linear features (e.g.,
surface cracks or road routes) and survey areas (e.g., parking lots or local
regions) in known environments. In these problems, each robot carries two
functional roles: service (linear feature footprint coverage) and exploration
(complete area coverage). Service has a smaller operational footprint but
incurs higher costs (e.g., time) compared to exploration. We present optimal
planning algorithms for the double coverage problems using hierarchical cyclic
merging regulation (HCMR). To reduce the complexity for optimal planning
solutions, we analyze the manifold attachment process during graph traversal
from a Morse theory perspective. We show that solutions satisfying minimum path
length and collision-free constraints must belong to a Morse-bounded
collection. To identify this collection, we introduce the HCMR algorithm. In
HCMR, cyclic merging search regulates traversal behavior, while edge sequence
back propagation converts these regulations into graph edge traversal
sequences. Incorporating balanced partitioning, the optimal sequence is
selected to generate routes for each robot. We prove the optimality of the HCMR
algorithm under a fixed sweep direction. The multi-robot simulation results
demonstrate that the HCMR algorithm significantly improves planned path length
by at least 10.0%, reduces task time by at least 16.9% in average, and ensures
conflict-free operation compared to other state-of-the-art planning methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Traditional control and planning for robotic manipulation heavily rely on
precise physical models and predefined action sequences. While effective in
structured environments, such approaches often fail in real-world scenarios due
to modeling inaccuracies and struggle to generalize to novel tasks. In
contrast, humans intuitively interact with their surroundings, demonstrating
remarkable adaptability, making efficient decisions through implicit physical
understanding. In this work, we propose INTENTION, a novel framework enabling
robots with learned interactive intuition and autonomous manipulation in
diverse scenarios, by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based scene
reasoning with interaction-driven memory. We introduce Memory Graph to record
scenes from previous task interactions which embodies human-like understanding
and decision-making about different tasks in real world. Meanwhile, we design
an Intuitive Perceptor that extracts physical relations and affordances from
visual scenes. Together, these components empower robots to infer appropriate
interaction behaviors in new scenes without relying on repetitive instructions.

<p class='card-text'>Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as
the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought
management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While
recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,
have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in
hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize
across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective
mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a
framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological
episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an
external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant
patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and
predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and
mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on
real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework
yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study
highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves
the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in
ecosystem management. The code and data are available at

<p class='card-text'>Background: Lithium plays an important role in nuclear astrophysics, fusion
energy generation, and nuclear technology. From a theoretical point of view,
the nucleus $^7$Li presents a remarkable challenge, as its bound states and
resonances can be understood as being formed by a $^4$He and $^3$H pair, or
simultaneously, a single neutron/proton coupled to a $^6$Li/$^6$He core. In
light of this complexity, a consistent description of $^7$Li bound-state and
continuum properties in a unified model presents a significant advancement
towards a predictive theory of nuclear structure and reactions.
  Purpose: Towards achieving such a predictive description, we carry out
calculations for $^7$Li within an ab initio framework, taking into account the
mass/charge partitions $^6$Li + $n$ and $^6$He + $p$ in a single
coupled-channel calculation. This approach allows us to both investigate the
effects of the coupling between partitions on the spectrum of $^7$Li, and
calculate the cross sections for the $^6$Li($n,p)^6$He and $^6$He($p,n)^6$Li
reactions.
  Method: We use the no-core shell model with continuum, which is capable of
describing both bound and scattering states in a unified framework.
  Results: Our calculation reproduces all the experimentally observed states of
$^7$Li in the correct order and predicts new resonances. We also calculated the
cross section of the reaction $^6$He($p,n)^6$Li and differential cross sections
of the elastic scattering of protons on $^6$He to provide theoretical results
for comparison with planned experiments.
  Conclusions: The overall shape of the cross section of the reaction
$^6$Li$(n,p)^6$He as a function of energy is reproduced, although the absolute
magnitude is overestimated due to omission of the ($n,\alpha$) reaction
channel. A more accurate description of the cross section is achieved by
phenomenological adjustmenting the energies of resonances.</p>

<p class='card-text'>As hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) gain traction in heavy-duty trucks,
adaptive and efficient energy management is critical for reducing fuel
consumption while maintaining battery charge for long operation times. We
present a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on the Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize engine control in series HEVs. We
reformulate the control task as a sequential decision-making problem and
enhance SAC by incorporating Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Decision
Transformers (DTs) into both actor and critic networks to capture temporal
dependencies and improve planning over time. To evaluate robustness and
generalization, we train the models under diverse initial battery states, drive
cycle durations, power demands, and input sequence lengths. Experiments show
that the SAC agent with a DT-based actor and GRU-based critic was within 1.8%
of Dynamic Programming (DP) in fuel savings on the Highway Fuel Economy Test
(HFET) cycle, while the SAC agent with GRUs in both actor and critic networks,
and FFN actor-critic agent were within 3.16% and 3.43%, respectively. On unseen
drive cycles (US06 and Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck (HHDDT) cruise segment),
generalized sequence-aware agents consistently outperformed feedforward network

<p class='card-text'>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) requires computing collision-free paths for
multiple agents in shared environment. Most MAPF planners assume that each
agent reaches a specific location at a specific timestep, but this is
infeasible to directly follow on real systems where delays often occur. To
address collisions caused by agents deviating due to delays, the Temporal Plan
Graph (TPG) was proposed, which converts a MAPF time dependent solution into a
time independent set of inter-agent dependencies. Recently, a Bidirectional TPG
(BTPG) was proposed which relaxed some dependencies into ``bidirectional pairs"
and improved efficiency of agents executing their MAPF solution with delays.
Our work improves upon this prior work by designing an algorithm, BPTG-max,
that finds more bidirectional pairs. Our main theoretical contribution is in
designing the BTPG-max algorithm is locally optimal, i.e. which constructs a
BTPG where no additional bidirectional pairs can be added. We also show how in
practice BTPG-max leads to BTPGs with significantly more bidirectional edges,
superior anytime behavior, and improves robustness to delays.</p>

<p class='card-text'>As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the
development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its
substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that
represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac
morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be
used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.
electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though
deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great
advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain
shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data
distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known
at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that
utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.
Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at
test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques
to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart
segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the
best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best
performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With
93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR

<p class='card-text'>We address the challenge of multi-robot autonomous hazard mapping in
high-risk, failure-prone, communication-denied environments such as
post-disaster zones, underground mines, caves, and planetary surfaces. In these
missions, robots must explore and map hazards while minimizing the risk of
failure due to environmental threats or hardware limitations. We introduce a
behavior-adaptive, information-theoretic planning framework for multi-robot
teams grounded in the concept of Behavioral Entropy (BE), that generalizes
Shannon entropy (SE) to capture diverse human-like uncertainty evaluations.
Building on this formulation, we propose the Behavior-Adaptive Path Planning
(BAPP) framework, which modulates information gathering strategies via a
tunable risk-sensitivity parameter, and present two planning algorithms:
BAPP-TID for intelligent triggering of high-fidelity robots, and BAPP-SIG for
safe deployment under high risk. We provide theoretical insights on the
informativeness of the proposed BAPP framework and validate its effectiveness
through both single-robot and multi-robot simulations. Our results show that
the BAPP stack consistently outperforms Shannon-based and random strategies:
BAPP-TID accelerates entropy reduction, while BAPP-SIG improves robot
survivability with minimal loss in information gain. In multi-agent
deployments, BAPP scales effectively through spatial partitioning, mobile base
relocation, and role-aware heterogeneity. These findings underscore the value
of behavior-adaptive planning for robust, risk-sensitive exploration in
complex, failure-prone environments.</p>
