<p class='card-text'>LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>As climate change intensifies extreme weather events, water disasters pose
growing threats to global communities, making adaptive reservoir management
critical for protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring water security.
Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading
uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These
uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental
variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons
downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional
centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational
complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while
existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve
effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we
present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by
starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment,
separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs
to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In
addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to
adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on
real-world USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\%,
cuts computation by 35\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\%, exhibiting
super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000
nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and
protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) optimizes strategic interactions in
non-cooperative dynamic games, where agents have misaligned objectives.
However, data-driven methods such as multi-agent policy gradients (MA-PG) often
suffer from instability and limit-cycle behaviors. Prior stabilization
techniques typically rely on entropy-based exploration, which slows learning
and increases variance. We propose a model-based approach that incorporates
approximate priors into the reward function as regularization. In linear
quadratic (LQ) games, we prove that such priors stabilize policy gradients and
guarantee local exponential convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium. We
then extend this idea to infinite-horizon nonlinear games by introducing
Multi-agent Guided Policy Search (MA-GPS), which constructs short-horizon local
LQ approximations from trajectories of current policies to guide training.
Experiments on nonlinear vehicle platooning and a six-player strategic
basketball formation show that MA-GPS achieves faster convergence and more
stable learning than existing MARL methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL),
where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to
model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL
(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness
to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to
suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can
promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,
are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual
representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that
interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value
functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking
evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem
for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic
risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic
algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative
benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves
coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a
theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in
MARL.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Co-optimizing safety and performance in large-scale multi-agent systems
remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches based on multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), safety filtering, or Model Predictive Control
(MPC) either lack strict safety guarantees, suffer from conservatism, or fail
to scale effectively. We propose MAD-PINN, a decentralized physics-informed
machine learning framework for solving the multi-agent state-constrained
optimal control problem (MASC-OCP). Our method leverages an epigraph-based
reformulation of SC-OCP to simultaneously capture performance and safety, and
approximates its solution via a physics-informed neural network. Scalability is
achieved by training the SC-OCP value function on reduced-agent systems and
deploying them in a decentralized fashion, where each agent relies only on
local observations of its neighbours for decision-making. To further enhance
safety and efficiency, we introduce an Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based
neighbour selection strategy to prioritize safety-critical interactions, and a
receding-horizon policy execution scheme that adapts to dynamic interactions
while reducing computational burden. Experiments on multi-agent navigation
tasks demonstrate that MAD-PINN achieves superior safety-performance
trade-offs, maintains scalability as the number of agents grows, and
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication
networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage
limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing
applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and
security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic
environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel
conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links
that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV
swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV
swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an
integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent
energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed
to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between
equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy
expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory
control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions
across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a
novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking
(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action
spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints
in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by
up to 25% compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central
challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response
Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing
full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs.
We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free
framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent
anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing
the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts,
multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB
oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within
the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the
need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of
Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn
Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster,
has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards
simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic
guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence
enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), each agent
selects a strategy, interacts with the environment and other agents, and
subsequently updates its strategy based on the received payoff. This process
generates a sequence of joint strategies $(s^t)_{t \geq 0}$, where $s^t$
represents the strategy profile of all agents at time step $t$. A widely
adopted principle in MARL algorithms is "win-stay, lose-shift", which dictates
that an agent retains its current strategy if it achieves the best response.
This principle exhibits a fixed-point property when the joint strategy has
become an equilibrium. The sequence of joint strategies under this principle is
referred to as a satisficing path, a concept first introduced in [40] and
explored in the context of $N$-player games in [39]. A fundamental question
arises regarding this principle: Under what conditions does every initial joint
strategy $s$ admit a finite-length satisficing path $(s^t)_{0 \leq t \leq T}$
where $s^0=s$ and $s^T$ is an equilibrium? This paper establishes a sufficient
condition for such a property, and demonstrates that any finite-state Markov
game, as well as any $N$-player game, guarantees the existence of a
finite-length satisficing path from an arbitrary initial strategy to some
equilibrium. These results provide a stronger theoretical foundation for the
design of MARL algorithms.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in
environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each
interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though
realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards
hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To
address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse
preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified
architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent
reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition
network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are
further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated
learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In
addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to
provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model.
Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state

framework that jointly learns an agent's control policy and its
event-triggering policy. Unlike prior work that decouples these mechanisms,
ET-MAPG integrates them into a unified learning process, enabling agents to
learn not only what action to take but also when to execute it. For scenarios

variant that leverages a self-attention mechanism to learn selective
communication patterns. AET-MAPG empowers agents to determine not only when to
trigger an action but also with whom to communicate and what information to

<p class='card-text'>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a growing research area which
gained significant traction in recent years, extending Deep RL applications to
a much wider range of problems. A particularly challenging class of problems in
this domain is Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HeMARL), where
agents with different sensors, resources, or capabilities must cooperate based
on local information. The large number of real-world situations involving
heterogeneous agents makes it an attractive research area, yet underexplored,
as most MARL research focuses on homogeneous agents (e.g., a swarm of identical
robots). In MARL and single-agent RL, standardized environments such as ALE and
SMAC have allowed to establish recognized benchmarks to measure progress.
However, there is a clear lack of such standardized testbed for cooperative
HeMARL. As a result, new research in this field often uses simple environments,
where most algorithms perform near optimally, or uses weakly heterogeneous MARL
environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cellular networks are increasingly realized through software-based entities,
with core functions deployed as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on
Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware. Network slicing has emerged as a key
enabler of 5G by providing logically isolated Quality of Service (QoS)
guarantees for diverse applications. With the adoption of cloud-native
infrastructures, the placement of network slices across heterogeneous
multi-cloud environments poses new challenges due to variable resource
capabilities and slice-specific requirements. This paper introduces a modular
framework for autonomous and near-optimal VNF placement based on a
disaggregated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach. The framework
incorporates real traffic profiles to estimate slice resource demands and
employs a MARL-based scheduler to minimize deployment cost while meeting QoS
constraints. Experimental evaluation on a multi-cloud testbed shows a 19x
speed-up compared to combinatorial optimization, with deployment costs within
7.8% of the optimal. While the method incurs up to 2.42x more QoS violations
under high load, the trade-off provides significantly faster decision-making
and reduced computational complexity. These results suggest that MARL-based
approaches offer a scalable and cost-efficient solution for real-time network

<p class='card-text'>The vision of 6G communication demands autonomous and resilient networking in
environments without fixed infrastructure. Yet most multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) approaches focus on isolated stages - exploration, relay
formation, or access - under static deployments and centralized control,
limiting adaptability. We propose the AI Agent Access (A\^3) Network, a
unified, embodied intelligence-driven framework that transforms multi-agent
networking into a dynamic, decentralized, and end-to-end system. Unlike prior
schemes, the A\^3 Network integrates exploration, target user access, and
backhaul maintenance within a single learning process, while supporting
on-demand agent addition during runtime. Its decentralized policies ensure that
even a single agent can operate independently with limited observations, while
coordinated agents achieve scalable, communication-optimized coverage. By
embedding link-level communication metrics into actor-critic learning, the A\^3
Network couples topology formation with robust decision-making. Numerical
simulations demonstrate that the A\^3 Network not only balances exploration and
communication efficiency but also delivers system-level adaptability absent in
existing MARL frameworks, offering a new paradigm for 6G multi-agent networks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Decentralized combinatorial optimization in evolving multi-agent systems
poses significant challenges, requiring agents to balance long-term
decision-making, short-term optimized collective outcomes, while preserving
autonomy of interactive agents under unanticipated changes. Reinforcement
learning offers a way to model sequential decision-making through dynamic
programming to anticipate future environmental changes. However, applying
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to decentralized combinatorial
optimization problems remains an open challenge due to the exponential growth
of the joint state-action space, high communication overhead, and privacy
concerns in centralized training. To address these limitations, this paper
proposes Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning (HRCL), a novel
approach that leverages both MARL and decentralized collective learning based
on a hierarchical framework. Agents take high-level strategies using MARL to
group possible plans for action space reduction and constrain the agent
behavior for Pareto optimality. Meanwhile, the low-level collective learning
layer ensures efficient and decentralized coordinated decisions among agents
with minimal communication. Extensive experiments in a synthetic scenario and
real-world smart city application models, including energy self-management and
drone swarm sensing, demonstrate that HRCL significantly improves performance,
scalability, and adaptability compared to the standalone MARL and collective
learning approaches, achieving a win-win synthesis solution.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Long Range (LoRa) based low-power wide area networks (LPWANs) are crucial for
enabling next-generation IoT (NG-IoT) applications in 5G/6G ecosystems due to
their long-range, low-power, and low-cost characteristics. However, achieving
high energy efficiency in such networks remains a critical challenge,
particularly in large-scale or dynamically changing environments. Traditional
terrestrial LoRa deployments often suffer from coverage gaps and
non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation losses, while satellite-based IoT
solutions consume excessive energy and introduce high latency, limiting their
suitability for energy-constrained and delay-sensitive applications. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel architecture using multiple unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying LoRa gateways to dynamically collect data from
ground-based LoRa end devices. Our approach aims to maximize the system's
weighted global energy efficiency by jointly optimizing spreading factors,
transmission powers, UAV trajectories, and end-device associations.
Additionally, we formulate this complex optimization problem as a partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose green LoRa multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (GLo-MAPPO), a multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) framework based on centralized training with decentralized execution
(CTDE). Simulation results show that GLo-MAPPO significantly outperforms
benchmark algorithms, achieving energy efficiency improvements of 71.25%,
18.56%, 67.00%, 59.73%, and 49.95% for networks with 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50

<p class='card-text'>Deep reinforcement learning has recently emerged as a promising feedback
control strategy for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs). When dealing with distributed, high-dimensional problems in
state and control variables, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been
proposed as a scalable approach for breaking the curse of dimensionality. In
particular, through decentralized training and execution, multiple agents
cooperate to steer the system towards a target configuration, relying solely on
local state and reward information. However, the principle of locality may
become a limiting factor whenever a collective, nonlocal behavior of the agents
is crucial to maximize the reward function, as typically happens in
PDE-constrained optimal control problems. In this work, we propose HypeMARL: a
decentralized MARL algorithm tailored to the control of high-dimensional,
parametric, and distributed systems. HypeMARL employs hypernetworks to
effectively parametrize the agents' policies and value functions with respect
to the system parameters and the agents' relative positions, encoded by
sinusoidal positional encoding. Through the application on challenging control
problems, such as density and flow control, we show that HypeMARL (i) can
effectively control systems through a collective behavior of the agents,
outperforming state-of-the-art decentralized MARL, (ii) can efficiently deal
with parametric dependencies, (iii) requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and
(iv) can reduce the amount of expensive environment interactions by a factor of
~10 thanks to its model-based extension, MB-HypeMARL, which relies on
computationally efficient deep learning-based surrogate models approximating
the dynamics locally, with minimal deterioration of the policy performance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In networked multi-agent reinforcement learning (Networked-MARL),
decentralized agents must act under local observability and constrained
communication over fixed physical graphs. Existing methods often assume static
neighborhoods, limiting adaptability to dynamic or heterogeneous environments.
While centralized frameworks can learn dynamic graphs, their reliance on global
state access and centralized infrastructure is impractical in real-world
decentralized systems. We propose a stochastic graph-based policy for
Networked-MARL, where each agent conditions its decision on a sampled subgraph
over its local physical neighborhood. Building on this formulation, we
introduce BayesG, a decentralized actor-framework that learns sparse,
context-aware interaction structures via Bayesian variational inference. Each
agent operates over an ego-graph and samples a latent communication mask to
guide message passing and policy computation. The variational distribution is
trained end-to-end alongside the policy using an evidence lower bound (ELBO)
objective, enabling agents to jointly learn both interaction topology and
decision-making strategies. BayesG outperforms strong MARL baselines on
large-scale traffic control tasks with up to 167 agents, demonstrating superior
scalability, efficiency, and performance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Routing-driven timely data collection in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks
(UASNs) is crucial for marine environmental monitoring, disaster warning and
underwater resource exploration, etc. However, harsh underwater conditions,
including high delays, limited bandwidth, and dynamic topologies - make
efficient routing decisions challenging in UASNs. In this paper, we propose a
smart interrupted routing scheme for UASNs to address dynamic underwater
challenges. We first model underwater noise influences from real underwater
routing features, e.g., turbulence and storms. We then propose a
Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based Interrupted Software-defined UASNs
Reinforcement Learning (ISURL) framework which ensures adaptive routing through
dynamically failure handling (e.g., energy depletion of sensor nodes or link
instability) and real-time interrupted recovery. Based on ISURL, we propose
MA-MAPPO algorithm, integrating multi-head attention mask mechanism with MAPPO
to filter out infeasible actions and streamline training. Furthermore, to
support interrupted data routing in UASNs, we introduce MA-MAPPO_i, MA-MAPPO
with interrupted policy, to enable smart interrupted routing decision in UASNs.
The evaluations demonstrate that our proposed routing scheme achieves exact
underwater data routing decision with faster convergence speed and lower

<p class='card-text'>Partial agent failure becomes inevitable when systems scale up, making it
crucial to identify the subset of agents whose compromise would most severely
degrade overall performance. In this paper, we study this Vulnerable Agent
Identification (VAI) problem in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL). We frame VAI as a Hierarchical Adversarial Decentralized Mean Field
Control (HAD-MFC), where the upper level involves an NP-hard combinatorial task
of selecting the most vulnerable agents, and the lower level learns worst-case
adversarial policies for these agents using mean-field MARL. The two problems
are coupled together, making HAD-MFC difficult to solve. To solve this, we
first decouple the hierarchical process by Fenchel-Rockafellar transform,
resulting a regularized mean-field Bellman operator for upper level that
enables independent learning at each level, thus reducing computational
complexity. We then reformulate the upper-level combinatorial problem as a MDP
with dense rewards from our regularized mean-field Bellman operator, enabling
us to sequentially identify the most vulnerable agents by greedy and RL
algorithms. This decomposition provably preserves the optimal solution of the
original HAD-MFC. Experiments show our method effectively identifies more
vulnerable agents in large-scale MARL and the rule-based system, fooling system
into worse failures, and learns a value function that reveals the vulnerability
of each agent.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) holds substantial promise for
intelligent decision-making in complex environments. However, it suffers from a
coordination and scalability bottleneck as the number of agents increases. To
address these issues, we propose the LLM-empowered expert demonstrations
framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (LEED). LEED consists of two
components: a demonstration generation (DG) module and a policy optimization
(PO) module. Specifically, the DG module leverages large language models to
generate instructions for interacting with the environment, thereby producing
high-quality demonstrations. The PO module adopts a decentralized training
paradigm, where each agent utilizes the generated demonstrations to construct
an expert policy loss, which is then integrated with its own policy loss. This
enables each agent to effectively personalize and optimize its local policy
based on both expert knowledge and individual experience. Experimental results
show that LEED achieves superior sample efficiency, time efficiency, and robust
scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major

simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures
often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration
rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address
these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural

permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers,
canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous

<p class='card-text'>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for
learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to
robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint
action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent
to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination
through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built
upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching
Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot
coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of
foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT
automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of
subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what
follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and
refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement

modeling complexity, alleviates the reliance on communication synchronization,
and enables the emergence of advanced cooperative behaviors through explicit

<p class='card-text'>In recent years, diversity has emerged as a useful mechanism to enhance the
efficiency of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing
methods predominantly focus on designing policies based on individual agent
characteristics, often neglecting the interplay and mutual influence among
agents during policy formation. To address this gap, we propose Competitive
Diversity through Constructive Conflict (CoDiCon), a novel approach that
incorporates competitive incentives into cooperative scenarios to encourage
policy exchange and foster strategic diversity among agents. Drawing
inspiration from sociological research, which highlights the benefits of
moderate competition and constructive conflict in group decision-making, we
design an intrinsic reward mechanism using ranking features to introduce
competitive motivations. A centralized intrinsic reward module generates and
distributes varying reward values to agents, ensuring an effective balance

centralized reward module to maximize environmental rewards, we reformulate the
constrained bilevel optimization problem to align with the original task

<p class='card-text'>When supersonic plasma flows collide, many physical processes contribute to
the morphology of the resulting shock. One of these processes is the
acceleration of non-thermal ions, which will, eventually, reach relativistic
speeds and become cosmic rays. This process is difficult to simulate in a
computer model because it requires both macro-physics (the overall shape of the
shock) and micro-physics (the interaction between individual particles and the
magnetic field). The combined PIC-MHD method is one of several options to get
around this problem. It is based on the assumption that a plasma can be
described as a combination of a thermal gas, which can be accurately described
as a fluid using grid-based magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and a small non-thermal
component which has to be described as individual particles using
particle-in-cell (PIC). By combining aspects of both methods, we reduce the
computational costs while maintaining the ability to trace the acceleration of
individual particles. We apply this method to a variety of astrophysical shock
configurations to investigate if, and how, they can contribute to the cosmic
