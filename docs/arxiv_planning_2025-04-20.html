<p class='card-text'>A robot navigating an outdoor environment with no prior knowledge of the
space must rely on its local sensing to perceive its surroundings and plan.
This can come in the form of a local metric map or local policy with some fixed
horizon. Beyond that, there is a fog of unknown space marked with some fixed
cost. A limited planning horizon can often result in myopic decisions leading
the robot off course or worse, into very difficult terrain. Ideally, we would
like the robot to have full knowledge that can be orders of magnitude larger
than a local cost map. In practice, this is intractable due to sparse sensing
information and often computationally expensive. In this work, we make a key
observation that long-range navigation only necessitates identifying good
frontier directions for planning instead of full map knowledge. To this end, we
propose Long Range Navigator (LRN), that learns an intermediate affordance
representation mapping high-dimensional camera images to `affordable' frontiers
for planning, and then optimizing for maximum alignment with the desired goal.
LRN notably is trained entirely on unlabeled ego-centric videos making it easy
to scale and adapt to new platforms. Through extensive off-road experiments on
Spot and a Big Vehicle, we find that augmenting existing navigation stacks with
LRN reduces human interventions at test-time and leads to faster decision
making indicating the relevance of LRN. https://personalrobotics.github.io/lrn</p>

<p class='card-text'>The "avoid - shift - improve" framework and the European Clean Vehicles
Directive set the path for improving the efficiency and ultimately
decarbonizing the transport sector. While electric buses have already been
adopted in several cities, regional bus lines may pose additional challenges
due to the potentially longer distances they have to travel. In this work, we
model and solve the electric bus scheduling problem, lexicographically
minimizing the size of the bus fleet, the number of charging stops, and the
total energy consumed, to provide decision support for bus operators planning
to replace their diesel-powered fleet with zero emission vehicles. We propose a
graph representation which allows partial charging without explicitly relying
on time variables and derive 3-index and 2-index mixed-integer linear
programming formulations for the multi-depot electric vehicle scheduling
problem. While the 3-index model can be solved by an off-the-shelf solver
directly, the 2-index model relies on an exponential number of constraints to
ensure the correct depot pairing. These are separated in a cutting plane
fashion. We propose a set of instances with up to 80 service trips to compare
the two approaches, showing that, with a small number of depots, the compact
3-index model performs very well. However, as the number of depots increases
the developed branch-and-cut algorithm proves to be of value. These findings
not only offer algorithmic insights but the developed approaches also provide
actionable guidance for transit agencies and operators, allowing to quantify
trade-offs between fleet size, energy efficiency, and infrastructure needs
under realistic operational conditions.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-17 11:20:29</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Achieving versatile and explosive motion with robustness against dynamic
uncertainties is a challenging task. Introducing parallel compliance in
quadrupedal design is deemed to enhance locomotion performance, which, however,
makes the control task even harder. This work aims to address this challenge by
proposing a general template model and establishing an efficient motion
planning and control pipeline. To start, we propose a reduced-order template
model-the dual-legged actuated spring-loaded inverted pendulum with trunk
rotation-which explicitly models parallel compliance by decoupling spring
effects from active motor actuation. With this template model, versatile
acrobatic motions, such as pronking, froggy jumping, and hop-turn, are
generated by a dual-layer trajectory optimization, where the singularity-free
body rotation representation is taken into consideration. Integrated with a
linear singularity-free tracking controller, enhanced quadrupedal locomotion is
achieved. Comparisons with the existing template model reveal the improved
accuracy and generalization of our model. Hardware experiments with a rigid
quadruped and a newly designed compliant quadruped demonstrate that i) the
template model enables generating versatile dynamic motion; ii) parallel
elasticity enhances explosive motion. For example, the maximal pronking
distance, hop-turn yaw angle, and froggy jumping distance increase at least by
25%, 15% and 25%, respectively; iii) parallel elasticity improves the
robustness against dynamic uncertainties, including modelling errors and
external disturbances. For example, the allowable support surface height
variation increases by 100% for robust froggy jumping.</p>

<p class='card-text'>End-to-end autonomous driving aims to produce planning trajectories from raw
sensors directly. Currently, most approaches integrate perception, prediction,
and planning modules into a fully differentiable network, promising great
scalability. However, these methods typically rely on deterministic modeling of
online maps in the perception module for guiding or constraining vehicle
planning, which may incorporate erroneous perception information and further
compromise planning safety. To address this issue, we delve into the importance
of online map uncertainty for enhancing autonomous driving safety and propose a
novel paradigm named UncAD. Specifically, UncAD first estimates the uncertainty
of the online map in the perception module. It then leverages the uncertainty
to guide motion prediction and planning modules to produce multi-modal
trajectories. Finally, to achieve safer autonomous driving, UncAD proposes an
uncertainty-collision-aware planning selection strategy according to the online
map uncertainty to evaluate and select the best trajectory. In this study, we
incorporate UncAD into various state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end methods.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that integrating UncAD, with only a
1.9% increase in parameters, can reduce collision rates by up to 26% and
drivable area conflict rate by up to 42%. Codes, pre-trained models, and demo

<p class='card-text'>Future planned lepton colliders, both in the circular and linear
configurations, can effectively work as virtual and quasi-real photon-photon
colliders and are expected to stimulate an intense physics program in the next
few years. In this paper, we suggest to consider photon-photon scattering as a
useful source of information on transverse momentum dependent fragmentation
functions (TMD FFs), complementing semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and
$e^+e^-$ annihilation processes, which provide most of the present
phenomenological information on TMD FFs. As a first illustrative example, we
study two-hadron azimuthal asymmetries around the jet thrust-axis in the
process $\ell^+\ell^-\to\gamma^* \gamma\to q\bar q\to h_1 h_2 + X$, in which in
a circular lepton collider one tagged, deeply-virtual photon scatters off an
untagged quasi-real photon, both originating from the initial lepton beams,
producing inclusively an almost back-to-back light-hadron pair with large
transverse momentum, in the $\gamma^*\gamma$ center of mass frame. Similar
processes, in a more complicated environment due to the presence of initial
hadronic states, can also be studied in ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC
and the planned future hadron colliders.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-17 09:46:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The Open Loop Layout Problem (OLLP) seeks to position rectangular cells of
varying dimensions on a plane without overlap, minimizing transportation costs
computed as the flow-weighted sum of pairwise distances between cells. A key
challenge in OLLP is to compute accurate inter-cell distances along feasible
paths that avoid rectangle intersections. Existing approaches approximate
inter-cell distances using centroids, a simplification that can ignore physical
constraints, resulting in infeasible layouts or underestimated distances. This
study proposes the first mathematical model that incorporates exact
door-to-door distances and feasible paths under the Euclidean metric, with cell
doors acting as pickup and delivery points. Feasible paths between doors must
either follow rectangle edges as corridors or take direct, unobstructed routes.
To address the NP-hardness of the problem, we present a metaheuristic framework
with a novel encoding scheme that embeds exact path calculations. Experiments
on standard benchmark instances confirm that our approach consistently
outperforms existing methods, delivering superior solution quality and

<p class='card-text'>In this work, we present a novel approach to bias the driving style of an
artificial race driver (ARD) for online time-optimal trajectory planning. Our
method leverages a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework that
combines time minimization with exit speed maximization at the end of the

trajectory planned in the previous MPC step, enabling ARD to adapt its driving
style from early to late apex maneuvers in real-time. Our approach is
computationally efficient, allowing for low replan times and long planning
horizons. We validate our method through simulations, comparing the results
against offline minimum-lap-time (MLT) optimal control and online minimum-time

<p class='card-text'>B* is a novel optimization framework that addresses a critical challenge in
fixed-base manipulator robotics: optimal base placement. Current methods rely
on pre-computed kinematics databases generated through sampling to search for
solutions. However, they face an inherent trade-off between solution optimality
and computational efficiency when determining sampling resolution. To address
these limitations, B* unifies multiple objectives without database dependence.
The framework employs a two-layer hierarchical approach. The outer layer
systematically manages terminal constraints through progressive tightening,
particularly for base mobility, enabling feasible initialization and broad
solution exploration. The inner layer addresses non-convexities in each
outer-layer subproblem through sequential local linearization, converting the
original problem into tractable sequential linear programming (SLP). Testing
across multiple robot platforms demonstrates B*'s effectiveness. The framework
achieves solution optimality five orders of magnitude better than
sampling-based approaches while maintaining perfect success rates and reduced
computational overhead. Operating directly in configuration space, B* enables
simultaneous path planning with customizable optimization criteria. B* serves
as a crucial initialization tool that bridges the gap between theoretical
motion planning and practical deployment, where feasible trajectory existence

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-17 05:52:35</h6>
<p class='card-text'>End-to-end autonomous driving has made impressive progress in recent years.
Former end-to-end autonomous driving approaches often decouple planning and
motion tasks, treating them as separate modules. This separation overlooks the
potential benefits that planning can gain from learning out-of-distribution
data encountered in motion tasks. However, unifying these tasks poses
significant challenges, such as constructing shared contextual representations
and handling the unobservability of other vehicles' states. To address these
challenges, we propose TTOG, a novel two-stage trajectory generation framework.
In the first stage, a diverse set of trajectory candidates is generated, while
the second stage focuses on refining these candidates through vehicle state
information. To mitigate the issue of unavailable surrounding vehicle states,
TTOG employs a self-vehicle data-trained state estimator, subsequently extended
to other vehicles. Furthermore, we introduce ECSA (equivariant context-sharing
scene adapter) to enhance the generalization of scene representations across
different agents. Experimental results demonstrate that TTOG achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both planning and motion tasks. Notably, on
the challenging open-loop nuScenes dataset, TTOG reduces the L2 distance by
36.06\%. Furthermore, on the closed-loop Bench2Drive dataset, our approach
achieves a 22\% improvement in the driving score (DS), significantly
outperforming existing baselines.</p>

<p class='card-text'>KAGRA is a kilometer-scale cryogenic gravitational-wave (GW) detector in
Japan. It joined the 4th joint observing run (O4) in May 2023 in collaboration
with the Laser Interferometer GW Observatory (LIGO) in the USA, and Virgo in
Italy. After one month of observations, KAGRA entered a break period to enhance
its sensitivity to GWs, and it is planned to rejoin O4 before its scheduled end
in October 2025. To accurately recover the information encoded in the GW
signals, it is essential to properly calibrate the observed signals. We employ
a photon calibration (Pcal) system as a reference signal injector to calibrate
the output signals obtained from the telescope. In ideal future conditions, the
uncertainty in Pcal could dominate the uncertainty in the observed data. In
this paper, we present the methods used to estimate the uncertainty in the Pcal
systems employed during KAGRA O4 and report an estimated system uncertainty of
0.79%, which is three times lower than the uncertainty achieved in the previous
3rd joint observing run (O3) in 2020. Additionally, we investigate the
uncertainty in the Pcal laser power sensors, which had the highest impact on
the Pcal uncertainty, and estimate the beam positions on the KAGRA main mirror,
which had the second highest impact. The Pcal systems in KAGRA are the first
fully functional calibration systems for a cryogenic GW telescope. To avoid
interference with the KAGRA cryogenic systems, the Pcal systems incorporate
unique features regarding their placement and the use of telephoto cameras,
which can capture images of the mirror surface at almost normal incidence. As
future GW telescopes, such as the Einstein Telescope, are expected to adopt
cryogenic techniques, the performance of the KAGRA Pcal systems can serve as a
valuable reference.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Safe and efficient path planning in parking scenarios presents a significant
challenge due to the presence of cluttered environments filled with static and

efficient planning strategy that seamlessly integrates the predictions of
dynamic obstacles into the planning process, ensuring the generation of
collision-free paths. Our approach builds upon the conventional Hybrid A star
algorithm by introducing a time-indexed variant that explicitly accounts for
the predictions of dynamic obstacles during node exploration in the graph, thus
enabling dynamic obstacle avoidance. We integrate the time-indexed Hybrid A
star algorithm within an online planning framework to compute local paths at
each planning step, guided by an adaptively chosen intermediate goal. The
proposed method is validated in diverse parking scenarios, including
perpendicular, angled, and parallel parking. Through simulations, we showcase
our approach's potential in greatly improving the efficiency and safety when

<p class='card-text'>Timely and accurate detection of hurricane debris is critical for effective
disaster response and community resilience. While post-disaster aerial imagery
is readily available, robust debris segmentation solutions applicable across
multiple disaster regions remain limited. Developing a generalized solution is
challenging due to varying environmental and imaging conditions that alter
debris' visual signatures across different regions, further compounded by the
scarcity of training data. This study addresses these challenges by fine-tuning
pre-trained foundational vision models, achieving robust performance with a
relatively small, high-quality dataset. Specifically, this work introduces an
open-source dataset comprising approximately 1,200 manually annotated aerial
RGB images from Hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Ike. To mitigate human biases and
enhance data quality, labels from multiple annotators are strategically
aggregated and visual prompt engineering is employed. The resulting fine-tuned
model, named fCLIPSeg, achieves a Dice score of 0.70 on data from Hurricane Ida
-- a disaster event entirely excluded during training -- with virtually no
false positives in debris-free areas. This work presents the first
event-agnostic debris segmentation model requiring only standard RGB imagery

<p class='card-text'>Generating natural and physically plausible character motion remains
challenging, particularly for long-horizon control with diverse guidance
signals. While prior work combines high-level diffusion-based motion planners
with low-level physics controllers, these systems suffer from domain gaps that
degrade motion quality and require task-specific fine-tuning. To tackle this
problem, we introduce UniPhys, a diffusion-based behavior cloning framework
that unifies motion planning and control into a single model. UniPhys enables
flexible, expressive character motion conditioned on multi-modal inputs such as
text, trajectories, and goals. To address accumulated prediction errors over
long sequences, UniPhys is trained with the Diffusion Forcing paradigm,
learning to denoise noisy motion histories and handle discrepancies introduced
by the physics simulator. This design allows UniPhys to robustly generate
physically plausible, long-horizon motions. Through guided sampling, UniPhys
generalizes to a wide range of control signals, including unseen ones, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments show that UniPhys outperforms
prior methods in motion naturalness, generalization, and robustness across

<p class='card-text'>Despite continuous advancements in cancer treatment, brain metastatic disease
remains a significant complication of primary cancer and is associated with an
unfavorable prognosis. One approach for improving diagnosis, management, and
outcomes is to implement algorithms based on artificial intelligence for the
automated segmentation of both pre- and post-treatment MRI brain images. Such
algorithms rely on volumetric criteria for lesion identification and treatment
response assessment, which are still not available in clinical practice.
Therefore, it is critical to establish tools for rapid volumetric segmentations
methods that can be translated to clinical practice and that are trained on
high quality annotated data. The BraTS-METS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge aims to
address this critical need by establishing inter-rater and intra-rater
variability in dataset annotation by generating high quality annotated datasets
from four individual instances of segmentation by neuroradiologists while being
recorded on video (two instances doing "from scratch" and two instances after
AI pre-segmentation). This high-quality annotated dataset will be used for
testing phase in 2025 Lighthouse challenge and will be publicly released at the
completion of the challenge. The 2025 Lighthouse challenge will also release
the 2023 and 2024 segmented datasets that were annotated using an established
pipeline of pre-segmentation, student annotation, two neuroradiologists
checking, and one neuroradiologist finalizing the process. It builds upon its
previous edition by including post-treatment cases in the dataset. Using these
high-quality annotated datasets, the 2025 Lighthouse challenge plans to test
benchmark algorithms for automated segmentation of pre-and post-treatment brain
metastases (BM), trained on diverse and multi-institutional datasets of MRI
images obtained from patients with brain metastases.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The Midwest, with its vast agricultural lands, is rapidly emerging as a key
region for utility-scale solar expansion. However, traditional power planning
has yet to integrate local economic impact directly into capacity expansion to
guide optimal siting decisions. Moreover, existing economic assessments tend to
emphasize local benefits while overlooking the opportunity costs of converting
productive farmland for solar development. This study addresses these gaps by
endogenously incorporating local economic metrics into a power system planning
model to evaluate how economic impacts influence solar siting, accounting for
the cost of lost agricultural output. We analyze all counties within the Great
Lakes region, constructing localized supply and marginal benefit curves that
are embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at
minimizing system costs and maximizing community economic benefits. Our
findings show that counties with larger economies and lower farmland
productivity deliver the highest local economic benefit per megawatt (MW) of
installed solar capacity. In Ohio, for example, large counties generate up to
$34,500 per MW, driven in part by high property tax revenues, while smaller
counties yield 31% less. Accounting for the opportunity cost of displaced
agricultural output reduces local benefits by up to 16%, depending on farmland
quality. A scenario prioritizing solar investment in counties with higher
economic returns increases total economic benefits by $1 billion (or 11%) by
2040, with solar investment shifting away from Michigan and Wisconsin (down by
39%) toward Ohio and Indiana (up by 75%), with only a marginal increase of 0.5%
in system-wide costs. These findings underscore the importance of integrating
economic considerations into utility-scale solar planning to better align
decarbonization goals with regional and local economic development.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We present the first results from the CAPERS survey, utilizing PRISM
observations with the JWST/NIRSpec MSA in the PRIMER-UDS field. With just 14 %
of the total planned data volume, we spectroscopically confirm two new bright
galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}\sim -20.4$) at redshifts $z = 10.562\pm0.034$ and $z =
11.013\pm0.028$. We examine their physical properties, morphologies, and star
formation histories, finding evidence for recent bursting star formation in at
least one galaxy thanks to the detection of strong (EW$_0\sim70$ A) H$\gamma$
emission. Combining our findings with previous studies of similarly bright
objects at high-$z$, we further assess the role of stochastic star formation
processes in shaping early galaxy populations. Our analysis finds that the
majority of bright ($M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -20$) spectroscopically-confirmed
galaxies at $z>10$ were likely observed during a starburst episode,
characterized by a median SFR$_{10}$/SFR$_{100}\sim2$, although with

galaxies are more preferentially in a bursting phase than similarly bright
$z\sim6$ galaxies. We finally discuss the prospects of deeper spectroscopic

quantify the true impact of bursting star formation on the evolution of the

<p class='card-text'>As generative AI tools like ChatGPT become integral to everyday writing,
critical questions arise about how to preserve writers' sense of agency and
ownership when using these tools. Yet, a systematic understanding of how AI
assistance affects different aspects of the writing process - and how this
shapes writers' agency - remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conducted a systematic review of 109 HCI papers using the PRISMA approach. From
this literature, we identify four overarching design strategies for AI writing
support: structured guidance, guided exploration, active co-writing, and
critical feedback - mapped across the four key cognitive processes in writing:
planning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. We complement this analysis
with interviews of 15 writers across diverse domains. Our findings reveal that
writers' desired levels of AI intervention vary across the writing process:
content-focused writers (e.g., academics) prioritize ownership during planning,
while form-focused writers (e.g., creatives) value control over translating and
reviewing. Writers' preferences are also shaped by contextual goals, values,
and notions of originality and authorship. By examining when ownership matters,
what writers want to own, and how AI interactions shape agency, we surface both

to unlock several remarkable applications in astrophysics, cosmology, and
nuclear physics through accurate measurements of the source luminosity distance

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-16 20:17:58</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper introduces the Frequency-Domain Differential Corrector (FDDC), a
model-agnostic approach for constructing quasi-periodic orbits (QPOs) across a
range of dynamical regimes. In contrast to existing methods that explicitly
enforce an invariance condition in all frequency dimensions, the FDDC targets
dominant spectral components identified through frequency-domain analysis.
Leveraging frequency refinement strategies such as Laskar-Numerical Analysis of
Fundamental Frequency (L-NAFF) and G\'omez-Mondelo-Sim\'o-Collocation (GMS-C),
the method enables efficient and scalable generation of high-dimensional QPOs.
The FDDC is demonstrated in both single- and multiple-shooting formulations.
While the study focuses on the Earth-Moon system, the framework is broadly
applicable to other celestial environments. Sample applications include Distant
Retrograde Orbits (DROs), Elliptical Lunar Frozen Orbits (ELFOs), and Near
Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs), illustrating constellation design and the
recovery of analog solutions in higher-fidelity models. With its
model-independent formulation and spectral targeting capabilities, FDDC offers
a versatile tool for robust trajectory design and mission planning in complex

<p class='card-text'>A highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) panzootic has severely impacted
wild bird populations worldwide, with documented (zoonotic) transmission to
mammals, including humans. Ongoing HPAI outbreaks on U.S. cattle farms have
raised concerns about potential spillover of virus from birds to cattle in
other countries, including Denmark. In the EU, the Bird Flu Radar tool,
coordinated by EFSA, monitors the spatio-temporal risk of HPAIV infection in
wild bird populations. A preparedness tool to assess the spillover risk to the
cattle industry is currently lacking, despite its critical importance. This
study aims to assess the temporal and spatial risk of HPAI virus (HPAIV)
spillover from wild birds, particularly waterfowl, into cattle populations in
Denmark. To support this assessment, a spillover transmission model is
developed by integrating two well-established surveillance tools, eBird and
Bird Flu Radar, in combination with global cattle density data. The generated
quantitative risk maps reveal the heterogeneous temporal and spatial
distribution of HPAIV spillover risk from wild birds to cattle across Denmark.
The highest risk periods are observed during calendar weeks 50 to 10. The
estimated total number of spillover cases nationwide is 1.93 (95% CI: 0.48,
4.98) in 2024, and 0.62 cases (95% CI: 0.15, 1.25) in 2025. These risk
estimates provide valuable insights to support veterinary contingency planning

<p class='card-text'>Detection of spatial areas where biodiversity is at risk is of paramount
importance for the conservation and monitoring of ecosystems. Large terrestrial
mammalian herbivores are keystone species as their activity not only has deep
effects on soils, plants, and animals, but also shapes landscapes, as large
herbivores act as allogenic ecosystem engineers. One key landscape feature that
indicates intense herbivore activity and potentially impacts biodiversity is
the formation of grazing trails. Grazing trails are formed by the continuous
trampling activity of large herbivores that can produce complex networks of
tracks of bare soil. Here, we evaluated different algorithms based on machine
learning techniques to identify grazing trails. Our goal is to automatically
detect potential areas with intense herbivory activity, which might be
beneficial for conservation and management plans.
  We have applied five semantic segmentation methods combined with fourteen
encoders aimed at mapping grazing trails on aerial images. Our results indicate
that in most cases the chosen methodology successfully mapped the trails,
although there were a few instances where the actual trail structure was
underestimated. The UNet architecture with the MambaOut encoder was the best
architecture for mapping trails. The proposed approach could be applied to
develop tools for mapping and monitoring temporal changes in these landscape
structures to support habitat conservation and land management programs. This
is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that competitive image
segmentation results are obtained for the detection and delineation of trails

<p class='card-text'>Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous vehicles often
assume a fixed vehicle model that remains constant regardless of the vehicle's
location. This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are
the two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay
with the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these
challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving
dynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to
autonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial
resolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing
adaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for
location-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased
safety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on
low storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework
proved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form.
Experiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In
future work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing
future interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions
in real-time.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Achieving reliable and safe autonomous driving in off-road environments
requires accurate and efficient terrain traversability analysis. However, this
task faces several challenges, including the scarcity of large-scale datasets
tailored for off-road scenarios, the high cost and potential errors of manual
annotation, the stringent real-time requirements of motion planning, and the
limited computational power of onboard units. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel traversability learning method that leverages
self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for manual annotation. For the
first time, a Birds-Eye View (BEV) representation is used as input, reducing
computational burden and improving adaptability to downstream motion planning.
During vehicle operation, the proposed method conducts online analysis of
traversed regions and dynamically updates prototypes to adaptively assess the
traversability of the current environment, effectively handling dynamic scene
changes. We evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art benchmarks on both
public datasets and our own dataset, covering diverse seasons and geographical
locations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms recent approaches. Additionally, real-world vehicle experiments
show that our method operates at 10 Hz, meeting real-time requirements, while a
5.5 km autonomous driving experiment further validates the generated
traversability cost maps compatibility with downstream motion planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The growing integration of robots in shared environments -- such as
warehouses, shopping centres, and hospitals -- demands a deep understanding of
the underlying dynamics and human behaviours, including how, when, and where
individuals engage in various activities and interactions. This knowledge goes
beyond simple correlation studies and requires a more comprehensive causal
analysis. By leveraging causal inference to model cause-and-effect
relationships, we can better anticipate critical environmental factors and
enable autonomous robots to plan and execute tasks more effectively. To this
end, we propose a novel causality-based decision-making framework that reasons
over a learned causal model to predict battery usage and human obstructions,
understanding how these factors could influence robot task execution. Such
reasoning framework assists the robot in deciding when and how to complete a
given task. To achieve this, we developed also PeopleFlow, a new Gazebo-based
simulator designed to model context-sensitive human-robot spatial interactions
in shared workspaces. PeopleFlow features realistic human and robot
trajectories influenced by contextual factors such as time, environment layout,
and robot state, and can simulate a large number of agents. While the simulator
is general-purpose, in this paper we focus on a warehouse-like environment as a
case study, where we conduct an extensive evaluation benchmarking our causal
approach against a non-causal baseline. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed solutions, highlighting how causal reasoning enables autonomous

solutions to Keller-Segel chemotaxis systems in the presence of laminar flows
and Kolmogorov flows with chaotic streamlines in three space dimensions. The
BDP outperforms two recent representative single-step flow matching and
diffusion models (rectified flow and shortcut diffusion models) in the
generative AI literature. However when the target distribution is
high-dimensional (4 and above), e.g. a mixture of two Gaussians, the
single-step diffusion models scale better in dimensions than BDP in terms of
W2-accuracy.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In this article, the candidate optimal paths for a Dubins vehicle on a sphere
are analytically derived. In particular, the arc angles for segments in $CGC$,
$CCC$, $CCCC$, and $CCCCC$ paths, which have previously been shown to be
optimal depending on the turning radius $r$ of the vehicle by Kumar \textit{et
al.}, are analytically derived. The derived expressions are used for the
implementation provided in
