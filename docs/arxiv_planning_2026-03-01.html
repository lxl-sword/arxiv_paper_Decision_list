<p class='card-text'>We propose a signal temporal logic (STL)-based framework that rigorously verifies the feasibility of a mission described in STL and synthesizes control to safely execute it. The proposed framework ensures safe and reliable operation through two phases. First, the proposed framework assesses the feasibility of STL by computing a backward reachable tube (BRT), which captures all states that can satisfy the given STL, regardless of the initial state. The proposed framework accommodates the multiple reach-avoid (MRA) problem to address more general STL specifications and leverages a deep neural network to alleviate the computation burden for reachability analysis, reducing the computation time by about 1000 times compared to a baseline method. We further propose a layered planning and control architecture that combines mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for global planning with model predictive control (MPC) as a local controller for the verified STL. Consequently, the proposed framework can robustly handle unexpected behavior of obstacles that are not described in the environment information or STL, thereby providing reliable mission performance. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully compute BRT for a given STL and perform the mission.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The accurate and automatic extraction of roads from satellite imagery is critical for applications in navigation and urban planning, significantly reducing the need for manual annotation. Many existing methods decompose this task into keypoint extraction and connectedness prediction, but often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex topologies. Here, we propose LineGraph2Road, a framework that improves connectedness prediction by formulating it as binary classification over edges in a constructed global but sparse Euclidean graph, where nodes are keypoints extracted from segmentation masks and edges connect node pairs within a predefined distance threshold, representing potential road segments. To better learn structural link representation, we transform the original graph into its corresponding line graph and apply a Graph Transformer on it for connectedness prediction. This formulation overcomes the limitations of endpoint-embedding fusion on set-isomorphic links, enabling rich link representations and effective relational reasoning over the global structure. Additionally, we introduce an overpass/underpass head to resolve multi-level crossings and a coupled NMS strategy to preserve critical connections. We evaluate LineGraph2Road on three benchmarks: City-scale, SpaceNet, and Global-scale, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on two key metrics, TOPO-F1 and APLS. It also captures fine visual details critical for real-world deployment. We will make our code publicly available.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Indicator-based approaches to machine consciousness recommend mechanism-linked evidence triangulated across tasks, supported by architectural inspection and causal intervention. Inspired by Humphrey's ipsundrum hypothesis, we implement ReCoN-Ipsundrum, an inspectable agent that extends a ReCoN state machine with a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience Ns and an optional affect proxy reporting valence/arousal. Across fixed-parameter ablations (ReCoN, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect), we operationalize Humphrey's qualiaphilia (preference for sensory experience for its own sake) as a familiarity-controlled scenic-over-dull route choice. We find a novelty dissociation: non-affect variants are novelty-sensitive (Delta scenic-entry = 0.07). Affect coupling is stable (Delta scenic-entry = 0.01) even when scenic is less novel (median Delta novelty ~ -0.43). In reward-free exploratory play, the affect variant shows structured local investigation (scan events 31.4 vs. 0.9; cycle score 7.6). In a pain-tail probe, only the affect variant sustains prolonged planned caution (tail duration 90 vs. 5). Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduces post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants (AUC drop 27.62, 27.9%) while leaving ReCoN unchanged. These dissociations link recurrence -> persistence and affect-coupled control -> preference stability, scanning, and lingering caution, illustrating how indicator-like signatures can be engineered and why mechanistic and causal evidence should accompany behavioral markers.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Real-world multimodal agents solve multi-step workflows grounded in visual evidence. For example, an agent can troubleshoot a device by linking a wiring photo to a schematic and validating the fix with online documentation, or plan a trip by interpreting a transit map and checking schedules under routing constraints. However, existing multimodal benchmarks mainly evaluate single-turn visual reasoning or specific tool skills, and they do not fully capture the realism, visual subtlety, and long-horizon tool use that practical agents require. We introduce AgentVista, a benchmark for generalist multimodal agents that spans 25 sub-domains across 7 categories, pairing realistic and detail-rich visual scenarios with natural hybrid tool use. Tasks require long-horizon tool interactions across modalities, including web search, image search, page navigation, and code-based operations for both image processing and general programming. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models exposes significant gaps in their ability to carry out long-horizon multimodal tool use. Even the best model in our evaluation, Gemini-3-Pro with tools, achieves only 27.3% overall accuracy, and hard instances can require more than 25 tool-calling turns. We expect AgentVista to accelerate the development of more capable and reliable multimodal agents for realistic and ultra-challenging problem solving.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Generalized planning studies the construction of solution strategies that generalize across families of planning problems sharing a common domain model, formally defined by a transition function $γ: S \times A \rightarrow S$. Classical approaches achieve such generalization through symbolic abstractions and explicit reasoning over $γ$. In contrast, recent Transformer-based planners, such as PlanGPT and Plansformer, largely cast generalized planning as direct action-sequence prediction, bypassing explicit transition modeling. While effective on in-distribution instances, these approaches typically require large datasets and model sizes, and often suffer from state drift in long-horizon settings due to the absence of explicit world-state evolution. In this work, we formulate generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem, in which a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function $\hatγ \approx γ$ and generates plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories. Instead of predicting actions directly, the model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states, thereby learning the domain dynamics as an implicit world model. To study size-invariant generalization and sample efficiency, we systematically evaluate multiple state representations and neural architectures, including relational graph encodings. Our results show that learning explicit transition models yields higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success than direct action-sequence prediction in multiple domains, while achieving these gains with significantly fewer training instances and smaller models. This is an extended version of a short paper accepted at ICAPS 2026 under the same title.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The sudden appearance of occluded pedestrians presents a critical safety challenge in autonomous driving. Conventional rule-based or purely data-driven approaches struggle with the inherent high uncertainty of these long-tail scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework grounded in Active Inference, which endows the agent with a human-like, belief-driven mechanism. Our framework leverages a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) to efficiently estimate the pedestrian's hybrid state. To emulate human-like cognitive processes under uncertainty, we introduce a Conditional Belief Reset mechanism and a Hypothesis Injection technique to explicitly model beliefs about the pedestrian's multiple latent intentions. Planning is achieved via a Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller, which synergizes the efficient, iterative search of CEM with the inherent robustness of MPPI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the collision rate compared to reactive, rule-based, and reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, while also exhibiting explainable and human-like driving behavior that reflects the agent's internal belief state.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Energy-based predictive world models provide a powerful approach for multi-step visual planning by reasoning over latent energy landscapes rather than generating pixels. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: (i) their latent representations are typically learned in Euclidean space, neglecting the underlying geometric and hierarchical structure among states, and (ii) they struggle with long-horizon prediction, which leads to rapid degradation across extended rollouts. To address these challenges, we introduce GeoWorld, a geometric world model that preserves geometric structure and hierarchical relations through a Hyperbolic JEPA, which maps latent representations from Euclidean space onto hyperbolic manifolds. We further introduce Geometric Reinforcement Learning for energy-based optimization, enabling stable multi-step planning in hyperbolic latent space. Extensive experiments on CrossTask and COIN demonstrate around 3% SR improvement in 3-step planning and 2% SR improvement in 4-step planning compared to the state-of-the-art V-JEPA 2.

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2026-02-26 12:30:44</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recent automated vehicle (AV) motion planning strategies evolve around minimizing risk in road traffic. However, they exclusively consider risk from the AV's perspective and, as such, do not address the ethicality of its decisions for other road users. We argue that this does not reduce the risk of each road user, as risk may be different from the perspective of each road user. Indeed, minimizing the risk from the AV's perspective may not imply that the risk from the perspective of other road users is also being minimized; in fact, it may even increase. To test this hypothesis, we propose an AV motion planning strategy that supports switching risk minimization strategies between all road user perspectives. We find that the risk from the perspective of other road users can generally be considered different to the risk from the AV's perspective. Taking a collective risk perspective, i.e., balancing the risks of all road users, we observe an AV that minimizes overall traffic risk the best, while putting itself at slightly higher risk for the benefit of others, which is consistent with human driving behavior. In addition, adopting a collective risk minimization strategy can also be beneficial to the AV's travel efficiency by acting assertively when other road users maintain a low risk estimate of the AV. Yet, the AV drives conservatively when its planned actions are less predictable to other road users, i.e., associated with high risk. We argue that such behavior is a form of self-reflection and a natural prerequisite for socially acceptable AV behavior. We conclude that to facilitate ethicality in road traffic that includes AVs, the risk-perspective of each road user must be considered in the decision-making of AVs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Presentation generation requires deep content research, coherent visual design, and iterative refinement based on observation. However, existing presentation agents often rely on predefined workflows and fixed templates. To address this, we present DeepPresenter, an agentic framework that adapts to diverse user intents, enables effective feedback-driven refinement, and generalizes beyond a scripted pipeline. Specifically, DeepPresenter autonomously plans, renders, and revises intermediate slide artifacts to support long-horizon refinement with environmental observations. Furthermore, rather than relying on self-reflection over internal signals (e.g., reasoning traces), our environment-grounded reflection conditions the generation process on perceptual artifact states (e.g., rendered slides), enabling the system to identify and correct presentation-specific issues during execution. Results on the evaluation set covering diverse presentation-generation scenarios show that DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance, and the fine-tuned 9B model remains highly competitive at substantially lower cost.

<p class='card-text'>With the recent fast development of generative models, instruction-based image editing has shown great potential in generating high-quality images. However, the quality of editing highly depends on carefully designed instructions, placing the burden of task decomposition and sequencing entirely on the user. To achieve autonomous image editing, we present PhotoAgent, a system that advances image editing through explicit aesthetic planning. Specifically, PhotoAgent formulates autonomous image editing as a long-horizon decision-making problem. It reasons over user aesthetic intent, plans multi-step editing actions via tree search, and iteratively refines results through closed-loop execution with memory and visual feedback, without requiring step-by-step user prompts. To support reliable evaluation in real-world scenarios, we introduce UGC-Edit, an aesthetic evaluation benchmark consisting of 7,000 photos and a learned aesthetic reward model. We also construct a test set containing 1,017 photos to systematically assess autonomous photo editing performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhotoAgent consistently improves both instruction adherence and visual quality compared with baseline methods.

<p class='card-text'>Diffusion models have become a popular choice for decision-making tasks in robotics, and more recently, are also being considered for solving autonomous driving tasks. However, their applications and evaluations in autonomous driving remain limited to simulation-based or laboratory settings. The full strength of diffusion models for large-scale, complex real-world settings, such as End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E AD), remains underexplored. In this study, we conducted a systematic and large-scale investigation to unleash the potential of the diffusion models as planners for E2E AD, based on a tremendous amount of real-vehicle data and road testing. Through comprehensive and carefully controlled studies, we identify key insights into the diffusion loss space, trajectory representation, and data scaling that significantly impact E2E planning performance. Moreover, we also provide an effective reinforcement learning post-training strategy to further enhance the safety of the learned planner. The resulting diffusion-based learning framework, Hyper Diffusion Planner} (HDP), is deployed on a real-vehicle platform and evaluated across 6 urban driving scenarios and 200 km of real-world testing, achieving a notable 10x performance improvement over the base model. Our work demonstrates that diffusion models, when properly designed and trained, can serve as effective and scalable E2E AD planners for complex, real-world autonomous driving tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Value decomposition (VD) methods have achieved remarkable success in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, their reliance on the max operator for temporal-difference (TD) target calculation leads to systematic Q-value overestimation. This issue is particularly severe in MARL due to the combinatorial explosion of the joint action space, which often results in unstable learning and suboptimal policies. To address this problem, we propose QSIM, a similarity weighted Q-learning framework that reconstructs the TD target using action similarity. Instead of using the greedy joint action directly, QSIM forms a similarity weighted expectation over a structured near-greedy joint action space. This formulation allows the target to integrate Q-values from diverse yet behaviorally related actions while assigning greater influence to those that are more similar to the greedy choice. By smoothing the target with structurally relevant alternatives, QSIM effectively mitigates overestimation and improves learning stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QSIM can be seamlessly integrated with various VD methods, consistently yielding superior performance and stability compared to the original algorithms. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that QSIM significantly mitigates the systematic value overestimation in MARL. Code is available at https://github.com/MaoMaoLYJ/pymarl-qsim.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We introduce SceneTransporter, an end-to-end framework for structured 3D scene generation from a single image. While existing methods generate part-level 3D objects, they often fail to organize these parts into distinct instances in open-world scenes. Through a debiased clustering probe, we reveal a critical insight: this failure stems from the lack of structural constraints within the model's internal assignment mechanism. Based on this finding, we reframe the task of structured 3D scene generation as a global correlation assignment problem. To solve this, SceneTransporter formulates and solves an entropic Optimal Transport (OT) objective within the denoising loop of the compositional DiT model. This formulation imposes two powerful structural constraints. First, the resulting transport plan gates cross-attention to enforce an exclusive, one-to-one routing of image patches to part-level 3D latents, preventing entanglement. Second, the competitive nature of the transport encourages the grouping of similar patches, a process that is further regularized by an edge-based cost, to form coherent objects and prevent fragmentation. Extensive experiments show that SceneTransporter outperforms existing methods on open-world scene generation, significantly improving instance-level coherence and geometric fidelity.

<p class='card-text'>We present a runtime efficient algorithm for autonomous helicopter landings on moving ship decks based on Shrinking-Horizon Model Predictive Control (SHMPC). First, a suitable planning model capturing the relevant aspects of the full nonlinear helicopter dynamics is derived. Next, we use the SHMPC together with a touchdown controller stage to ensure a pre-specified maneuver time and an associated landing time window despite the presence of disturbances. A high disturbance rejection performance is achieved by designing an ancillary controller with disturbance feedback. Thus, given a target position and time, a safe landing with suitable terminal conditions is be guaranteed if the initial optimization problem is feasible. The efficacy of our approach is shown in simulation where all maneuvers achieve a high landing precision in strong winds while satisfying timing and operational constraints with maximum computation times in the millisecond range.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous exploration in unknown environments is key for mobile robots, helping them perceive, map, and make decisions in complex areas. However, current methods often rely on frequent global optimization, suffering from high computational latency and trajectory oscillation, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, we propose SCOPE, a novel framework that incrementally constructs a real-time skeletal graph and introduces Implicit Unknown Region Analysis for efficient spatial reasoning. The planning layer adopts a hierarchical on-demand strategy: the Proximal Planner generates smooth, high-frequency local trajectories, while the Region-Sequence Planner is activated only when necessary to optimize global visitation order. Comparative evaluations in simulation demonstrate that SCOPE achieves competitive exploration performance comparable to state-of-the-art global planners, while reducing computational cost by an average of 86.9%. Real-world experiments further validate the system's robustness and low latency in practical scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image and video generation, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by the substantial computational overhead of multi-step iterative sampling. Among acceleration strategies, caching-based methods offer a training-free and effective solution by reusing or predicting features across timesteps. However, existing approaches rely on fixed or locally adaptive schedules without considering the global structure of the denoising trajectory, often leading to error accumulation and visual artifacts. To overcome this limitation, we propose DPCache, a novel training-free acceleration framework that formulates diffusion sampling acceleration as a global path planning problem. DPCache constructs a Path-Aware Cost Tensor from a small calibration set to quantify the path-dependent error of skipping timesteps conditioned on the preceding key timestep. Leveraging this tensor, DPCache employs dynamic programming to select an optimal sequence of key timesteps that minimizes the total path cost while preserving trajectory fidelity. During inference, the model performs full computations only at these key timesteps, while intermediate outputs are efficiently predicted using cached features. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that DPCache achieves strong acceleration with minimal quality loss, outperforming prior acceleration methods by $+$0.031 ImageReward at 4.87$\times$ speedup and even surpassing the full-step baseline by $+$0.028 ImageReward at 3.54$\times$ speedup on FLUX, validating the effectiveness of our path-aware global scheduling framework.

Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework that integrates generative planning with real-time control. The framework employs a high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints by effectively capturing historical context and temporal patterns. We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale offline datasets and through online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of AHBid, yielding a 13.57% increase in overall return compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Interactive Medical-SAM2 GUI is an open-source desktop application for semi-automatic annotation of 2D and 3D medical images. Built on the Napari multi-dimensional viewer, box/point prompting is integrated with SAM2-style propagation by treating a 3D volume as a slice sequence, enabling mask propagation from sparse prompts using Medical-SAM2 on top of SAM2. Voxel-level annotation remains essential for developing and validating medical imaging algorithms, yet manual labeling is slow and expensive for 3D scans, and existing integrations frequently emphasize per-slice interaction without providing a unified, cohort-oriented workflow for navigation, propagation, interactive correction, and quantitative export in a single local pipeline. To address this practical limitation, a local-first Napari workflow is provided for efficient 3D annotation across multiple studies using standard DICOM series and/or NIfTI volumes. Users can annotate cases sequentially under a single root folder with explicit proceed/skip actions, initialize objects via box-first prompting (including first/last-slice initialization for single-object propagation), refine predictions with point prompts, and finalize labels through prompt-first correction prior to saving. During export, per-object volumetry and 3D volume rendering are supported, and image geometry is preserved via SimpleITK. The GUI is implemented in Python using Napari and PyTorch, with optional N4 bias-field correction, and is intended exclusively for research annotation workflows. The code is released on the project page: https://github.com/SKKU-IBE/Medical-SAM2GUI/.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Robots are increasingly entering the daily lives of families, yet their successful integration into domestic life remains a challenge. We explore family routines as a critical entry point for understanding how robots might find a sustainable role in everyday family settings. Together with each of the ten families, we co-designed robot interactions and behaviors, and a plan for the robot to support their chosen routines, accounting for contextual factors such as timing, participants, locations, and the activities in the environment. We then designed, prototyped, and deployed a mobile social robot as a four-day, in-home user study. Families welcomed the robot's reminders, with parents especially appreciating the offloading of some reminding tasks. At the same time, interviews revealed tensions around timing, authority, and family dynamics, highlighting the complexity of integrating robots into households beyond the immediate task of reminders. Based on these insights, we offer design implications for robot-facilitated contextual reminders and discuss broader considerations for designing robots for family settings.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Editing images via instruction provides a natural way to generate interactive content, but it is a big challenge due to the higher requirement of scene understanding and generation. Prior work utilizes a chain of large language models, object segmentation models, and editing models for this task. However, the understanding models provide only a single modality ability, restricting the editing quality. We aim to bridge understanding and generation via a new multi-modality model that provides the intelligent abilities to instruction-based image editing models for more complex cases. To achieve this goal, we individually separate the instruction editing task with the multi-modality chain of thought prompts, i.e., Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning, editing region reasoning, and editing. For Chain-of-Thought planning, the large language model could reason the appropriate sub-prompts considering the instruction provided and the ability of the editing network. For editing region reasoning, we train an instruction-based editing region generation network with a multi-modal large language model. Finally, a hint-guided instruction-based editing network is proposed for editing image generations based on the sizeable text-to-image diffusion model to accept the hints for generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has competitive editing abilities on complex real-world images.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2026-02-26 00:54:38</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Pre-trained generative models for residential floor plans are typically optimized to fit large-scale data distributions, which can under-emphasize critical architectural priors such as the configurational dominance and connectivity of domestic public spaces (e.g., living rooms and foyers). This paper proposes Space Syntax-guided Post-training (SSPT), a post-training paradigm that explicitly injects space syntax knowledge into floor plan generation via a non-differentiable oracle. The oracle converts RPLAN-style layouts into rectangle-space graphs through greedy maximal-rectangle decomposition and door-mediated adjacency construction, and then computes integration-based measurements to quantify public space dominance and functional hierarchy.
  To enable consistent evaluation and diagnosis, we further introduce SSPT-Bench (Eval-8), an out-of-distribution benchmark that post-trains models using conditions capped at $\leq 7$ rooms while evaluating on 8-room programs, together with a unified metric suite for dominance, stability, and profile alignment. SSPT is instantiated with two strategies: (i) iterative retraining via space-syntax filtering and diffusion fine-tuning, and (ii) reinforcement learning via PPO with space-syntax rewards. Experiments show that both strategies improve public-space dominance and restore clearer functional hierarchy compared to distribution-fitted baselines, while PPO achieves stronger gains with substantially higher compute efficiency and reduced variance. SSPT provides a scalable pathway for integrating architectural theory into data-driven plan generation and is compatible with other generative backbones given a post-hoc evaluation oracle.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Floating-base multi-link robots can change their shape during flight, making them well-suited for applications in confined environments such as autonomous inspection and search and rescue. However, trajectory planning for such systems remains an open challenge because the problem lies in a high-dimensional, constraint-rich space where collision avoidance must be addressed together with kinematic limits and dynamic feasibility. This work introduces a hierarchical trajectory planning framework that integrates global guidance with configuration-aware local optimization. First, we exploit the dual nature of these robots - the root link as a rigid body for guidance and the articulated joints for flexibility - to generate global anchor states that decompose the planning problem into tractable segments. Second, we design a local trajectory planner that optimizes each segment in parallel with differentiable objectives and constraints, systematically enforcing kinematic feasibility and maintaining dynamic feasibility by avoiding control singularities. Third, we implement a complete system that directly processes point-cloud data, eliminating the need for handcrafted obstacle models. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments confirm that this framework enables an articulated aerial robot to exploit its morphology for maneuvering that rigid robots cannot achieve. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first planning framework for floating-base multi-link robots that has been demonstrated on a real robot to generate continuous, collision-free, and dynamically feasible trajectories directly from raw point-cloud inputs, without relying on handcrafted obstacle models.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), also known as ZeRO, is widely used for training large-scale models, featuring its flexibility and minimal intrusion on model code. However, current FSDP systems struggle with structure-aware training methods (e.g., block-wise quantized training) and with non-element-wise optimizers (e.g., Shampoo and Muon) used in cutting-edge models (e.g., Gemini, Kimi K2). FSDP's fixed element- or row-wise sharding formats conflict with the block-structured computations. In addition, today's implementations fall short in communication and memory efficiency, limiting scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs. We introduce veScale-FSDP, a redesigned FSDP system that couples a flexible sharding format, RaggedShard, with a structure-aware planning algorithm to deliver both flexibility and performance at scale. veScale-FSDP natively supports efficient data placement required by FSDP, empowering block-wise quantization and non-element-wise optimizers. As a result, veScale-FSDP achieves 5~66% higher throughput and 16~30% lower memory usage than existing FSDP systems, while scaling efficiently to tens of thousands of GPUs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Voice user interfaces (VUIs) are rapidly transitioning from accessibility features to mainstream interaction modalities. Yet most operating systems' built-in voice commands remain underutilized despite possessing robust technical capabilities. Through our analysis of four commercial VUI systems and a formative study with 16 participants, we found that fixed command formats require exact phrasing, restrictive timeout mechanisms discard input during planning pauses, and insufficient feedback hampers multi-step interactions. To address these challenges, we developed VoiceAlign, an adaptive shimming layer that mediates between users and legacy VUI systems. VoiceAlign intercepts natural voice commands, transforms them to match the required syntax using a large language model, and transmits these adapted commands through a virtual audio channel that remains transparent to the underlying system. In our evaluation with 12 participants, VoiceAlign reduced command failures by half, required 25% fewer commands per task, and significantly lowered cognitive and temporal demands when paired with an existing legacy VUI system. Furthermore, we created a synthetic dataset informed by our studies and fine-tuned a small language model that achieves over 90% accuracy with 200 ms response time when served locally, eliminating dependence on third-party APIs while enabling real-time interaction on edge devices. This work demonstrates how modern AI techniques can unlock the underutilized potential of legacy VUI systems without requiring system modifications, offering a practical solution without replacing existing infrastructure.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Plans often change due to changes in the situation or our understanding of the situation. Sometimes, a feasible plan may not even exist, and identifying such infeasibilities is useful to determine when requirements need adjustment. Common planning approaches focus on efficient one-shot planning in feasible cases rather than updating domains or detecting infeasibility. We propose a Petri net reachability relaxation to enable robust invariant synthesis, efficient goal-unreachability detection, and helpful infeasibility explanations. We further leverage incremental constraint solvers to support goal and constraint updates. Empirically, compared to baselines, our system produces a comparable number of invariants, detects up to 2 times more infeasibilities, performs competitively in one-shot planning, and outperforms in sequential plan updates in the tested domains.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Ego-centric driving videos available online provide an abundant source of visual data for autonomous driving, yet their lack of annotations makes it difficult to learn representations that capture both semantic structure and 3D geometry. Recent advances in large feedforward spatial models demonstrate that point maps and ego-motion can be inferred in a single forward pass, suggesting a promising direction for scalable driving perception. We therefore propose a label-free, teacher-guided framework for learning autonomous driving representations directly from unposed videos. Unlike prior self-supervised approaches that focus primarily on frame-to-frame consistency, we posit that safe and reactive driving depends critically on temporal context. To this end, we leverage a feedforward architecture equipped with a lightweight autoregressive module, trained using multi-modal supervisory signals that guide the model to jointly predict current and future point maps, camera poses, semantic segmentation, and motion masks. Multi-modal teachers provide sequence-level pseudo-supervision, enabling LFG to learn a unified pseudo-4D representation from raw YouTube videos without poses, labels, or LiDAR. The resulting encoder not only transfers effectively to downstream autonomous driving planning on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing multi-camera and LiDAR baselines with only a single monocular camera, but also yields strong performance when evaluated on a range of semantic, geometric, and qualitative motion prediction tasks. These geometry and motion-aware features position LFG as a compelling video-centric foundation model for autonomous driving.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper explains the Visual Milestone Planning (VMP) method using an agile vocabulary to facilitate its adoption by agile practitioners as a front end for a hybrid development process. VMP is a visual and collaborative planning approach which promotes a shared understanding of the work approach and commitment through the direct manipulation by team members of the reified planning constructs involved in the development of the plan. Once the product backlog has been established and relevant milestones identified, a novel construct called the milestone planning matrix is used to document the allocation of product backlog items to milestones. The milestones due dates are later determined by grouping sticky notes representing the work to be performed into time-boxes called work packages and accommodating them on a resource and time scaled scheduling canvas very much as it would be done in a Tetris game.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Medical images are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and research, but their quality is often degraded by noise from low-dose acquisition, patient motion, or scanner limitations, affecting both clinical interpretation and downstream analysis. Traditional filtering approaches often over-smooth and lose fine anatomical details, while deep learning methods, including CNNs, GANs, and transformers, may struggle to preserve such details or require large, computationally expensive models, limiting clinical practicality.
  We propose PatchDenoiser, a lightweight, energy-efficient multi-scale patch-based denoising framework. It decomposes denoising into local texture extraction and global context aggregation, fused via a spatially aware patch fusion strategy. This design enables effective noise suppression while preserving fine structural and anatomical details. PatchDenoiser is ultra-lightweight, with far fewer parameters and lower computational complexity than CNN-, GAN-, and transformer-based denoisers.
  On the 2016 Mayo Low-Dose CT dataset, PatchDenoiser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN- and GAN-based methods in PSNR and SSIM. It is robust to variations in slice thickness, reconstruction kernels, and HU windows, generalizes across scanners without fine-tuning, and reduces parameters by ~9x and energy consumption per inference by ~27x compared with conventional CNN denoisers.
  PatchDenoiser thus provides a practical, scalable, and computationally efficient solution for medical image denoising, balancing performance, robustness, and clinical deployability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In addition to the core tasks of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), active SLAM additionally in- volves generating robot actions that enable effective and efficient exploration of unknown environments. However, existing active SLAM pipelines are limited by three main factors. First, they inherit the restrictions of the underlying SLAM modules that they may be using. Second, their motion planning strategies are typically shortsighted and lack long-term vision. Third, most approaches struggle to handle dynamic scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel monocular active SLAM method, Dream-SLAM, which is based on dreaming cross-spatio-temporal images and semantically plausible structures of partially observed dynamic environments. The generated cross-spatio-temporal im- ages are fused with real observations to mitigate noise and data incompleteness, leading to more accurate camera pose estimation and a more coherent 3D scene representation. Furthermore, we integrate dreamed and observed scene structures to enable long- horizon planning, producing farsighted trajectories that promote efficient and thorough exploration. Extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that Dream-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy, mapping quality, and exploration efficiency.
