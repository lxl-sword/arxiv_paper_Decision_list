<p class='card-text'>The increasing availability of intraoral scanning devices has heightened
their importance in modern clinical orthodontics. Clinicians utilize advanced
Computer-Aided Design techniques to create patient-specific treatment plans
that include laboriously identifying crucial landmarks such as cusps,
mesial-distal locations, facial axis points, and tooth-gingiva boundaries.
Detecting such landmarks automatically presents challenges, including limited
dataset sizes, significant anatomical variability among subjects, and the
geometric nature of the data. We present our experiments from the 3DTeethLand
Grand Challenge at MICCAI 2024. Our method leverages recent advancements in
point cloud learning through transformer architectures. We designed a Point
Transformer v3 inspired module to capture meaningful geometric and anatomical
features, which are processed by a lightweight decoder to predict per-point
distances, further processed by graph-based non-minima suppression. We report
promising results and discuss insights on learned feature interpretability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The structure of causal language model training assumes that each token can
be accurately predicted from the previous context. This contrasts with humans'
natural writing and reasoning process, where goals are typically known before
the exact argument or phrasings. While this mismatch has been well studied in
the literature, the working assumption has been that architectural changes are
needed to address this mismatch. We argue that rearranging and processing the
training data sequences can allow models to more accurately imitate the true
data-generating process, and does not require any other changes to the
architecture or training infrastructure. We demonstrate that this technique,
Trelawney, and the inference algorithms derived from it allow us to improve
performance on several key benchmarks that span planning, algorithmic
reasoning, and story generation tasks. Finally, our method naturally enables
the generation of long-term goals at no additional cost. We investigate how
using the model's goal-generation capability can further improve planning and
reasoning. Additionally, we believe Trelawney could potentially open doors to
new capabilities beyond the current language modeling paradigm.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-15 13:11:47</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper introduces the Robotability Score ($R$), a novel metric that
quantifies the suitability of urban environments for autonomous robot
navigation. Through expert interviews and surveys, we identify and weigh key
features contributing to R for wheeled robots on urban streets. Our findings
reveal that pedestrian density, crowd dynamics and pedestrian flow are the most
critical factors, collectively accounting for 28% of the total score. Computing
robotability across New York City yields significant variation; the area of
highest R is 3.0 times more "robotable" than the area of lowest R. Deployments
of a physical robot on high and low robotability areas show the adequacy of the
score in anticipating the ease of robot navigation. This new framework for
evaluating urban landscapes aims to reduce uncertainty in robot deployment
while respecting established mobility patterns and urban planning principles,
contributing to the discourse on harmonious human-robot environments.</p>

problem. Up to authors' knowledge this is the first work addressing this
second-order quantitative stability estimate in general unbounded settings. Our
proof strategy relies on semiconcavity properties of entropic potentials and on
the representation of entropic transport plans as laws of forward and backward

allows to deduce a stochastic proof of quantitative stability entropic

for gradient and Hessian of Sinkhorn iterates along Sinkhorn's algorithm, a

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-15 11:16:09</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Online map construction is essential for autonomous robots to navigate in
unknown environments. However, the presence of dynamic objects may introduce
artifacts into the map, which can significantly degrade the performance of
localization and path planning. To tackle this problem, a novel online dynamic
object removal framework for static map construction based on conservative free
space estimation (FreeDOM) is proposed, consisting of a scan-removal front-end
and a map-refinement back-end. First, we propose a multi-resolution map
structure for fast computation and effective map representation. In the
scan-removal front-end, we employ raycast enhancement to improve free space
estimation and segment the LiDAR scan based on the estimated free space. In the
map-refinement back-end, we further eliminate residual dynamic objects in the
map by leveraging incremental free space information. As experimentally
verified on SemanticKITTI, HeLiMOS, and indoor datasets with various sensors,
our proposed framework overcomes the limitations of visibility-based methods
and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an average F1-score improvement
of 9.7%.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-15 08:00:46</h6>
<p class='card-text'>More than 10 billion tons of construction and demolition waste (CW) are
generated globally each year, exerting a significant impact on the environment.
In the CW recycling process, the government and the carrier are the two primary
stakeholders. The carrier is responsible for transporting CW from production
sites to backfill sites or processing facilities, with a primary focus on
transport efficiency and revenue. Meanwhile, the government aims to minimize
pollution from the recycling system, which is influenced by transport modes,
shipment distances, and the processing methods used for CW. This paper develops
a bi-objective, bi-level optimization model to address these challenges. The
upper-level model is a linear programming model that optimizes the government's
subsidy scheme, while the lower-level model is a minimum-cost flow model that
optimizes the carrier's recycling plan. A hybrid heuristic solution method is
proposed to tackle the problem's complexity. A case study in Chengdu, China,
demonstrates the computational efficiency of the model and its small solution
gap. With an optimized subsidy scheme and recycling plan, pollution can be
reduced by over 29.29% through a relatively small investment in subsidies.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-15 05:47:09</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Accurate rib fracture identification and classification are essential for
treatment planning. However, existing datasets often lack fine-grained
annotations, particularly regarding rib fracture characterization, type, and
precise anatomical location on individual ribs. To address this, we introduce a
novel rib fracture annotation protocol tailored for fracture classification.
Further, we enhance fracture classification by leveraging cross-modal
embeddings that bridge radiological images and clinical descriptions. Our
approach employs hyperbolic embeddings to capture the hierarchical nature of
fracture, mapping visual features and textual descriptions into a shared
non-Euclidean manifold. This framework enables more nuanced similarity
computations between imaging characteristics and clinical descriptions,
accounting for the inherent hierarchical relationships in fracture taxonomy.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods
across multiple classification tasks, with average recall improvements of 6% on
the AirRib dataset and 17.5% on the public RibFrac dataset.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The problem of finding a path between two points while avoiding obstacles is
critical in robotic path planning. We focus on the feasibility problem:
determining whether such a path exists. We model the robot as a query-specific
rectangular object capable of moving parallel to its sides. The obstacles are
axis-aligned, rectangular, and may overlap. Most previous works only consider
nondisjoint rectangular objects and point-sized or statically sized robots. Our
approach introduces a novel technique leveraging generalized Gabriel graphs and
constructs a data structure to facilitate online queries regarding path
feasibility with varying robot sizes in sublinear time. To efficiently handle
feasibility queries, we propose an online algorithm utilizing sweep line to
construct a generalized Gabriel graph under the $L_\infty$ norm, capturing key
gap constraints between obstacles. We utilize a persistent disjoint-set union
data structure to efficiently determine feasibility queries in
$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ total space.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Navigating in crowded environments requires the robot to be equipped with
high-level reasoning and planning techniques. Existing works focus on
developing complex and heavyweight planners while ignoring the role of human
intelligence. Since humans are highly capable agents who are also widely
available in a crowd navigation setting, we propose an alternative scheme where
the robot utilises people as planners to benefit from their effective planning
decisions and social behaviours. Through a set of rule-based evaluations, we
identify suitable human leaders who exhibit the potential to guide the robot
towards its goal. Using a simple base planner, the robot follows the selected
leader through shorthorizon subgoals that are designed to be straightforward to
achieve. We demonstrate through both simulated and real-world experiments that
our novel framework generates safe and efficient robot plans compared to
existing planners, even without predictive or data-driven modules. Our method
also brings human-like robot behaviours without explicitly defining traffic

<p class='card-text'>In this work, we leverage GPUs to construct probabilistically collision-free
convex sets in robot configuration space on the fly. This extends the use of
modern motion planning algorithms that leverage such representations to
changing environments. These planners rapidly and reliably optimize
high-quality trajectories, without the burden of challenging nonconvex
collision-avoidance constraints. We present an algorithm that inflates
collision-free piecewise linear paths into sequences of convex sets (SCS) that
are probabilistically collision-free using massive parallelism. We then
integrate this algorithm into a motion planning pipeline, which leverages
dynamic roadmaps to rapidly find one or multiple collision-free paths, and
inflates them. We then optimize the trajectory through the probabilistically
collision-free sets, simultaneously using the candidate trajectory to detect
and remove collisions from the sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach on a simulation benchmark and a KUKA iiwa 7 robot manipulator with

ability for forecasting system-wide vulnerability to catastrophic failures. Our
results reveal a systematic decline in the critical exponent from 1.45 in 2018

<p class='card-text'>Controllable scene generation could reduce the cost of diverse data
collection substantially for autonomous driving. Prior works formulate the
traffic layout generation as predictive progress, either by denoising entire
sequences at once or by iteratively predicting the next frame. However, full
sequence denoising hinders online reaction, while the latter's short-sighted
next-frame prediction lacks precise goal-state guidance. Further, the learned
model struggles to generate complex or challenging scenarios due to a large
number of safe and ordinal driving behaviors from open datasets. To overcome
these, we introduce Nexus, a decoupled scene generation framework that improves
reactivity and goal conditioning by simulating both ordinal and challenging
scenarios from fine-grained tokens with independent noise states. At the core
of the decoupled pipeline is the integration of a partial noise-masking
training strategy and a noise-aware schedule that ensures timely environmental
updates throughout the denoising process. To complement challenging scenario
generation, we collect a dataset consisting of complex corner cases. It covers
540 hours of simulated data, including high-risk interactions such as cut-in,
sudden braking, and collision. Nexus achieves superior generation realism while
preserving reactivity and goal orientation, with a 40% reduction in
displacement error. We further demonstrate that Nexus improves closed-loop
planning by 20% through data augmentation and showcase its capability in
safety-critical data generation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Layered control architectures have been a standard paradigm for efficiently
managing complex constrained systems. A typical architecture consists of: i) a
higher layer, where a low-frequency planner controls a simple model of the
system, and ii) a lower layer, where a high-frequency tracking controller
guides a detailed model of the system toward the output of the higher-layer
model. A fundamental problem in this layered architecture is the design of
planners and tracking controllers that guarantee both higher- and lower-layer
system constraints are satisfied. Toward addressing this problem, we introduce
a principled approach for layered multirate control of linear systems subject
to output and input constraints. Inspired by discrete-time simulation
functions, we propose a streamlined control design that guarantees the
lower-layer system tracks the output of the higher-layer system with computable
precision. Using this design, we derive conditions and present a method for
propagating the constraints of the lower-layer system to the higher-layer
system. The propagated constraints are integrated into the design of an
arbitrary planner that can handle higher-layer system constraints. Our
framework ensures that the output constraints of the lower-layer system are
satisfied at all high-level time steps, while respecting its input constraints
at all low-level time steps. We apply our approach in a scenario of motion

  variational quantum computing algorithm for faster IMPT</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Ya-Nan Zhu, Nimita Shinde, Bowen Lin, Hao Gao</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers superior dose conformity
with reduced exposure to surrounding healthy tissues compared to conventional
photon therapy. Improving IMPT delivery efficiency reduces motion-related
uncertainties, enhances plan robustness, and benefits breath-hold techniques by
shortening treatment time. Among various factors, energy switching time plays a
critical role, making energy layer optimization (ELO) essential. This work
develops an energy layer optimization method based on mixed integer model and
variational quantum computing algorithm to enhance the efficiency of IMPT. The
energy layer optimization problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program, where
continuous variables optimize the dose distribution and binary variables
indicate energy layer selection. To solve it, iterative convex relaxation
decouples the dose-volume constraints, followed by the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) to separate mixed-variable optimization and the
minimum monitor unit (MMU) constraint. The resulting beam intensity subproblem,
subject to MMU, either admits a closed-form solution or is efficiently solvable
via conjugate gradient. The binary subproblem is cast as a quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, solvable using variational
quantum computing algorithms. With nearly the same plan quality, the proposed
method noticeable reduces the number of the used energies. For example,
compared to conventional IMPT, QC can reduce the number of energy layers from
61 to 35 in HN case, from 56 to 35 in lung case, and from 59 to 32 to abdomen
case. The reduced number of energies also results in fewer delivery time, e.g.,
the delivery time is reduced from 100.6, 232.0, 185.3 seconds to 90.7, 215.4,
154.0 seconds, respectively.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Muons are elementary particles and provide cleaner collision events that can
explore higher energies compared to composite particles like protons. Muons are
also far heavier than their electron cousins, meaning that they emit less
synchrotron radiation that effectively limits the energies of circular
electron-positron colliders. These characteristics open up the possibility for
a Muon Collider to surpass the direct energy reach of the Large Hadron Collider
while achieving unprecedented precision measurements of Standard Model
processes. In this Essay, after briefly summarizing the progress achieved so
far, I identify important missing R&D steps and envision a compelling plan to
bring a Muon Collider to reality in the next two decades. A Muon Collider could
allow for the exploration of physics that is not available with current
technologies. For example, it may provide a way to study the Higgs boson
directly or probe new particles, including those related to dark matter or
other phenomena beyond the Standard Model.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The classical g-g diagram, representing the achievable acceleration space for
a vehicle, is commonly used as a constraint in trajectory planning and control
due to its computational simplicity. To address non-planar road geometries,
this concept can be extended to incorporate g-g constraints as a function of
vehicle speed and vertical acceleration, commonly referred to as g-g-g-v
diagrams. However, the estimation of g-g-g-v diagrams is an open problem.
Existing simulation-based approaches struggle to isolate non-transient,
open-loop stable states across all combinations of speed and acceleration,
while optimization-based methods often require simplified vehicle equations and
have potential convergence issues. In this paper, we present a novel,
open-source, quasi-steady-state black box simulation approach that applies a
virtual inertial force in the longitudinal direction. The method emulates the
load conditions associated with a specified longitudinal acceleration while
maintaining constant vehicle speed, enabling open-loop steering ramps in a
purely QSS manner. Appropriate regulation of the ramp steer rate inherently
mitigates transient vehicle dynamics when determining the maximum feasible
lateral acceleration. Moreover, treating the vehicle model as a black box
eliminates model mismatch issues, allowing the use of high-fidelity or
proprietary vehicle dynamics models typically unsuited for optimization
approaches. An open-source version of the proposed method is available at:

<p class='card-text'>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents offer cross-platform solutions for
automating complex digital tasks, with significant potential to transform
productivity workflows. However, their performance is often constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality trajectory data. To address this limitation, we
propose training Vision Language Models (VLMs) on data-rich,
reasoning-intensive tasks during a dedicated mid-training stage, and then
examine how incorporating these tasks facilitates generalization to GUI
planning scenarios. Specifically, we explore a range of tasks with readily
available instruction-tuning data, including GUI perception, multimodal
reasoning, and textual reasoning. Through extensive experiments across 11
mid-training tasks, we demonstrate that: (1) Task generalization proves highly
effective, yielding substantial improvements across most settings. For
instance, multimodal mathematical reasoning enhances performance on
AndroidWorld by an absolute 6.3%. Remarkably, text-only mathematical data
significantly boosts GUI web agent performance, achieving a 5.6% improvement on
WebArena and 5.4% improvement on AndroidWorld, underscoring notable cross-modal
generalization from text-based to visual domains; (2) Contrary to prior
assumptions, GUI perception data - previously considered closely aligned with
GUI agent tasks and widely utilized for training - has a comparatively limited
impact on final performance; (3) Building on these insights, we identify the
most effective mid-training tasks and curate optimized mixture datasets,
resulting in absolute performance gains of 8.0% on WebArena and 12.2% on
AndroidWorld. Our work provides valuable insights into cross-domain knowledge
transfer for GUI agents and offers a practical approach to addressing data
scarcity challenges in this emerging field. The code, data and models will be

<p class='card-text'>Rural economies are largely dependent upon agriculture, which is greatly
determined by climatic conditions such as rainfall. This study aims to forecast
agricultural production in Maharashtra, India, which utilises annual data from
the year 1962 to 2021. Since rainfall plays a major role with respect to the
crop yield, we analyze the impact of rainfall on crop yield using four time
series models that includes ARIMA, ARIMAX, GARCH-ARIMA and GARCH-ARIMAX. We
take advantage of rainfall as an external regressor to examine if it
contributes to the performance of the model. 1-step, 2-step, and 3-step ahead
forecasts are obtained and the model performance is assessed using MAE and
RMSE. The models are able to more accurately predict when using rainfall as a
predictor compared to when solely dependant on historical production trends
(more improved outcomes are seen in the ARIMAX and GARCH-ARIMAX models). As
such, these findings underscore the need for climate-aware forecasting
techniques that provide useful information to policymakers and farmers to aid
in agricultural planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Patterns are fundamental to human cognition, enabling the recognition of
structure and regularity across diverse domains. In this work, we focus on
structural repeats, patterns that arise from the repetition of hierarchical
relations within sequential data, and develop a candidate computational model
of how humans detect and understand such structural repeats. Based on a
weighted deduction system, our model infers the minimal generative process of a
given sequence in the form of a Template program, a formalism that enriches the
context-free grammar with repetition combinators. Such representation
efficiently encodes the repetition of sub-computations in a recursive manner.
As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the expressiveness of our model on short
sequences from music and action planning. The proposed model offers broader
insights into the mental representations and cognitive mechanisms underlying
human pattern recognition.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision impairment, making its
early diagnosis through fundus imaging critical for effective treatment
planning. However, the presence of poor quality fundus images caused by factors
such as inadequate illumination, noise, blurring and other motion artifacts
yields a significant challenge for accurate DR screening. In this study, we
propose progressive transfer learning for multi pass restoration to iteratively
enhance the quality of degraded fundus images, ensuring more reliable DR
screening. Unlike previous methods that often focus on a single pass
restoration, multi pass restoration via PTL can achieve a superior blind
restoration performance that can even improve most of the good quality fundus
images in the dataset. Initially, a Cycle GAN model is trained to restore low
quality images, followed by PTL induced restoration passes over the latest
restored outputs to improve overall quality in each pass. The proposed method
can learn blind restoration without requiring any paired data while surpassing
its limitations by leveraging progressive learning and fine tuning strategies
to minimize distortions and preserve critical retinal features. To evaluate
PTL's effectiveness on multi pass restoration, we conducted experiments on
DeepDRiD, a large scale fundus imaging dataset specifically curated for
diabetic retinopathy detection. Our result demonstrates state of the art
performance, showcasing PTL's potential as a superior approach to iterative
image quality restoration.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-14 09:06:02</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Visual navigation, a fundamental challenge in mobile robotics, demands
versatile policies to handle diverse environments. Classical methods leverage
geometric solutions to minimize specific costs, offering adaptability to new
scenarios but are prone to system errors due to their multi-modular design and
reliance on hand-crafted rules. Learning-based methods, while achieving high
planning success rates, face difficulties in generalizing to unseen
environments beyond the training data and often require extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the
strengths of learning-based methods and classical approaches for RGB-only
visual navigation. Our method first trains a conditional diffusion model on
diverse path-RGB observation pairs. During inference, it integrates the
gradients of differentiable scene-specific and task-level costs, guiding the
diffusion model to generate valid paths that meet the constraints. This
approach alleviates the need for retraining, offering a plug-and-play solution.
Extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor settings, across simulated and
real-world scenarios, demonstrate zero-shot transfer capability of our
approach, achieving higher success rates and fewer collisions compared to
baseline methods. Code will be released at

<p class='card-text'>Floor plans can provide valuable prior information that helps enhance the
accuracy of indoor positioning systems. However, existing research typically
faces challenges in efficiently leveraging floor plan information and applying
it to complex indoor layouts. To fully exploit information from floor plans for
positioning, we propose a floor plan-assisted fusion positioning algorithm
(FP-BP) using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR).
In the considered system, a user holding a smartphone walks through a
positioning area with BLE beacons installed on the ceiling, and can locate
himself in real time. In particular, FP-BP consists of two phases. In the
offline phase, FP-BP programmatically extracts map features from a stylized
floor plan based on their binary masks, and constructs a mapping function to
identify the corresponding map feature of any given position on the map. In the
online phase, FP-BP continuously computes BLE positions and PDR results from
BLE signals and smartphone sensors, where a novel grid-based maximum likelihood
estimation (GML) algorithm is introduced to enhance BLE positioning. Then, a
particle filter is used to fuse them and obtain an initial estimate. Finally,
FP-BP performs post-position correction to obtain the final position based on
its specific map feature. Experimental results show that FP-BP can achieve a
real-time mean positioning accuracy of 1.19 m, representing an improvement of
over 28% compared to existing floor plan-fused baseline algorithms.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-14 03:04:48</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We propose a novel control-theoretic framework that leverages principles from
generative modeling -- specifically, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
(DDPMs) -- to stabilize control-affine systems with nonholonomic constraints.
Unlike traditional stochastic approaches, which rely on noise-driven dynamics
in both forward and reverse processes, our method crucially eliminates the need
for noise in the reverse phase, making it particularly relevant for control
applications. We introduce two formulations: one where noise perturbs all state
dimensions during the forward phase while the control system enforces time
reversal deterministically, and another where noise is restricted to the
control channels, embedding system constraints directly into the forward
process.
  For controllable nonlinear drift-free systems, we prove that deterministic
feedback laws can exactly reverse the forward process, ensuring that the
system's probability density evolves correctly without requiring artificial
diffusion in the reverse phase. Furthermore, for linear time-invariant systems,
we establish a time-reversal result under the second formulation. By
eliminating noise in the backward process, our approach provides a more
practical alternative to machine learning-based denoising methods, which are
unsuitable for control applications due to the presence of stochasticity. We
validate our results through numerical simulations on benchmark systems,
including a unicycle model in a domain with obstacles, a driftless
five-dimensional system, and a four-dimensional linear system, demonstrating
the potential for applying diffusion-inspired techniques in linear, nonlinear,
