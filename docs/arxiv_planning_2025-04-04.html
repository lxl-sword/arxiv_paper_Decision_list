<p class='card-text'>Path planning and optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted
next-generation wireless networks is critical for mobility management and
ensuring UAV safety and ubiquitous connectivity, especially in dense urban
environments with street canyons and tall buildings. Traditional statistical
and model-based techniques have been successfully used for path optimization in
communication networks. However, when dynamic channel propagation
characteristics such as line-of-sight (LOS), interference, handover, and
signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) are included in path
optimization, statistical and model-based path planning solutions become
obsolete since they cannot adapt to the dynamic and time-varying wireless
channels, especially in the mmWave bands. In this paper, we propose a novel
model-free actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (AC-DRL) framework for path
optimization in UAV-assisted 5G mmWave wireless networks, which combines four
important aspects of UAV communication: \textit{flight time, handover,
connectivity and SINR}. We train an AC-RL agent that enables a UAV connected to
a gNB to determine the optimal path to a desired destination in the shortest
possible time with minimal gNB handover, while maintaining connectivity and the
highest possible SINR. We train our model with data from a powerful ray tracing
tool called Wireless InSite, which uses 3D images of the propagation
environment and provides data that closely resembles the real propagation
environment. The simulation results show that our system has superior
performance in tracking high SINR compared to other selected RL algorithms.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) is used to
visualise atrial fibrosis and scars, providing important information for
personalised atrial fibrillation (AF) treatments. Since manual analysis and
delineations of these images can be both labour-intensive and subject to
variability, we develop an automatic pipeline to perform segmentation of the
left atrial (LA) cavity, the right atrial (RA) cavity, and the wall of both
atria on LGE-MRI. Our method is based on a two-stage nnU-Net architecture,
combining 2D and 3D convolutional networks, and incorporates adaptive histogram
equalisation to improve tissue contrast in the input images and morphological
operations on the output segmentation maps. We achieve Dice similarity
coefficients of 0.92 +/- 0.03, 0.93 +/- 0.03, 0.71 +/- 0.05 and 95% Hausdorff
distances of (3.89 +/- 6.67) mm, (4.42 +/- 1.66) mm and (3.94 +/- 1.83) mm for
LA, RA, and wall, respectively. The accurate delineation of the LA, RA and the
myocardial wall is the first step in analysing atrial structure in
cardiovascular patients, especially those with AF. This can allow clinicians to
provide adequate and personalised treatment plans in a timely manner.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-03 14:42:49</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images plays a
crucial role in land-use monitoring and urban planning. Recent remarkable
progress in deep learning-based methods makes it possible to generate
satisfactory segmentation results. However, existing methods still face
challenges in adapting network parameters to various land cover distributions
and enhancing the interaction between spatial and frequency domain features. To
address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network
(AFENet), which integrates two key components: the Adaptive Frequency and
Spatial feature Interaction Module (AFSIM) and the Selective feature Fusion
Module (SFM). AFSIM dynamically separates and modulates high- and low-frequency
features according to the content of the input image. It adaptively generates
two masks to separate high- and low-frequency components, therefore providing
optimal details and contextual supplementary information for ground object
feature representation. SFM selectively fuses global context and local detailed
features to enhance the network's representation capability. Hence, the
interactions between frequency and spatial features are further enhanced.
Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the
proposed AFENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also
validate the effectiveness of AFSIM and SFM in managing diverse land cover
types and complex scenarios. Our codes are available at
https://github.com/oucailab/AFENet.</p>

regarding the homotopy category of flat modules to study
${\mathbb{K}}({S\rm{SF}}\mbox{-}R)$, the homotopy category of $S$-strongly flat

$R$. The category ${\mathbb{K}}({S\rm{SF}}\mbox{-}R)$ is an intermediate
triangulated category that includes ${\mathbb{K}}({\rm{Prj}\mbox{-}} R)$, the
homotopy category of projective $R$-modules, which is always well generated by

the homotopy category of flat $R$-modules, which is well generated if and only

corresponding inclusion functors and the existence of their adjoints. In this

the notion of $S$-almost well generated triangulated categories. If $R$ is an

<p class='card-text'>While modeling multi-contact manipulation as a quasi-static mechanical
process transitioning between different contact equilibria, we propose
formulating it as a planning and optimization problem, explicitly evaluating
(i) contact stability and (ii) robustness to sensor noise. Specifically, we
conduct a comprehensive study on multi-manipulator control strategies, focusing
on dual-arm execution in a planar peg-in-hole task and extending it to the
Multi-Manipulator Multiple Peg-in-Hole (MMPiH) problem to explore increased
task complexity. Our framework employs Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to
parameterize desired trajectories and Black-Box Optimization (BBO) with a
comprehensive cost function incorporating friction cone constraints, squeeze

training, we enhance the robustness of the learned policies. To evaluate the
friction cone cost in experiments, we test the optimal trajectories computed
for various contact surfaces, i.e., with different coefficients of friction.
The stability cost is analytical explained and tested its necessity in
simulation. The robustness performance is quantified through variations of hole

<p class='card-text'>In a complex environment, for a mobile robot to safely and collision - free
avoid all obstacles, it poses high requirements for its intelligence level.
Given that the information such as the position and geometric characteristics
of obstacles is random, the control parameters of the robot, such as velocity
and angular velocity, are also prone to random deviations. To address this
issue in the framework of the Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System,
this paper proposes a global path control scheme for mobile robots based on
deep learning. First of all, the dynamic equation of the mobile robot is
established. According to the linear velocity and angular velocity of the
mobile robot, its motion behaviors are divided into obstacle - avoidance
behavior, target - turning behavior, and target approaching behavior.
Subsequently, the neural network method in deep learning is used to build a
global path planning model for the robot. On this basis, a fuzzy controller is
designed with the help of a fuzzy control algorithm to correct the deviations
that occur during path planning, thereby achieving optimized control of the
robot's global path. In addition, considering edge computing optimization, the
proposed model can process local data at the edge device, reducing the
communication burden between the robot and the central server, and improving
the real time performance of path planning. The experimental results show that
for the mobile robot controlled by the research method in this paper, the
deviation distance of the path angle is within 5 cm, the deviation convergence
can be completed within 10 ms, and the planned path is shorter. This indicates
that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the global path planning
ability of mobile robots in the industrial Internet environment and promote the
collaborative operation of robots through edge computing optimization.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper presents an adaptive path planner for object search in
agricultural fields using UAVs. The path planner uses a high-altitude coverage
flight path and plans additional low-altitude inspections when the detection
network is uncertain. The path planner was evaluated in an offline simulation
environment containing real-world images. We trained a YOLOv8 detection network
to detect artificial plants placed in grass fields to showcase the potential of
our path planner. We evaluated the effect of different detection certainty
measures, optimized the path planning parameters, investigated the effects of
localization errors and different numbers of objects in the field. The YOLOv8
detection confidence worked best to differentiate between true and false
positive detections and was therefore used in the adaptive planner. The optimal
parameters of the path planner depended on the distribution of objects in the
field, when the objects were uniformly distributed, more low-altitude
inspections were needed compared to a non-uniform distribution of objects,
resulting in a longer path length. The adaptive planner proved to be robust
against localization uncertainty. When increasing the number of objects, the
flight path length increased, especially when the objects were uniformly
distributed. When the objects were non-uniformly distributed, the adaptive path
planner yielded a shorter path than a low-altitude coverage path, even with
high number of objects. Overall, the presented adaptive path planner allowed to
find non-uniformly distributed objects in a field faster than a coverage path
planner and resulted in a compatible detection accuracy. The path planner is

<p class='card-text'>The segmentation of pelvic fracture fragments in CT and X-ray images is
crucial for trauma diagnosis, surgical planning, and intraoperative guidance.
However, accurately and efficiently delineating the bone fragments remains a
significant challenge due to complex anatomy and imaging limitations. The
PENGWIN challenge, organized as a MICCAI 2024 satellite event, aimed to advance
automated fracture segmentation by benchmarking state-of-the-art algorithms on
these complex tasks. A diverse dataset of 150 CT scans was collected from
multiple clinical centers, and a large set of simulated X-ray images was
generated using the DeepDRR method. Final submissions from 16 teams worldwide
were evaluated under a rigorous multi-metric testing scheme. The top-performing
CT algorithm achieved an average fragment-wise intersection over union (IoU) of
0.930, demonstrating satisfactory accuracy. However, in the X-ray task, the
best algorithm attained an IoU of 0.774, highlighting the greater challenges
posed by overlapping anatomical structures. Beyond the quantitative evaluation,
the challenge revealed methodological diversity in algorithm design. Variations
in instance representation, such as primary-secondary classification versus
boundary-core separation, led to differing segmentation strategies. Despite
promising results, the challenge also exposed inherent uncertainties in
fragment definition, particularly in cases of incomplete fractures. These
findings suggest that interactive segmentation approaches, integrating human
decision-making with task-relevant information, may be essential for improving
model reliability and clinical applicability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>High-level decision-making for dynamical systems often involves performance
and safety specifications that are activated or deactivated depending on
conditions related to the system state and commands. Such decision-making
problems can be naturally formulated as optimization problems where these
conditional activations are regulated by discrete variables. However, solving
these problems can be challenging numerically, even on powerful computing
platforms, especially when the dynamics are nonlinear. In this work, we
consider decision-making for nonlinear systems where certain constraints, as
well as possible terms in the cost function, are activated or deactivated
depending on the system state and commands. We show that these problems can be
formulated either as mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) or as
mathematical programs with vanishing constraints (MPVCs), where the former
formulation involves discrete decision variables, whereas the latter relies on
continuous variables subject to structured nonconvex constraints. We discuss
the different solution methods available for both formulations and demonstrate
them on optimal trajectory planning problems in various aerospace applications.
Finally, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of the MINLP and MPVC
approaches through a focused case study on powered descent guidance with
divert-feasible regions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In this paper we detail the methods used for obstacle avoidance, path
planning, and trajectory tracking that helped us win the adult-sized,
autonomous humanoid soccer league in RoboCup 2024. Our team was undefeated for
all seated matches and scored 45 goals over 6 games, winning the championship
game 6 to 1. During the competition, a major challenge for collision avoidance
was the measurement noise coming from bipedal locomotion and a limited field of
view (FOV). Furthermore, obstacles would sporadically jump in and out of our
planned trajectory. At times our estimator would place our robot inside a hard
constraint. Any planner in this competition must also be be computationally
efficient enough to re-plan and react in real time. This motivated our approach
to trajectory generation and tracking. In many scenarios long-term and
short-term planning is needed. To efficiently find a long-term general path
that avoids all obstacles we developed DAVG (Dynamic Augmented Visibility
Graphs). DAVG focuses on essential path planning by setting certain regions to
be active based on obstacles and the desired goal pose. By augmenting the
states in the graph, turning angles are considered, which is crucial for a
large soccer playing robot as turning may be more costly. A trajectory is
formed by linearly interpolating between discrete points generated by DAVG. A
modified version of model predictive control (MPC) is used to then track this
trajectory called cf-MPC (Collision-Free MPC). This ensures short-term
planning. Without having to switch formulations cf-MPC takes into account the
robot dynamics and collision free constraints. Without a hard switch the
control input can smoothly transition in cases where the noise places our robot
inside a constraint boundary. The nonlinear formulation runs at approximately
120 Hz, while the quadratic version achieves around 400 Hz.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Active 3D scene representation is pivotal in modern robotics applications,
including remote inspection, manipulation, and telepresence. Traditional
methods primarily optimize geometric fidelity or rendering accuracy, but often
overlook operator-specific objectives, such as safety-critical coverage or
task-driven viewpoints. This limitation leads to suboptimal viewpoint
selection, particularly in constrained environments such as nuclear
decommissioning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates expert operator preferences into the active 3D scene representation
pipeline. Specifically, we employ Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) to guide robotic path planning, reshaping the reward function based on
expert input. To capture operator-specific priorities, we conduct interactive
choice experiments that evaluate user preferences in 3D scene representation.
We validate our framework using a UR3e robotic arm for reactor tile inspection
in a nuclear decommissioning scenario. Compared to baseline methods, our
approach enhances scene representation while optimizing trajectory efficiency.
The RLHF-based policy consistently outperforms random selection, prioritizing
task-critical details. By unifying explicit 3D geometric modeling with implicit

enhanced automation in nuclear decommissioning, remote maintenance, and other

<p class='card-text'>Data discovery from data lakes is an essential application in modern data
science. While many previous studies focused on improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of data discovery, little attention has been paid to the
usability of such applications. In particular, exploring data discovery results
can be cumbersome due to the cognitive load involved in understanding raw
tabular results and identifying insights to draw conclusions. To address this
challenge, we introduce a new problem -- visualization recommendation for data
discovery over data lakes -- which aims at automatically identifying
visualizations that highlight relevant or desired trends in the results
returned by data discovery engines. We propose LakeVisage, an end-to-end
framework as the first solution to this problem. Given a data lake, a data
discovery engine, and a user-specified query table, LakeVisage intelligently
explores the space of visualizations and recommends the most useful and
``interesting'' visualization plans. To this end, we developed (i) approaches
to smartly construct the candidate visualization plans from the results of the
data discovery engine and (ii) effective pruning strategies to filter out less
interesting plans so as to accelerate the visual analysis. Experimental results

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Gilles Crommen, Jad Beyhum, Ingrid Van Keilegom</h6>

<p class='card-text'>In this work, we are interested in studying the causal effect of an
endogenous binary treatment on a dependently censored duration outcome. By
dependent censoring, it is meant that the duration time ($T$) and right
censoring time ($C$) are not statistically independent of each other, even
after conditioning on the measured covariates. The endogeneity issue is handled
by making use of a binary instrumental variable for the treatment. To deal with
the dependent censoring problem, it is assumed that on the stratum of
compliers: (i) $T$ follows a semiparametric proportional hazards model; (ii)
$C$ follows a fully parametric model; and (iii) the relation between $T$ and
$C$ is modeled by a parametric copula, such that the association parameter can
be left unspecified. In this framework, the treatment effect of interest is the
complier causal hazard ratio (CCHR). We devise an estimation procedure that is
based on a weighted maximum likelihood approach, where the weights are the
probabilities of an observation coming from a complier. The weights are
estimated non-parametrically in a first stage, followed by the estimation of
the CCHR. Novel conditions under which the model is identifiable are given, a
two-step estimation procedure is proposed and some important asymptotic
properties are established. Simulations are used to assess the validity and
finite-sample performance of the estimation procedure. Finally, we apply the
approach to estimate the CCHR of both job training programs on unemployment
duration and periodic screening examinations on time until death from breast
cancer. The data come from the National Job Training Partnership Act study and
the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York experiment respectively.</p>

  Rooftop Infrastructure Assessment</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-02 19:43:20</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Rooftop 3D reconstruction using UAV-based photogrammetry offers a promising
solution for infrastructure assessment, but existing methods often require high
percentages of image overlap and extended flight times to ensure model accuracy
when using autonomous flight paths. This study systematically evaluates key
flight parameters-ground sampling distance (GSD) and image overlap-to optimize
the 3D reconstruction of complex rooftop infrastructure. Controlled UAV flights
were conducted over a multi-segment rooftop at Queen's University using a DJI
Phantom 4 Pro V2, with varied GSD and overlap settings. The collected data were
processed using Reality Capture software and evaluated against ground truth
models generated from UAV-based LiDAR and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS).
Experimental results indicate that a GSD range of 0.75-1.26 cm combined with
85% image overlap achieves a high degree of model accuracy, while minimizing
images collected and flight time. These findings provide guidance for planning
autonomous UAV flight paths for efficient rooftop assessments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Visual Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools for robotic
systems, enabling cross-task generalization, dynamic environmental interaction,
and long-horizon planning through multimodal perception and semantic reasoning.
However, existing open-source VLMs predominantly trained for generic
vision-language alignment tasks fail to model temporally correlated action
semantics that are crucial for robotic manipulation effectively. While current
image-based fine-tuning methods partially adapt VLMs to robotic applications,
they fundamentally disregard temporal evolution patterns in video sequences and
suffer from visual feature entanglement between robotic agents, manipulated
objects, and environmental contexts, thereby limiting semantic decoupling
capability for atomic actions and compromising model generalizability.To
overcome these challenges, this work presents RoboAct-CLIP with dual technical
contributions: 1) A dataset reconstruction framework that performs
semantic-constrained action unit segmentation and re-annotation on open-source
robotic videos, constructing purified training sets containing singular atomic
actions (e.g., "grasp"); 2) A temporal-decoupling fine-tuning strategy based on
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) architecture, which disentangles
temporal action features across video frames from object-centric
characteristics to achieve hierarchical representation learning of robotic
atomic actions.Experimental results in simulated environments demonstrate that
the RoboAct-CLIP pretrained model achieves a 12% higher success rate than
baseline VLMs, along with superior generalization in multi-object manipulation
tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Querying and exploring massive collections of data sources, such as data
lakes, has been an essential research topic in the database community. Although
many efforts have been paid in the field of data discovery and data integration
in data lakes, they mainly focused on the scenario where the data lake consists
of structured tables. However, real-world enterprise data lakes are always more
complicated, where there might be silos of multi-modal data sources with
structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. In this paper, we envision
an end-to-end system with declarative interface for querying and analyzing the
multi-modal data lakes. First of all, we come up with a set of multi-modal
operators, which is a unified interface that extends the relational operations
with AI-composed ones to express analytical workloads over data sources in
various modalities. In addition, we formally define the essential steps in the
system, such as data discovery, query planning, query processing and results
aggregation. On the basis of it, we then pinpoint the research challenges and
discuss potential opportunities in realizing and optimizing them with advanced
techniques brought by Large Language Models. Finally, we demonstrate our
preliminary attempts to address this problem and suggest the future plan for
this research topic.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Navigating a collision-free, optimal path for a robot poses a perpetual
challenge, particularly in the presence of moving objects such as humans. In
this study, we formulate the problem of finding an optimal path as a stochastic
optimal control problem. However, obtaining a solution to this problem is
nontrivial. Therefore, we consider a simplified problem, which is more
tractable. For this simplified formulation, we are able to solve the
corresponding Bellman equation. However, the solution obtained from the
simplified problem does not sufficiently address the original problem of
interest. To address the full problem, we propose a numerical procedure where
we solve an optimization problem at each sampling instant. The solution to the

  Gaussian Splatting</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-02 17:59:38</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Bird's-eye view (BEV) perception has gained significant attention because it
provides a unified representation to fuse multiple view images and enables a
wide range of down-stream autonomous driving tasks, such as forecasting and
planning. Recent state-of-the-art models utilize projection-based methods which
formulate BEV perception as query learning to bypass explicit depth estimation.
While we observe promising advancements in this paradigm, they still fall short
of real-world applications because of the lack of uncertainty modeling and
expensive computational requirement. In this work, we introduce GaussianLSS, a
novel uncertainty-aware BEV perception framework that revisits
unprojection-based methods, specifically the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) paradigm,
and enhances them with depth un-certainty modeling. GaussianLSS represents
spatial dispersion by learning a soft depth mean and computing the variance of
the depth distribution, which implicitly captures object extents. We then
transform the depth distribution into 3D Gaussians and rasterize them to
construct uncertainty-aware BEV features. We evaluate GaussianLSS on the
nuScenes dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to
unprojection-based methods. In particular, it provides significant advantages
in speed, running 2.5x faster, and in memory efficiency, using 0.3x less memory
compared to projection-based methods, while achieving competitive performance
with only a 0.4% IoU difference.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-02 17:56:57</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Understanding the complex myocardial architecture is critical for diagnosing
and treating heart disease. However, existing methods often struggle to
accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)
data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous,
intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning
framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a
data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine
a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential
information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape
features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context.
Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33
to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber
trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new,
flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a
level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved,
with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing
disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac
care.</p>

<p class='card-text'>End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable progress by integrating
perception, prediction, and planning into a fully differentiable framework.
Yet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation
is indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a
given trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal
can be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics
and predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving
framework WoTE, which leverages a BEV World model to predict future BEV states
for Trajectory Evaluation. The proposed BEV world model is latency-efficient
compared to image-level world models and can be seamlessly supervised using
off-the-shelf BEV-space traffic simulators. We validate our framework on both
the NAVSIM benchmark and the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark based on the
CARLA simulator, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is released at

<p class='card-text'>Trajectory prediction of other vehicles is crucial for autonomous vehicles,
with applications from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. Typically,
target trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles
exhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in
thermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised
Machine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of
targets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts
the distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and
parameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using
a time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed
virtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only
training data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in
replacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path
planning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for
aerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic
predictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms
for autonomous vehicles.</p>
