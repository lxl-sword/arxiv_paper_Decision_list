  Interactive Digital Twins</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in open-world robot manipulation have been largely driven
by vision-language models (VLMs). While these models exhibit strong
generalization ability in high-level planning, they struggle to predict
low-level robot controls due to limited physical-world understanding. To
address this issue, we propose a model predictive control framework for
open-world manipulation that combines the semantic reasoning capabilities of
VLMs with physically-grounded, interactive digital twins of the real-world
environments. By constructing and simulating the digital twins, our approach
generates feasible motion trajectories, simulates corresponding outcomes, and
prompts the VLM with future observations to evaluate and select the most
suitable outcome based on language instructions of the task. To further enhance
the capability of pre-trained VLMs in understanding complex scenes for robotic
control, we leverage the flexible rendering capabilities of the digital twin to
synthesize the scene at various novel, unoccluded viewpoints. We validate our
approach on a diverse set of complex manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior
performance compared to baseline methods for language-conditioned robotic
control using VLMs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise
for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging world knowledge and reasoning
capabilities. However, current VLA models often struggle with physically
infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long
reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies
reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model
for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and
trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions.
We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling
direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised
fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking
(trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning).
To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a
reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive
experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including
nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of
AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results
showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA
in diverse scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Neighborhood finders and nearest neighbor queries are fundamental parts of
sampling based motion planning algorithms. Using different distance metrics or
otherwise changing the definition of a neighborhood produces different
algorithms with unique empiric and theoretical properties. In \cite{l-pa-06}
LaValle suggests a neighborhood finder for the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree
RRT
  algorithm \cite{l-rrtnt-98} which finds the nearest neighbor of the sampled
point on the swath of the tree, that is on the set of all of the points on the
tree edges, using a hierarchical data structure. In this paper we implement
such a neighborhood finder and show, theoretically and experimentally, that
this results in more efficient algorithms, and suggest a variant of the
Rapidly-exploring Random Graph RRG algorithm \cite{f-isaom-10} that better
exploits the exploration properties of the newly described subroutine for

<p class='card-text'>Sideways information passing is a well-known technique for mitigating the
impact of large build sides in a database query plan. As currently implemented
in production systems, sideways information passing enables only a
uni-directional information flow, as opposed to instance-optimal algorithms,
such as Yannakakis'. On the other hand, the latter require an additional pass
over the input, which hinders adoption in production systems.
  In this paper, we make a step towards enabling single-pass bi-directional
information passing during query execution. We achieve this by statically
analyzing between which tables the information flow is blocked and by
leveraging precomputed join-induced fingerprint columns on FK-tables. On the
JOB benchmark, Parachute improves DuckDB v1.2's end-to-end execution time
without and with semi-join filtering by 1.54x and 1.24x, respectively, when
allowed to use 15% extra space.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper investigates how an autonomous agent can transmit information
through its motion in an adversarial setting. We consider scenarios where an
agent must reach its goal while deceiving an intelligent observer about its
destination. We model this interaction as a dynamic Bayesian game between a
mobile Attacker with a privately known goal and a Defender who infers the
Attacker's intent to allocate defensive resources effectively. We use Perfect
Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (PBNE) as our solution concept and propose a
computationally efficient approach to find it. In the resulting equilibrium,
the Defender employs a simple Markovian strategy, while the Attacker
strategically balances deception and goal efficiency by stochastically mixing
shortest and non-shortest paths to manipulate the Defender's beliefs. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the advantages of our PBNE-based strategies over
existing methods based on one-sided optimization.</p>

  vehicles with probabilistic safety certificates</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Martino Gulisano, Matteo Masoni, Marco Gabiccini, Massimo Guiggiani</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-16 15:50:17</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper presents a disturbance-aware framework that embeds robustness into
minimum-lap-time trajectory optimization for motorsport. Two formulations are
introduced. (i) Open-loop, horizon-based covariance propagation uses worst-case
uncertainty growth over a finite window to tighten tire-friction and
track-limit constraints. (ii) Closed-loop, covariance-aware planning
incorporates a time-varying LQR feedback law in the optimizer, providing a
feedback-consistent estimate of disturbance attenuation and enabling sharper
yet reliable constraint tightening. Both methods yield reference trajectories
for human or artificial drivers: in autonomous applications the modelled
controller can replicate the on-board implementation, while for human driving
accuracy increases with the extent to which the driver can be approximated by
the assumed time-varying LQR policy. Computational tests on a representative
Barcelona-Catalunya sector show that both schemes meet the prescribed safety
probability, yet the closed-loop variant incurs smaller lap-time penalties than
the more conservative open-loop solution, while the nominal (non-robust)
trajectory remains infeasible under the same uncertainties. By accounting for
uncertainty growth and feedback action during planning, the proposed framework
delivers trajectories that are both performance-optimal and probabilistically
safe, advancing minimum-time optimization toward real-world deployment in
high-performance motorsport and autonomous racing.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Earthworms are key drivers of soil function, influencing organic matter
turnover, nutrient cycling, and soil structure. Understanding the environmental
controls on their distribution is essential for predicting the impacts of land
use and climate change on soil ecosystems. While local studies have identified
abiotic drivers of earthworm communities, broad-scale spatial patterns remain
underexplored.
  We developed a multi-species, multi-task deep learning model to jointly
predict the distribution of 77 earthworm species across metropolitan France,
using historical (1960-1970) and contemporary (1990-2020) records. The model
integrates climate, soil, and land cover variables to estimate habitat
suitability. We applied SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to identify key
environmental drivers and used species clustering to reveal ecological response
groups.
  The joint model achieved high predictive performance (TSS >= 0.7) and
improved predictions for rare species compared to traditional species
distribution models. Shared feature extraction across species allowed for more
robust identification of common and contrasting environmental responses.
Precipitation variability, temperature seasonality, and land cover emerged as
dominant predictors of earthworm distribution. Species clustering revealed
distinct ecological strategies tied to climatic and land use gradients.
  Our study advances both the methodological and ecological understanding of
soil biodiversity. We demonstrate the utility of interpretable deep learning
approaches for large-scale soil fauna modeling and provide new insights into
earthworm habitat specialization. These findings support improved soil
biodiversity monitoring and conservation planning in the face of global
environmental change.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in clinical radiotherapy for image-guided
treatment, improving setup accuracy, adaptive planning, and motion management.
However, slow gantry rotation limits performance by introducing motion
artifacts, blurring, and increased dose. This work aims to develop a clinically
feasible method for reconstructing high-quality CBCT volumes from consecutive
limited-angle acquisitions, addressing imaging challenges in time- or
dose-constrained settings. We propose a limited-angle (LA) geometry-integrated
cycle-domain (LA-GICD) framework for CBCT reconstruction, comprising two
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) connected via analytic
cone-beam forward and back projectors. A Projection-DDPM completes missing
projections, followed by back-projection, and an Image-DDPM refines the volume.
This dual-domain design leverages complementary priors from projection and
image spaces to achieve high-quality reconstructions from limited-angle (<= 90
degrees) scans. Performance was evaluated against full-angle reconstruction.
Four board-certified medical physicists conducted assessments. A total of 78
planning CTs in common CBCT geometries were used for training and evaluation.
The method achieved a mean absolute error of 35.5 HU, SSIM of 0.84, and PSNR of
29.8 dB, with visibly reduced artifacts and improved soft-tissue clarity.
LA-GICD's geometry-aware dual-domain learning, embedded in analytic
forward/backward operators, enabled artifact-free, high-contrast
reconstructions from a single 90-degree scan, reducing acquisition time and
dose four-fold. LA-GICD improves limited-angle CBCT reconstruction with strong
data fidelity and anatomical realism. It offers a practical solution for
short-arc acquisitions, enhancing CBCT use in radiotherapy by providing
clinically applicable images with reduced scan time and dose for more accurate,
personalized treatments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In proton therapy of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients, contrast-enhancing
brain lesions (CEBLs) on magnetic resonance imaging are considered predictive
of late radiation-induced lesions. From the observation that CEBLs tend to
concentrate in regions of increased dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LET)
and proximal to the ventricular system, the probability of lesion origin (POLO)
model has been established as a multivariate logistic regression model for the
voxel-wise probability prediction of the CEBL origin. To date, leveraging the
predictive power of the POLO model for treatment planning relies on hand tuning
the dose and LET distribution to minimize the resulting probability
predictions. In this paper, we therefore propose automated POLO model-based
treatment planning by directly integrating POLO calculation and optimization
into plan optimization for LGG patients. We introduce an extension of the
original POLO model including a volumetric correction factor, and a model-based
optimization scheme featuring a linear reformulation of the model together with
feasible optimization functions based on the predicted POLO values. The
developed framework is implemented in the open-source treatment planning
toolkit matRad. Our framework can generate clinically acceptable treatment
plans while automatically taking into account outcome predictions from the POLO
model. It also supports the definition of customized POLO model-based objective
and constraint functions. Optimization results from a sample LGG patient show
that the POLO model-based outcome predictions can be minimized under expected
shifts in dose, LET, and POLO distributions, while sustaining target coverage
($\Delta_{\text{PTV}} \text{d95}_{RBE,fx}\approx{0.03}$, $\Delta_{\text{GTV}}
\text{d95}_{RBE,fx}\approx{0.001}$), even at large NTCP reductions of
$\Delta{\text{NTCP}}\approx{26}\%$.</p>

remains the reliable acquisition of high-resolution, geo-referenced spatial
information to support core activities such as extraction planning and on-site

UAV-based sensing, LiDAR terrain modeling, and deep learning-based object
detection to generate spatially accurate information for open-pit mining

be integrated into an industrial digital twin platform. Unlike traditional
static surveying methods, the system offers higher coverage and automation
potential, with modular components suitable for deployment in real-world

<p class='card-text'>Dual-arm cooperative manipulation holds great promise for tackling complex
real-world tasks that demand seamless coordination and adaptive dynamics.
Despite substantial progress in learning-based motion planning, most approaches
struggle to generalize across diverse manipulation tasks and adapt to dynamic,
unstructured environments, particularly in scenarios involving interactions
between two objects such as assembly, tool use, and bimanual grasping. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel VLM-Assisted Siamese Flow
Diffusion (VLM-SFD) framework for efficient imitation learning in dual-arm
cooperative manipulation. The proposed VLM-SFD framework exhibits outstanding
adaptability, significantly enhancing the ability to rapidly adapt and
generalize to diverse real-world tasks from only a minimal number of human
demonstrations. Specifically, we propose a Siamese Flow Diffusion Network
(SFDNet) employs a dual-encoder-decoder Siamese architecture to embed two
target objects into a shared latent space, while a diffusion-based conditioning
process-conditioned by task instructions-generates two-stream object-centric
motion flows that guide dual-arm coordination. We further design a dynamic task
assignment strategy that seamlessly maps the predicted 2D motion flows into 3D
space and incorporates a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to adaptively
assign the optimal motion to each robotic arm over time. Experiments validate
the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to diverse manipulation tasks while maintaining high efficiency and
adaptability. The code and demo videos are publicly available on our project

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-16 12:37:28</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Kinodynamic planning of articulated vehicles in cluttered environments faces
additional challenges arising from high-dimensional state space and complex
system dynamics. Built upon [1],[2], this work proposes the DE-AGT algorithm
that grows a tree using pre-computed motion primitives (MPs) and A* heuristics.
The first feature of DE-AGT is a delayed expansion of MPs. In particular, the
MPs are divided into different modes, which are ranked online. With the MP
classification and prioritization, DE-AGT expands the most promising mode of
MPs first, which eliminates unnecessary computation and finds solutions faster.
To obtain the cost-to-go heuristic for nonholonomic articulated vehicles, we
rely on supervised learning and train neural networks for fast and accurate
cost-to-go prediction. The learned heuristic is used for online mode ranking
and node selection. Another feature of DE-AGT is the improved goal-reaching.
Exactly reaching a goal state usually requires a constant connection checking
with the goal by solving steering problems -- non-trivial and time-consuming
for articulated vehicles. The proposed termination scheme overcomes this
challenge by tightly integrating a light-weight trajectory tracking controller
with the search process. DE-AGT is implemented for autonomous parking of a
general car-like tractor with 3-trailer. Simulation results show an average of
10x acceleration compared to a previous method.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate calibration of sensor extrinsic parameters for ground robotic
systems (i.e., relative poses) is crucial for ensuring spatial alignment and
achieving high-performance perception. However, existing calibration methods
typically require complex and often human-operated processes to collect data.
Moreover, most frameworks neglect acoustic sensors, thereby limiting the
associated systems' auditory perception capabilities. To alleviate these
issues, we propose an observability-aware active calibration method for ground
robots with multimodal sensors, including a microphone array, a LiDAR
(exteroceptive sensors), and wheel encoders (proprioceptive sensors). Unlike
traditional approaches, our method enables active trajectory optimization for
online data collection and calibration, contributing to the development of more
intelligent robotic systems. Specifically, we leverage the Fisher information
matrix (FIM) to quantify parameter observability and adopt its minimum
eigenvalue as an optimization metric for trajectory generation via B-spline
curves. Through planning and replanning of robot trajectory online, the method
enhances the observability of multi-sensor extrinsic parameters. The
effectiveness and advantages of our method have been demonstrated through
numerical simulations and real-world experiments. For the benefit of the

<p class='card-text'>We study online decision making problems under resource constraints, where
both reward and cost functions are drawn from distributions that may change
adversarially over time. We focus on two canonical settings: $(i)$ online
resource allocation where rewards and costs are observed before action
selection, and $(ii)$ online learning with resource constraints where they are
observed after action selection, under full feedback or bandit feedback. It is
well known that achieving sublinear regret in these settings is impossible when
reward and cost distributions may change arbitrarily over time. To address this
challenge, we analyze a framework in which the learner is guided by a spending
plan--a sequence prescribing expected resource usage across rounds. We design
general (primal-)dual methods that achieve sublinear regret with respect to
baselines that follow the spending plan. Crucially, the performance of our
algorithms improves when the spending plan ensures a well-balanced distribution

<p class='card-text'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is extensively employed in medical diagnostics
and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to its non-invasive nature
and high temporal resolution. However, EEG analysis faces significant
challenges, including noise, nonstationarity, and inter-subject variability,
which hinder its clinical utility. Traditional neural networks often lack
integration with biophysical knowledge, limiting their interpretability,
robustness, and potential for medical translation. To address these
limitations, this study introduces NeuroPhysNet, a novel Physics-Informed
Neural Network (PINN) framework tailored for EEG signal analysis and motor
imagery classification in medical contexts. NeuroPhysNet incorporates the
FitzHugh-Nagumo model, embedding neurodynamical principles to constrain
predictions and enhance model robustness. Evaluated on the BCIC-IV-2a dataset,
the framework achieved superior accuracy and generalization compared to
conventional methods, especially in data-limited and cross-subject scenarios,
which are common in clinical settings. By effectively integrating biophysical
insights with data-driven techniques, NeuroPhysNet not only advances BCI
applications but also holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and
reliability of clinical diagnostics, such as motor disorder assessments and
neurorehabilitation planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Flooding remains a major global challenge, worsened by climate change and
urbanization, demanding advanced solutions for effective disaster management.
While traditional 2D flood mapping techniques provide limited insights, 3D
flood mapping, powered by deep learning (DL), offers enhanced capabilities by
integrating flood extent and depth. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of deep learning-based 3D flood mapping, emphasizing its advancements over 2D
maps by integrating flood extent and depth for effective disaster management
and urban planning. The survey categorizes deep learning techniques into task
decomposition and end-to-end approaches, applicable to both static and dynamic
flood features. We compare key DL architectures, highlighting their respective
roles in enhancing prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
Additionally, this work explores diverse data sources such as digital elevation
models, satellite imagery, rainfall, and simulated data, outlining their roles
in 3D flood mapping. The applications reviewed range from real-time flood
prediction to long-term urban planning and risk assessment. However,
significant challenges persist, including data scarcity, model
interpretability, and integration with traditional hydrodynamic models. This
survey concludes by suggesting future directions to address these limitations,
focusing on enhanced datasets, improved models, and policy implications for
flood management. This survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DL techniques for more robust and reliable 3D flood mapping,
fostering improved flood management strategies.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-16 07:19:02</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We study the Logistic Contextual Slate Bandit problem, where, at each round,
an agent selects a slate of $N$ items from an exponentially large set (of size
$2^{\Omega(N)}$) of candidate slates provided by the environment. A single
binary reward, determined by a logistic model, is observed for the chosen
slate. Our objective is to develop algorithms that maximize cumulative reward
over $T$ rounds while maintaining low per-round computational costs. We propose
two algorithms, Slate-GLM-OFU and Slate-GLM-TS, that accomplish this goal.
These algorithms achieve $N^{O(1)}$ per-round time complexity via local
planning (independent slot selections), and low regret through global learning
(joint parameter estimation). We provide theoretical and empirical evidence
supporting these claims. Under a well-studied diversity assumption, we prove
that Slate-GLM-OFU incurs only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of synthetic settings demonstrate that our
algorithms consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines, achieving both
the lowest regret and the fastest runtime. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm
to select in-context examples in prompts of Language Models for solving binary
classification tasks such as sentiment analysis. Our approach achieves
competitive test accuracy, making it a viable alternative in practical
scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Optimizing urban freight logistics is critical for developing sustainable,
low-carbon cities. Traditional methods often rely on manual coordination of
simulation tools, optimization solvers, and expert-driven workflows, limiting
their efficiency and scalability. This paper presents an agentic system
architecture that leverages the model context protocol (MCP) to orchestrate
multi-agent collaboration among scientific tools for autonomous,
simulation-informed optimization in urban logistics. The system integrates
generative AI agents with domain-specific engines - such as Gurobi for
optimization and AnyLogic for agent-based simulation - forming a generative
digital twin capable of reasoning, planning, and acting across multimodal
freight networks. By incorporating integrated chatbots, retrieval-augmented
generation, and structured memory, the framework enables agents to interpret
user intent from natural language conversations, retrieve relevant datasets and
models, coordinate solvers and simulators, and execute complex workflows. We
demonstrate this approach through a freight decarbonization case study,
showcasing how MCP enables modular, interoperable, and adaptive agent behavior
across diverse toolchains. The results reveal that our system transforms
digital twins from static visualizations into autonomous, decision-capable
systems, advancing the frontiers of urban operations research. By enabling
context-aware, generative agents to operate scientific tools automatically and
collaboratively, this framework supports more intelligent, accessible, and
dynamic decision-making in transportation planning and smart city management.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In this study, we explore the potential of using TianQin missions to probe
the local gravitational effects of dark matter. The TianQin project plans to
launch satellites at both low and high orbits. High-precision orbit
determination is expected to assist in the Earth's gravity or gravitational

possible to constrain the amount of dark matter between the two spheres, hence
placing a local constraint on dark matter's gravity effect. Our results show
the capability of TianQin in detecting the density of dark matter around Earth,
with an ultimate sensitivity to a value of $10^{-8}\,\,{\rm kg\,\,m^{-3}}$.
This detection limit surpasses the estimated bounds for the solar system and
the observation results for our Galaxy by approximately 7 and 14 orders of

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-16 00:59:04</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Accurate prediction of crop yield is critical for supporting food security,
agricultural planning, and economic decision-making. However, yield forecasting
remains a significant challenge due to the complex and nonlinear relationships
between weather variables and crop production, as well as spatial heterogeneity
across agricultural regions. We propose DSNet, a deep neural network
architecture that integrates functional and scalar predictors with spatially
varying coefficients and spatial random effects. The method is designed to
flexibly model spatially indexed functional data, such as daily temperature
curves, and their relationship to variability in the response, while accounting
for spatial correlation. DSNet mitigates the curse of dimensionality through a
low-rank structure inspired by the spatially varying functional index model
(SVFIM). Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that DSNet
outperforms state-of-the-art functional regression models for spatial data,
when the functional predictors exhibit complex structure and their relationship
with the response varies spatially in a potentially nonstationary manner.
Application to corn yield data from the U.S. Midwest demonstrates that DSNet
achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to both leading machine learning
approaches and parametric statistical models. These results highlight the
model's robustness and its potential applicability to other weather-sensitive
crops.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Mobile edge computing (MEC) enhances the performance of 5G networks by
enabling low-latency, high-speed services through deploying data units of the
base station on edge servers located near mobile users. However, determining
the optimal capacity of these servers while dynamically offloading tasks and
allocating computing resources to meet uncertain user demands presents
significant challenges. This paper focuses on the design and planning of edge
servers with the dual objectives of minimizing capacity requirements and
reducing service latency for 5G services. To handle the complexity of uncertain
user demands, we formulate the problem as a two-stage stochastic model, which
can be linearized into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. We
propose a novel approach called accelerated Benders decomposition (ABD) to
solve the problem at a large network scale. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that ABD achieves the optimal solution of MILP while significantly reducing

<p class='card-text'>This work presents a formal framework for quantifying the internal
dependencies between functional subsystems within artificial agents whose
belief states are composed of structured linguistic fragments. Building on the
Semantic Manifold framework, which organizes belief content into functional
sectors and stratifies them across hierarchical levels of abstraction, we
introduce a system of sectoral coupling constants that characterize how one
cognitive sector influences another within a fixed level of abstraction. The
complete set of these constants forms an agent-specific coupling profile that
governs internal information flow, shaping the agent's overall processing
tendencies and cognitive style. We provide a detailed taxonomy of these
intra-level coupling roles, covering domains such as perceptual integration,
memory access and formation, planning, meta-cognition, execution control, and
affective modulation. We also explore how these coupling profiles generate
feedback loops, systemic dynamics, and emergent signatures of cognitive
behavior. Methodologies for inferring these profiles from behavioral or
internal agent data are outlined, along with a discussion of how these
couplings evolve across abstraction levels. This framework contributes a
mechanistic and interpretable approach to modeling complex cognition, with
applications in AI system design, alignment diagnostics, and the analysis of

<p class='card-text'>While gluon fusion dominates Higgs pair production at the LHC, vector boson
fusion (VBF) offers a unique window into Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)
physics through its distinctive kinematic features and direct sensitivity to
Higgs-vector boson interactions. We perform a comprehensive analysis of double
Higgs production via VBF in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT),
systematically investigating how dimension-6 and dimension-8 bosonic operators
- particularly those involving field derivatives - can enhance the production
rate. We identify the most relevant Wilson coefficients (WCs) affecting the
trilinear Higgs coupling ($hhh$) and Higgs-vector boson interactions ($hVV$,
$hhVV$). Using constraints from global fits and interpolating fit results for
unconstrained WCs with Naive Dimensional Analysis, we assess their effects on
the $VV \to hh$ ($V = W,Z$) scattering amplitudes and cross-sections. Our
analysis includes a study of EFT convergence and validity in models with scalar
extensions of the SM. Numerical simulations for the planned High-Luminosity LHC
experiment (HL-LHC) in general reveal only a modest and challenging to detect
enhancement of the VBF di-Higgs production rate over the SM prediction.
However, we show that in optimistic scenarios, such a process could be observed
at the HL-LHC. In certain cases, when the enhancement is dominated by the
dimension-6 or dimension-8 operators containing field derivatives (and thus
leading to stronger energy-dependent effects), this channel becomes competitive
with di-Higgs production via gluon fusion. This work highlights the role of VBF
di-Higgs production as a complementary channel for probing anomalous Higgs
