<p class='card-text'>There is now a large body of techniques, many based on formal methods, for
describing and realizing complex robotics tasks, including those involving a
variety of rich goals and time-extended behavior. This paper explores the
limits of what sorts of tasks are specifiable, examining how the precise
grounding of specifications, that is, whether the specification is given in
terms of the robot's states, its actions and observations, its knowledge, or
some other information,is crucial to whether a given task can be specified.
While prior work included some description of particular choices for this
grounding, our contribution treats this aspect as a first-class citizen: we
introduce notation to deal with a large class of problems, and examine how the
grounding affects what tasks can be posed. The results demonstrate that certain
classes of tasks are specifiable under different combinations of groundings.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Several space missions are proposed or planned for the coming two decades
dedicated or including mid- to high-resolution spectropolarimetry on a wide UV
band. This includes the European instrument Pollux for the NASA HWO flagship
mission, the NASA SMEX candidate Polstar, and the French nanosatellite
demonstrator CASSTOR. We are developing UV polarimeters for these missions
thanks to a R&D program funded by CNES. For the mid- and near-UV, i.e. above
120 nm, birefringent material (MgF2) can be used to produce a polarimeter. This
is the baseline for Polstar, CASSTOR, and the MUV and NUV channels of Pollux.
Prototypes have been built and tested with excellent results, and further tests
are ongoing to fully characterize them. For the FUV channel of Pollux however,
it is not possible to use this technology and we have instead studied a design
based on mirrors only. We will present the various missions and instruments,
their technical challenges, as well as the R&D work performed on UV
polarimeters and the proposed design solutions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reconstruction of high-definition maps is a crucial task in perceiving the
autonomous driving environment, as its accuracy directly impacts the
reliability of prediction and planning capabilities in downstream modules.
Current vectorized map reconstruction methods based on the DETR framework
encounter limitations due to the redundancy in the decoder structure,
necessitating the stacking of six decoder layers to maintain performance, which
significantly hampers computational efficiency. To tackle this issue, we
introduce FastMap, an innovative framework designed to reduce decoder
redundancy in existing approaches. FastMap optimizes the decoder architecture
by employing a single-layer, two-stage transformer that achieves multilevel
representation capabilities. Our framework eliminates the conventional practice
of randomly initializing queries and instead incorporates a heatmap-guided
query generation module during the decoding phase, which effectively maps image
features into structured query vectors using learnable positional encoding.
Additionally, we propose a geometry-constrained point-to-line loss mechanism
for FastMap, which adeptly addresses the challenge of distinguishing highly
homogeneous features that often arise in traditional point-to-point loss
computations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastMap achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets, with its
decoder operating 3.2 faster than the baseline. Code and more demos are
available at https://github.com/hht1996ok/FastMap.</p>

its non-linear, non-convex properties and sensitivity to initial values, making
interactions between vehicles difficult to control. In this paper, inspired by
topological planning, we propose a differentiable local homotopy invariant

of generating multiple interactive trajectories from the same initial values,

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-07 13:56:14</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Despite various efforts, decarbonizing the heating sector remains a
significant challenge. To tackle it by smart planning, the availability of
highly resolved heating demand data is key. Several existing models provide
heating demand only for specific applications. Typically, they either offer
time series for a larger area or annual demand data on a building level, but
not both simultaneously. Additionally, the diversity in heating demand across
different buildings is often not considered. To address these limitations, this
paper presents a novel method for generating temporally resolved heat demand
time series at the building level using publicly available data. The approach
integrates a thermal building model with stochastic occupancy simulations that
account for variability in user behavior. As a result, the tool serves as a
cost-effective resource for cross-sectoral energy system planning and policy
development, particularly with a focus on the heating sector. The obtained data
can be used to assess the impact of renovation and retrofitting strategies, or
to analyze district heating expansion. To illustrate the potential applications
of this approach, we conducted a case study in Puertollano (Spain), where we
prepared a dataset of heating demand with hourly resolution for each of 9,298
residential buildings. This data was then used to compare two different
pathways for the thermal renovation of these buildings. By relying on publicly
available data, this method can be adapted and applied to various European
regions, offering broad usability in energy system optimization and analysis of
decarbonization strategies.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Self-modeling enables robots to build task-agnostic models of their
morphology and kinematics based on data that can be automatically collected,
with minimal human intervention and prior information, thereby enhancing
machine intelligence. Recent research has highlighted the potential of
data-driven technology in modeling the morphology and kinematics of robots.
However, existing self-modeling methods suffer from either low modeling quality
or excessive data acquisition costs. Beyond morphology and kinematics, texture
is also a crucial component of robots, which is challenging to model and
remains unexplored. In this work, a high-quality, texture-aware, and link-level
method is proposed for robot self-modeling. We utilize three-dimensional (3D)
Gaussians to represent the static morphology and texture of robots, and cluster
the 3D Gaussians to construct neural ellipsoid bones, whose deformations are
controlled by the transformation matrices generated by a kinematic neural
network. The 3D Gaussians and kinematic neural network are trained using data
pairs composed of joint angles, camera parameters and multi-view images without
depth information. By feeding the kinematic neural network with joint angles,
we can utilize the well-trained model to describe the corresponding morphology,
kinematics and texture of robots at the link level, and render robot images
from different perspectives with the aid of 3D Gaussian splatting. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that the established model can be exploited to perform
downstream tasks such as motion planning and inverse kinematics.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Comets are the most pristine planetesimals left from the formation of the
Solar System. They carry unique information on the materials and the physical
processes which led to the presence of planets and moons. Many important
questions about cometary physics, such as origin, constituents and mechanism of
cometary activity, remain unanswered. The next perihelion of comet 1P/Halley,
in 2061, is an excellent opportunity to revisit this object of outstanding
scientific and cultural relevance. In 1986, during its latest approach to the
Sun, several flyby targeted Halley's comet to observe its nucleus and shed
light on its properties, origin, and evolution. However, due to its retrograde
orbit and high ecliptic inclination, the quality of data was limited by the
large relative velocity and short time spent by the spacecraft inside the coma
of the comet. A rendezvous mission like ESA/Rosetta would overcome such
limitations, but the trajectory design is extremely challenging due to the
shortcomings of current propulsion technology. Given the considerable lead
times of spacecraft development and the long duration of the interplanetary
transfer required to reach the comet, it is imperative to start mission
planning several decades in advance. This study presents a low-thrust
rendezvous strategy to reach the comet before the phase of intense activity
during the close approach to the Sun. The trajectory design combines a
gravity-assist maneuver with electric propulsion arcs to maximize scientific
payload mass while constraining transfer duration. A propulsive plane change
maneuver would be prohibitive. To keep the propellant budget within reasonable
limits, most of the plane change maneuver is achieved via either a Jupiter or a
Saturn flyby. The interplanetary low-thrust gravity-assisted trajectory design
strategy is described, followed by the presentation of multiple
proof-of-concept solutions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Green hydrogen has multiple use cases and is produced from renewable energy,
such as solar or wind energy. It can be stored in large quantities, decoupling
renewable energy generation from its use, and is therefore considered essential
for achieving a climate-neutral economy. The intermittency of renewable energy
generation and the stochastic nature of demand are, however, challenging
factors for the dynamic planning of hydrogen storage and transportation. This
holds particularly in the early-adoption phase when hydrogen distribution
occurs through vehicle-based networks. We therefore address the Dynamic
Inventory Routing Problem (DIRP) under stochastic supply and demand with direct
deliveries for the vehicle-based distribution of hydrogen. To solve this
problem, we propose a Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework that
integrates constraints into the learning process and incorporates parameterized
post-decision state value predictions. Additionally, we introduce
Lookahead-based CRL (LCRL), which improves decision-making over a multi-period
horizon to enhance short-term planning while maintaining the value predictions.
Our computational experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CRL and LCRL across
diverse instances. Our learning methods provide near-optimal solutions on small
scale instances that are solved via value iteration. Furthermore, both methods
outperform typical deep learning approaches such as Proximal Policy
Optimization, as well as classical inventory heuristics, such as
(s,S)-policy-based and Power-of-Two-based heuristics. Furthermore, LCRL
achieves a 10% improvement over CRL on average, albeit with higher
computational requirements. Analyses of optimal replenishment policies reveal
that accounting for stochastic supply and demand influences these policies,
showing the importance of our addition to the DIRP.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Traffic simulation, complementing real-world data with a long-tail
distribution, allows for effective evaluation and enhancement of the ability of
autonomous vehicles to handle accident-prone scenarios. Simulating such
safety-critical scenarios is nontrivial, however, from log data that are
typically regular scenarios, especially in consideration of dynamic adversarial
interactions between the future motions of autonomous vehicles and surrounding
traffic participants. To address it, this paper proposes an innovative and
efficient strategy, termed IntSim, that explicitly decouples the driving
intentions of surrounding actors from their motion planning for realistic and
efficient safety-critical simulation. We formulate the adversarial transfer of
driving intention as an optimization problem, facilitating extensive
exploration of diverse attack behaviors and efficient solution convergence.
Simultaneously, intention-conditioned motion planning benefits from powerful
deep models and large-scale real-world data, permitting the simulation of
realistic motion behaviors for actors. Specially, through adapting driving
intentions based on environments, IntSim facilitates the flexible realization
of dynamic adversarial interactions with autonomous vehicles. Finally,
extensive open-loop and closed-loop experiments on real-world datasets,
including nuScenes and Waymo, demonstrate that the proposed IntSim achieves
state-of-the-art performance in simulating realistic safety-critical scenarios
and further improves planners in handling such scenarios.</p>

existing VLM methods struggle to guide robots through precise sequences of fine

planning algorithm that empowers robots to perform fast, precise, and
error-correctable fine manipulation. Our method decomposes complex tasks into
sub-actions and maintains three key data structures: task memory structure, 2D
topology graphs, and 3D spatial networks, achieving high-precision
spatial-semantic fusion. These three components collectively accumulate and
store critical information throughout task execution, providing rich context
for our task-oriented VLM interaction mechanism. This enables VLMs to
dynamically adjust guidance based on real-time feedback, generating precise

<p class='card-text'>Robotic search and rescue, exploration, and inspection require trajectory
planning across a variety of domains. A popular approach to trajectory planning
for these types of missions is ergodic search, which biases a trajectory to
spend time in parts of the exploration domain that are believed to contain more
information. Most prior work on ergodic search has been limited to searching
simple surfaces, like a 2D Euclidean plane or a sphere, as they rely on
projecting functions defined on the exploration domain onto analytically
obtained Fourier basis functions. In this paper, we extend ergodic search to
any surface that can be approximated by a triangle mesh. The basis functions
are approximated through finite element methods on a triangle mesh of the
domain. We formally prove that this approximation converges to the continuous
case as the mesh approximation converges to the true domain. We demonstrate
that on domains where analytical basis functions are available (plane, sphere),
the proposed method obtains equivalent results, and while on other domains
(torus, bunny, wind turbine), the approach is versatile enough to still search
effectively. Lastly, we also compare with an existing ergodic search technique
that can handle complex domains and show that our method results in a higher
quality exploration.</p>

diffusion to construct a sensor visibility model. This sensor visibility model
is used to repeatedly calculate an expected information distribution (EID) to
be used in the ETO algorithm. Our experiments show that our exploration method
achieves improved information gathering over both baseline search methods and
naive ergodic search formulations.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Trajectory forecasting has become a popular deep learning task due to its
relevance for scenario simulation for autonomous driving. Specifically,
trajectory forecasting predicts the trajectory of a short-horizon future for
specific human drivers in a particular traffic scenario. Robust and accurate
future predictions can enable autonomous driving planners to optimize for
low-risk and predictable outcomes for human drivers around them. Although some
work has been done to model driving style in planning and personalized
autonomous polices, a gap exists in explicitly modeling human driving styles
for trajectory forecasting of human behavior. Human driving style is most
certainly a correlating factor to decision making, especially in edge-case
scenarios where risk is nontrivial, as justified by the large amount of traffic
psychology literature on risky driving. So far, the current real-world datasets
for trajectory forecasting lack insight on the variety of represented driving
styles. While the datasets may represent real-world distributions of driving
styles, we posit that fringe driving style types may also be correlated with
edge-case safety scenarios. In this work, we conduct analyses on existing
real-world trajectory datasets for driving and dissect these works from the
lens of driving styles, which is often intangible and non-standardized.</p>

  Understanding for Airport Surface Movement Collision Risk Assessment</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-06 21:08:07</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This work integrates language AI-based voice communication understanding with
collision risk assessment. The proposed framework consists of two major parts,
(a) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR); (b) surface collision risk modeling.
ASR module generates information tables by processing voice communication
transcripts, which serve as references for producing potential taxi plans and
calculating the surface movement collision risk. For ASR, we collect and
annotate our own Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset based on open-sourced
video recordings and safety investigation reports. Additionally, we refer to
FAA Order JO 7110.65W and FAA Order JO 7340.2N to get the list of heuristic
rules and phase contractions of communication between the pilot and the Air
Traffic Controller (ATCo) used in daily aviation operations. Then, we propose
the novel ATC Rule-Enhanced NER method, which integrates the heuristic rules
into the model training and inference stages, resulting into hybrid rule-based
NER model. We show the effectiveness of this hybrid approach by comparing
different setups with different token-level embedding models. For the risk
modeling, we adopt the node-link airport layout graph from NASA FACET and model
the aircraft taxi speed at each link as a log-normal distribution and derive
the total taxi time distribution. Then, we propose a spatiotemporal formulation
of the risk probability of two aircraft moving across potential collision nodes
during ground movement. We show the effectiveness of our approach by simulating
two case studies, (a) the Henada airport runway collision accident happened in
January 2024; (b) the KATL taxiway collision happened in September 2024. We
show that, by understanding the pilot-ATC communication transcripts and
analyzing surface movement patterns, the proposed model improves airport safety
by providing risk assessment in time.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-06 20:18:01</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We present a hierarchical safe auto-taxiing framework to enhance the
automated ground operations of multiple unmanned aircraft systems (multi-UAS).
The auto-taxiing problem becomes particularly challenging due to (i) unknown
disturbances, such as crosswind affecting the aircraft dynamics, (ii) taxiway
incursions due to unplanned obstacles, and (iii) spatiotemporal conflicts at
the intersections between multiple entry points in the taxiway. To address
these issues, we propose a hierarchical framework, i.e., SAFE-TAXI, combining
centralized spatiotemporal planning with decentralized MPC-CBF-based control to
safely navigate the aircraft through the taxiway while avoiding intersection
conflicts and unplanned obstacles (e.g., other aircraft or ground vehicles).
Our proposed framework decouples the auto-taxiing problem temporally into
conflict resolution and motion planning, respectively. Conflict resolution is
handled in a centralized manner by computing conflict-aware reference
trajectories for each aircraft. In contrast, safety assurance from unplanned
obstacles is handled by an MPC-CBF-based controller implemented in a
decentralized manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
framework through numerical simulations and experimentally validate it using
Night Vapor, a small-scale fixed-wing test platform.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Adapting quickly to dynamic, uncertain environments-often called "open

Planning (TAMP) approaches struggle to cope with unforeseen changes, are
data-inefficient when adapting, and do not leverage world models during
learning. We address this issue with a hybrid planning and learning system that
integrates two models: a low level neural network based model that learns
stochastic transitions and drives exploration via an Intrinsic Curiosity Module
(ICM), and a high level symbolic planning model that captures abstract
transitions using operators, enabling the agent to plan in an "imaginary" space
and generate reward machines. Our evaluation in a robotic manipulation domain
with sequential novelty injections demonstrates that our approach converges

<p class='card-text'>Planning and control for high-dimensional robot manipulators in cluttered,
dynamic environments require both computational efficiency and robust safety
guarantees. Inspired by recent advances in learning configuration-space
distance functions (CDFs) as robot body representations, we propose a unified
framework for motion planning and control that formulates safety constraints as
CDF barriers. A CDF barrier approximates the local free configuration space,
substantially reducing the number of collision-checking operations during
motion planning. However, learning a CDF barrier with a neural network and
relying on online sensor observations introduce uncertainties that must be
considered during control synthesis. To address this, we develop a
distributionally robust CDF barrier formulation for control that explicitly
accounts for modeling errors and sensor noise without assuming a known
underlying distribution. Simulations and hardware experiments on a 6-DoF xArm
manipulator show that our neural CDF barrier formulation enables efficient
planning and robust real-time safe control in cluttered and dynamic
environments, relying only on onboard point-cloud observations.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The evolution of automotive technologies towards more integrated and
sophisticated systems requires a shift from traditional distributed
architectures to centralized vehicle architectures. This work presents a novel
framework that addresses the increasing complexity of Software Defined Vehicles
(SDV) through a centralized approach that optimizes software and hardware
integration. Our approach introduces a scalable, modular, and secure automotive
deployment framework that leverages a hardware abstraction layer and dynamic
software deployment capabilities to meet the growing demands of the industry.
The framework supports centralized computing of vehicle functions, making
software development more dynamic and easier to update and upgrade. We
demonstrate the capabilities of our framework by implementing it in a simulated
environment where it effectively handles several automotive operations such as
lane detection, motion planning, and vehicle control. Our results highlight the
framework's potential to facilitate the development and maintenance of future
vehicles, emphasizing its adaptability to different hardware configurations and
its readiness for real-world applications. This work lays the foundation for
further exploration of robust, scalable, and secure SDV systems, setting a new
standard for future automotive architectures.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-06 16:01:09</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper develops a granular regime-switching framework to model mortality
deviations from seasonal baseline trends driven by temperature and epidemic
shocks. The framework features three states: (1) a baseline state that captures
observed seasonal mortality patterns, (2) an environmental shock state for heat
waves, and (3) a respiratory shock state that addresses mortality deviations
caused by strong outbreaks of respiratory diseases due to influenza and
COVID-19. Transition probabilities between states are modeled using
covariate-dependent multinomial logit functions. These functions incorporate,
among others, lagged temperature and influenza incidence rates as predictors,
allowing dynamic adjustments to evolving shocks. Calibrated on weekly mortality
data across 21 French regions and six age groups, the regime-switching
framework accounts for spatial and demographic heterogeneity. Under various
projection scenarios for temperature and influenza, we quantify uncertainty in
mortality forecasts through prediction intervals constructed using an extensive
bootstrap approach. These projections can guide healthcare providers and
hospitals in managing risks and planning resources for potential future shocks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Epidemics exhibit interconnected processes that operate at multiple time and
organizational scales, a hallmark of complex adaptive systems. Modern
epidemiological modeling frameworks incorporate feedback between
individual-level behavioral choices and centralized interventions. Nonetheless,
the realistic operational course for disease detection, planning, and response
is often overlooked. Disease detection is a dynamic challenge, shaped by the
interplay between surveillance efforts and transmission characteristics. It
serves as a tipping point that triggers emergency declarations, information
dissemination, adaptive behavioral responses, and the deployment of public
health interventions. Evaluating the impact of disease surveillance systems as
triggers for adaptive behavior and public health interventions is key to
designing effective control policies.
  We examine the multiple behavioral and epidemiological dynamics generated by
the feedback between disease surveillance and the intertwined dynamics of
information and disease propagation. Specifically, we study the intertwined
dynamics between: $(i)$ disease surveillance triggering health emergency
declarations, $(ii)$ risk information dissemination producing decentralized
behavioral responses, and $(iii)$ centralized interventions. Our results show
that robust surveillance systems that quickly detect a disease outbreak can
trigger an early response from the population, leading to large epidemic sizes.
The key result is that the response scenarios that minimize the final epidemic
size are determined by the trade-off between the risk information dissemination
and disease transmission, with the triggering effect of surveillance mediating
this trade-off. Finally, our results confirm that behavioral adaptation can
create a hysteresis-like effect on the final epidemic size.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Promoting active mobility like cycling relies on the availability of
well-connected, high-quality bicycle networks. However, expanding these
networks over an extended planning horizon presents one of the most complex
challenges in transport science. This complexity arises from the intricate
interactions between infrastructure availability and usage, such as network
spillover effects and mode choice substitutions. In this paper, we approach the
problem from two perspectives: direct optimization methods, which generate
near-optimal solutions using operations research techniques, and conceptual
heuristics, which offer intuitive and scalable algorithms grounded in network
science. Specifically, we compare direct welfare optimization with an inverse
network percolation approach to planning cycle superhighway extensions in
Copenhagen. Interestingly, while the more complex optimization models yield
better overall welfare results, the improvements over simpler methods are
small. More importantly, we demonstrate that the increased complexity of
planning approaches generally makes them more vulnerable to input uncertainty,
reflecting the bias-variance tradeoff. This issue is particularly relevant in
the context of long-term planning, where conditions change during the
implementation of the planned infrastructure expansions. Therefore, while
planning bicycle infrastructure is important and renders exceptionally high
benefit-cost ratios, considerations of robustness and ease of implementation
may justify the use of more straightforward network-based methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Datasets for object detection often do not account for enough variety of
glasses, due to their transparent and reflective properties. Specifically,
open-vocabulary object detectors, widely used in embodied robotic agents, fail
to distinguish subclasses of glasses. This scientific gap poses an issue to
robotic applications that suffer from accumulating errors between detection,
planning, and action execution. The paper introduces a novel method for the
acquisition of real-world data from RGB-D sensors that minimizes human effort.
We propose an auto-labeling pipeline that generates labels for all the acquired
frames based on the depth measurements. We provide a novel real-world glass

humanoid robot platform. The data set consists of 7850 images recorded from

<p class='card-text'>Magnetic-field simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using
consumer-grade inertial and magnetometer sensors offers a scalable,
cost-effective solution for indoor localization. However, the rapid error
accumulation in the inertial navigation process limits the feasible exploratory
phases of these systems. Advances in magnetometer array processing have
demonstrated that odometry information, i.e., displacement and rotation
information, can be extracted from local magnetic field variations and used to
create magnetic-field odometry-aided inertial navigation systems. The error
growth rate of these systems is significantly lower than that of standalone
inertial navigation systems. This study seeks an answer to whether a
magnetic-field SLAM system fed with measurements from a magnetometer array can
indirectly extract odometry information -- without requiring algorithmic
modifications -- and thus sustain longer exploratory phases. The theoretical
analysis and simulation results show that such a system can extract odometry
information and indirectly create a magnetic field odometry-aided inertial
navigation system during the exploration phases. However, practical challenges
related to map resolution and computational complexity remain significant.</p>
