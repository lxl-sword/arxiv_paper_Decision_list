<p class='card-text'>Spatial Planning is a crucial part in the field of spatial intelligence,
which requires the understanding and planning about object arrangements in
space perspective. AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt
to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic
assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct
benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial
reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers
from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task
execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive
benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability
of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild
requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on
the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial
planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data
collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates
spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial
understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on
MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based
agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their
spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues
for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development
for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Xinhang Liu, Yu-Wing Tai, Chi-Keung Tang</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-26 15:28:17</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by
vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate
structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains
their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive
simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that
enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by
injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal
input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that
provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud
capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich
spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints.
Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware
working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities
with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on
this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which
the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline
features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment
setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene
hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and
challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior
work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs
to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path
planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in
computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-26 14:53:14</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper employs a game-theoretic approach to analyze investment decisions
in Ireland's electricity market. It compares optimal electricity investment
strategies among energy generators under a perfect competition framework with
an imperfect Nash-Cournot competition. The model incorporates market price
based on competition among generators while accounting for the supply capacity
of each firm and each technology, along with the System Non-Synchronous
Penetration (SNSP) constraint to reflect operational limitations in renewable
energy contribution to the power system. Both models are formulated as
single-objective function optimization problems. Furthermore, unit commitment
constraints are introduced to the perfect competition model, allowing the model
to incorporate binary decision variables to capture energy unit scheduling
decisions of online status, startup, and shutdown costs. The proposed models
are evaluated under three different demand test cases, using Ireland's
electricity generation projections for 2023 to 2033. The results highlight key
differences in investment decisions, carbon emissions, and the contribution of
renewable technologies in perfect and imperfect competition structures. The
findings provide managerial insights for policymakers and stakeholders,
supporting optimal investment decisions and generation capacity planning to
achieve Ireland's long-term energy objectives.</p>

<p class='card-text'>High Speed multi-vehicle Autonomous Racing will increase the safety and
performance of road-going Autonomous Vehicles. Precise vehicle detection and
dynamics estimation from a moving platform is a key requirement for planning
and executing complex autonomous overtaking maneuvers. To address this
requirement, we have developed a Latency-Aware EKF-based Multi Target Tracking
algorithm fusing LiDAR and RADAR measurements. The algorithm explots the
different sensor characteristics by explicitly integrating the Range Rate in
the EKF Measurement Function, as well as a-priori knowledge of the racetrack
during state prediction. It can handle Out-Of-Sequence Measurements via
Reprocessing using a double State and Measurement Buffer, ensuring sensor delay
compensation with no information loss. This algorithm has been implemented on
Team PoliMOVE's autonomous racecar, and was proved experimentally by completing
a number of fully autonomous overtaking maneuvers at speeds up to 275 km/h.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Due to the powerful vision-language reasoning and generalization abilities,
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention in
the field of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, their application to
closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have
not shown clear superiority to mainstream E2E imitation learning approaches. In
this work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed
for closed-loop driving through holistic reasoning with a self-supervised Next
Scene Prediction task and supervised Decision Chain-of-Thought process. This
dual mechanism encourages the model to align visual representations with
actionable driving context, while promoting interpretable and causally grounded
decision making. We curate a planning-oriented decision reasoning dataset,
namely PDR, comprising 210k diverse and high-quality samples. Our method
outperforms the mainstream E2E imitation learning method by a large margin of
19% L2 and 16.1 driving score on Bench2Drive benchmark. Furthermore, ReasonPlan
demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on unseen DOS benchmark,
highlighting its adaptability in handling zero-shot corner cases. Code and

<p class='card-text'>Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as the urban heat island
effect and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to
distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale
quantities (e.g., total population or area). However, these approaches suffer
from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect
intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here we use high-resolution
data of urban temperatures, air quality, population counts, and street
intersections from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint
probability distributions follow universal scaling functions. By using a
logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we
show that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the
entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within
and across cities. We further demonstrate that traditional models linking
climate variables to the distance from the city center fail to reproduce the
observed distributions unless the stochasticity of urban structure is fully
considered. These findings provide a unified statistical framework for
characterizing intra-urban climate variability, with important implications for
climate modelling and urban planning.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-26 13:26:15</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recent progress in strengthening the capabilities of large language models
has stemmed from applying reinforcement learning to domains with automatically
verifiable outcomes. A key question is whether we can similarly use RL to
optimize for outcomes in domains where evaluating outcomes inherently requires
human feedback; for example, in tasks like deep research and trip planning,
outcome evaluation is qualitative and there are many possible degrees of
success. One attractive and scalable modality for collecting human feedback is
preference data: ordinal rankings (pairwise or $k$-wise) that indicate, for $k$
given outcomes, which one is preferred. In this work, we study a critical
roadblock: preference data fundamentally and significantly limits outcome-based
optimization. Even with idealized preference data (infinite, noiseless, and
online), the use of ordinal feedback can prevent obtaining even approximately
optimal solutions. We formalize this impossibility using voting theory, drawing
an analogy between how a model chooses to answer a query with how voters choose
a candidate to elect. This indicates that grounded human scoring and
algorithmic innovations are necessary for extending the success of RL
post-training to domains demanding human feedback. We also explore why these
limitations have disproportionately impacted RLHF when it comes to eliciting
reasoning behaviors (e.g., backtracking) versus situations where RLHF has been
historically successful (e.g., instruction-tuning and safety training), finding
that the limitations of preference data primarily suppress RLHF's ability to
elicit robust strategies -- a class that encompasses most reasoning behaviors.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-26 11:50:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>With the recent success of world-model agents, which extend the core idea of
model-based reinforcement learning by learning a differentiable model for
sample-efficient control across diverse tasks, active inference (AIF) offers a
complementary, neuroscience-grounded paradigm that unifies perception,
learning, and action within a single probabilistic framework powered by a
generative model. Despite this promise, practical AIF agents still rely on
accurate immediate predictions and exhaustive planning, a limitation that is
exacerbated in delayed environments requiring plans over long horizons, tens to
hundreds of steps. Moreover, most existing agents are evaluated on robotic or
vision benchmarks which, while natural for biological agents, fall short of
real-world industrial complexity. We address these limitations with a
generative-policy architecture featuring (i) a multi-step latent transition
that lets the generative model predict an entire horizon in a single
look-ahead, (ii) an integrated policy network that enables the transition and
receives gradients of the expected free energy, (iii) an alternating
optimization scheme that updates model and policy from a replay buffer, and
(iv) a single gradient step that plans over long horizons, eliminating
exhaustive planning from the control loop. We evaluate our agent in an
environment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario with delayed and
long-horizon settings. The empirical results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, demonstrating the coupled world-model with the AIF formalism
yields an end-to-end probabilistic controller capable of effective decision
making in delayed, long-horizon settings without handcrafted rewards or
expensive planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Understanding pain-related facial behaviors is essential for digital
healthcare in terms of effective monitoring, assisted diagnostics, and

Existing data-driven methods of detecting pain from facial expressions are
limited due to interpretability and severity quantification. To this end, we
propose GraphAU-Pain, leveraging a graph-based framework to model facial Action
Units (AUs) and their interrelationships for pain intensity estimation. AUs are
represented as graph nodes, with co-occurrence relationships as edges, enabling
a more expressive depiction of pain-related facial behaviors. By utilizing a
relational graph neural network, our framework offers improved interpretability

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-26 09:25:58</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Electrical grid congestion has emerged as an immense challenge in Europe,
making the forecasting of load and its associated metrics increasingly crucial.
Among these metrics, peak load is fundamental. Non-time-resolved models of peak
load have their advantages of being simple and compact, and among them
Velander's formula (VF) is widely used in distribution network planning.
However, several aspects of VF remain inadequately addressed, including
year-ahead prediction, scaling of customers, aggregation, and, most
importantly, the lack of probabilistic elements. The present paper proposes a
quantile interpretation of VF that enables VF to learn truncated cumulative
distribution functions of peak loads with multiple quantile regression under
non-crossing constraints. The evaluations on non-residential customer data
confirmed its ability to predict peak load year ahead, to fit customers with a
wide range of electricity consumptions, and to model aggregations of customers.
A noteworthy finding is that for a given electricity consumption, aggregations
of customers have statistically larger peak loads than a single customer.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-26 08:49:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Reactive intelligence remains one of the cornerstones of versatile robotics
operating in cluttered, dynamic, and human-centred environments. Among reactive
approaches, potential fields (PF) continue to be widely adopted due to their
simplicity and real-time applicability. However, existing PF methods typically
oversimplify environmental representations by relying on isotropic, point- or
sphere-based obstacle approximations. In human-centred settings, this
simplification results in overly conservative paths, cumbersome tuning, and
computational overhead -- even breaking real-time requirements. In response, we
propose the Geometric Potential Field (GeoPF), a reactive motion-planning
framework that explicitly infuses geometric primitives - points, lines, planes,
cubes, and cylinders - into real-time planning. By leveraging precise
closed-form distance functions, GeoPF significantly reduces computational
complexity and parameter tuning effort. Extensive quantitative analyses
consistently show GeoPF's higher success rates, reduced tuning complexity (a
single parameter set across experiments), and substantially lower computational
costs (up to 2 orders of magnitude) compared to traditional PF methods.
Real-world experiments further validate GeoPF's robustness and practical ease
of deployment. GeoPF provides a fresh perspective on reactive planning problems
driving geometric-aware temporal motion generation, enabling flexible and
low-latency motion planning suitable for modern robotic applications.</p>

unified \textit{confidence-aware} framework for estimating ratio-based

segmentation-to-biomarker pipeline and identify model miscalibration as the
dominant source of uncertainty. To mitigate this, we incorporate a lightweight,
post-hoc calibration module that can be applied using internal hospital data
without retraining. We leverage a tunable parameter $Q$ to control the

addresses the challenge of rapidly changing tire-surface interactions. Unlike
existing approaches requiring substantial data collection or offline training,
LLA-MPC employs a model bank for immediate adaptation without a learning

recent vehicle behavior to select the most accurate model and a look-ahead
horizon that optimizes trajectory planning based on the identified dynamics.
The selected model and estimated friction coefficient are then incorporated
into a trajectory planner to optimize reference paths in real-time. Experiments

<p class='card-text'>This paper presents an integrated approach for efficient path planning and
energy management in hybrid unmanned aerial vehicles (HUAVs) equipped with dual
fuel-electric propulsion systems. These HUAVs operate in environments that
include noise-restricted zones, referred to as quiet zones, where only electric
mode is permitted. We address the problem by parameterizing the position of a
point along the side of the quiet zone using its endpoints and a scalar
parameter, transforming the problem into a variant of finding the shortest path
over a graph of convex sets. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer
convex program (MICP), which can be efficiently solved using commercial
solvers. Additionally, a tight lower bound can be obtained by relaxing the
path-selection variable. Through extensive computations across 200 instances
over four maps, we show a substantial improvement in computational efficiency
over a state-of-the-art method, achieving up to a 100-fold and 10-fold decrease
in computation time for calculating the lower bound and the exact solution,
respectively. Moreover, the average gap between the exact cost and the lower
bound was approximately 0.24%, and the exact cost was 1.05% lower than the
feasible solution from the state-of-the-art approach on average, highlighting
the effectiveness of our method. We also extend our approach to plan the HUAV
route to visit a set of targets and return to its starting location in
environments with quiet zones, yielding a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We
employ two methodologies to solve the TSP: one where the SOC at each target is
discretized, and another where it is assumed to be the minimum allowable level
upon departure. A comparative analysis reveals the second method achieves a

of billions of dollars in damage annually and posing growing threats to
infrastructure and human livelihoods. Accurate data on roofing materials is
critical for modeling building vulnerability to natural hazards such as
earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and hurricanes, yet such data remain

geographically diverse novel multimodal dataset to date, comprising over 51,500
samples from 184 geographically diverse sites pairing high-resolution Earth
Observation (EO) imagery with curated text annotations for global roof material
classification. RoofNet includes geographically diverse satellite imagery
labeled with 14 key roofing types -- such as asphalt shingles, clay tiles, and
metal sheets -- and is designed to enhance the fidelity of global exposure
datasets through vision-language modeling (VLM). We sample EO tiles from
climatically and architecturally distinct regions to construct a representative
dataset. A subset of 6,000 images was annotated in collaboration with domain
experts to fine-tune a VLM. We used geographic- and material-aware prompt
tuning to enhance class separability. The fine-tuned model was then applied to
the remaining EO tiles, with predictions refined through rule-based and
human-in-the-loop verification. In addition to material labels, RoofNet
provides rich metadata including roof shape, footprint area, solar panel
presence, and indicators of mixed roofing materials (e.g., HVAC systems).
RoofNet supports scalable, AI-driven risk assessment and serves as a downstream

<p class='card-text'>To address the gaps between the static pre-set "thinking-planning-action" of
humanoid robots in unfamiliar scenarios and the highly programmed "call
tool-return result" due to the lack of autonomous coding capabilities, this
work designs a dynamic architecture connecting continuous thought machines
(CTM) and model context protocol (MCP). It proposes a theoretical parallel
solution through tick-slab and uses rank compression to achieve parameter
suppression to provide a solution for achieving autonomous actions due to
autonomous coding. The researcher used a simulation-based experiment using
OpenAI's o4-mini-high as a tool to build the experimental environment, and
introduced the extended SayCan dataset to conduct nine epochs of experiments.
The experimental results show that the CTM-MCP architecture is feasible and
effective through the data results of seven metrics: task success rate (TSR),
execution success rate (ESR), average episode length (AEL), ROSCOE, REVEAL,
proficiency self-assessment (PSA), task effectiveness (TE). In practice, it
provides a reference experience for exploring the autonomous dynamic coding of
humanoid robots based on continuous thinking to achieve human-like autonomous
actions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In the evolving digital landscape, it is crucial to study the dynamics of
cyberattacks and defences. This study uses an Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)
framework to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of attacks and defences in
cyberspace. We develop a two-population asymmetric game between attacker and
defender to capture the essential factors of costs, potential benefits, and the
probability of successful defences. Through mathematical analysis and numerical
simulations, we find that systems with high defence intensities show stability
with minimal attack frequencies, whereas low-defence environments show
instability, and are vulnerable to attacks. Furthermore, we find five
equilibria, where the strategy pair always defend and attack emerged as the
most likely stable state as cyber domain is characterised by a continuous
battle between defenders and attackers. Our theoretical findings align with
real-world data from past cyber incidents, demonstrating the interdisciplinary
impact, such as fraud detection, risk management and cybersecurity
decision-making. Overall, our analysis suggests that adaptive cybersecurity
strategies based on EGT can improve resource allocation, enhance system
resilience, and reduce the overall risk of cyberattacks. By incorporating
real-world data, this study demonstrates the applicability of EGT in addressing
the evolving nature of cyber threats and the need for secure digital ecosystems
through strategic planning and proactive defence measures.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in artificial
intelligence and robotics, requiring the computation of collision-free paths
for multiple agents navigating from their start locations to designated goals.
As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in warehouses, urban
transportation, and other complex environments, MAPF has evolved from a
theoretical challenge to a critical enabler of real-world multi-robot
coordination. This comprehensive survey bridges the long-standing divide
between classical algorithmic approaches and emerging learning-based methods in
MAPF research. We present a unified framework that encompasses search-based
methods (including Conflict-Based Search, Priority-Based Search, and Large
Neighborhood Search), compilation-based approaches (SAT, SMT, CSP, ASP, and MIP
formulations), and data-driven techniques (reinforcement learning, supervised
learning, and hybrid strategies). Through systematic analysis of experimental
practices across 200+ papers, we uncover significant disparities in evaluation
methodologies, with classical methods typically tested on larger-scale
instances (up to 200 by 200 grids with 1000+ agents) compared to learning-based
approaches (predominantly 10-100 agents). We provide a comprehensive taxonomy
of evaluation metrics, environment types, and baseline selections, highlighting
the need for standardized benchmarking protocols. Finally, we outline promising
future directions including mixed-motive MAPF with game-theoretic
considerations, language-grounded planning with large language models, and
neural solver architectures that combine the rigor of classical methods with
the flexibility of deep learning. This survey serves as both a comprehensive
reference for researchers and a practical guide for deploying MAPF solutions in
increasingly complex real-world applications.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Optimal Transport (OT) is a resource allocation problem with applications in
biology, data science, economics and statistics, among others. In some of the
applications, practitioners have access to samples which approximate the

maps and costs -- are only available in their empirical versions. Statistical
inference on OT aims at finding confidence intervals of the population plans,
maps and costs. In recent years this topic gained an increasing interest in the
statistical community. In this paper we provide a comprehensive review of the

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-25 11:23:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In this work, we introduce SPADE, a path planning framework designed for
autonomous navigation in dynamic environments using 3D scene graphs. SPADE
combines hierarchical path planning with local geometric awareness to enable
collision-free movement in dynamic scenes. The framework bifurcates the
planning problem into two: (a) solving the sparse abstract global layer plan
and (b) iterative path refinement across denser lower local layers in step with
local geometric scene navigation. To ensure efficient extraction of a feasible
route in a dense multi-task domain scene graphs, the framework enforces
informed sampling of traversable edges prior to path-planning. This removes
extraneous information not relevant to path-planning and reduces the overall
planning complexity over a graph. Existing approaches address the problem of
path planning over scene graphs by decoupling hierarchical and geometric path
evaluation processes. Specifically, this results in an inefficient replanning
over the entire scene graph when encountering path obstructions blocking the
original route. In contrast, SPADE prioritizes local layer planning coupled
with local geometric scene navigation, enabling navigation through dynamic
scenes while maintaining efficiency in computing a traversable route. We
validate SPADE through extensive simulation experiments and real-world
deployment on a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating its efficacy in handling
complex and dynamic scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly applied to real-world problems
involving complex and structured decisions, such as routing, scheduling, and
assortment planning. These settings challenge standard RL algorithms, which
struggle to scale, generalize, and exploit structure in the presence of
combinatorial action spaces. We propose Structured Reinforcement Learning
(SRL), a novel actor-critic framework that embeds combinatorial optimization
layers into the actor neural network. We enable end-to-end learning of the
actor via Fenchel-Young losses and provide a geometric interpretation of SRL as
a primal-dual algorithm in the dual of the moment polytope. Across six
environments with exogenous and endogenous uncertainty, SRL matches or
surpasses the performance of unstructured RL and imitation learning on static
tasks and improves over these baselines by up to 92% on dynamic problems, with
improved stability and convergence speed.</p>

  Liver Tumours</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Catalina Tan, Yipeng Hu, Shaheer U. Saeed</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-25 06:14:41</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Accurate tumour segmentation is vital for various targeted diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures for cancer, e.g., planning biopsies or tumour ablations.
Manual delineation is extremely labour-intensive, requiring substantial expert
time. Fully-supervised machine learning models aim to automate such
localisation tasks, but require a large number of costly and often subjective
3D voxel-level labels for training. The high-variance and subjectivity in such
labels impacts model generalisability, even when large datasets are available.
Histopathology labels may offer more objective labels but the infeasibility of
acquiring pixel-level annotations to develop tumour localisation methods based
on histology remains challenging in-vivo. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised semantic segmentation framework called SPARS (Self-Play
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Segmentation), which utilises an object
presence classifier, trained on a small number of image-level binary cancer
presence labels, to localise cancerous regions on CT scans. Such binary labels
of patient-level cancer presence can be sourced more feasibly from biopsies and
histopathology reports, enabling a more objective cancer localisation on
medical images. Evaluating with real patient data, we observed that SPARS
yielded a mean dice score of $77.3 \pm 9.4$, which outperformed other
weakly-supervised methods by large margins. This performance was comparable
with recent fully-supervised methods that require voxel-level annotations. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using SPARS to reduce the need for
extensive human-annotated labels to detect cancer in real-world healthcare
settings.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-25 02:44:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems suffer from a critical
limitation: their planners lack mechanisms to enforce temporal consistency
between predicted trajectories and evolving scene dynamics. This absence of
self-supervision allows early prediction errors to compound catastrophically
over time. We introduce Echo Planning, a novel self-correcting framework that
establishes a closed-loop Current - Future - Current (CFC) cycle to harmonize
trajectory prediction with scene coherence. Our key insight is that plausible
future trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, ie, not only generated
from current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC
mechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
scene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate
the current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and
reconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework
intrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories.
Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing L2
error by 0.04 m and collision rate by 0.12% compared to one-shot planners.
Crucially, our method requires no additional supervision, leveraging the CFC
cycle as an inductive bias for robust planning. This work offers a deployable
solution for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This report describes an extension of the distributed job scheduling and SAT
solving platform Mallob by incremental SAT solving, embedded in a case study on
SAT-based hierarchical planning. We introduce a low-latency interface for

parallel via Mallob's scheduling capabilities. In an experiment where 587
planning inputs are resolved in parallel on 2348 cores, we observe significant
speedups for several planning domains where SAT solving constitutes a major
part of the planner's running time. These findings indicate that our approach

<p class='card-text'>Wind-wave and ocean current interactions affect critical coastal and oceanic
processes, yet modeling these interactions presents significant challenges. The
western North Atlantic Ocean provides an ideal test environment for coupled
hydrodynamics and wind wave models, thanks to its energetic surface currents
such as the Gulf Stream. This study evaluates a high-resolution coupled SCHISM
WWM III model, utilizing NOAA's 'STOFS-3D-Atlantic' computational mesh, while
incorporating three-dimensional baroclinic dynamics to account for density
stratification effects. We evaluate the model's calculated water level and
tidal predictions against NOAA tide gauge measurements during December 2016.
The coupled model demonstrates robust skills in reproducing tidal constituents,
non-tidal components, and total water level predictions along the U.S. East and
Gulf of Mexico Coasts. In addition, we systematically evaluate three wave
physics parameterizations (Ardhuin, Makin and Stam, and Cycle Three) in the
spectral wave model to quantify their effects on the modeled wave
characteristics. This validated modeling framework enhances our ability to
understand and predict complex coastal and oceanic processes, offering
significant applications for coastal management, maritime operations, and
climate adaptation planning throughout the western North Atlantic region.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Efficient tabletop rearrangement planning seeks to find high-quality
solutions while minimizing total cost. However, the task is challenging due to
object dependencies and limited buffer space for temporary placements. The
complexity increases for mobile robots, which must navigate around the table
with restricted access. A*-based methods yield high-quality solutions, but
struggle to scale as the number of objects increases. Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) has been introduced as an anytime algorithm, but its convergence speed
to high-quality solutions remains slow. Previous work~\cite{strap2024}
accelerated convergence but required the robot to move to the closest position
to the object for each pick and place operation, leading to inefficiencies. To
address these limitations, we extend the planner by introducing a more
efficient strategy for mobile robots. Instead of selecting the nearest
available location for each action, our approach allows multiple operations
(e.g., pick-and-place) from a single standing position, reducing unnecessary
movement. Additionally, we incorporate state re-exploration to further improve
plan quality. Experimental results show that our planner outperforms existing
planners both in terms of solution quality and planning time.</p>

Only Plan Once) end-to-end navigation framework to off-road environments,
explicitly focusing on forest terrains, consisting of a high-performance,
multi-sensor supported off-road simulator YOPO-Sim, a zero-shot transfer
sim-to-real planner YOPO-Rally, and an MPC controller. Built on the Unity
engine, the simulator can generate randomized forest environments and export
depth images and point cloud maps for expert demonstrations, providing
competitive performance with mainstream simulators. Terrain Traversability
Analysis (TTA) processes cost maps, generating expert trajectories represented
as non-uniform cubic Hermite curves. The planner integrates TTA and the
pathfinding into a single neural network that inputs the depth image, current
velocity, and the goal vector, and outputs multiple trajectory candidates with
costs. The planner is trained by behavior cloning in the simulator and deployed
directly into the real-world without fine-tuning. Finally, a series of

<p class='card-text'>Modeling human mobility across diverse cities is essential for applications
such as urban planning, transportation optimization, and personalized services.
However, generalization remains challenging due to heterogeneous spatial
representations and mobility patterns across cities. Existing methods typically
rely on numerical coordinates or require training city-specific models,
limiting their scalability and transferability. We propose TrajMoE, a unified
and scalable model for cross-city human mobility modeling. TrajMoE addresses
two key challenges: (1) inconsistent spatial semantics across cities, and (2)
diverse urban mobility patterns. To tackle these, we begin by designing a
spatial semantic encoder that learns transferable location representations from
POI-based functional semantics and visit patterns. Furthermore, we design a
Spatially-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (SAMoE) Transformer that injects structured
priors into experts specialized in distinct mobility semantics, along with a
shared expert to capture city-invariant patterns and enable adaptive cross-city
generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajMoE achieves up to
27% relative improvement over competitive mobility foundation models after only
one epoch of fine-tuning, and consistently outperforms full-data baselines
using merely 5% of target city data. These results establish TrajMoE as a
significant step toward realizing a truly generalizable, transferable, and
pretrainable foundation model for human mobility.</p>
