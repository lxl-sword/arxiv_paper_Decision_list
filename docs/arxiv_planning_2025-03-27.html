<p class='card-text'>Aerial robotic arms aim to enable inspection and environment interaction in
otherwise hard-to-reach areas from the air. However, many aerial manipulators
feature bulky or heavy robot manipulators mounted to large, high-payload aerial
vehicles. Instead, we propose an aerial robotic arm with low mass and a small
stowed configuration called a "flying vine". The flying vine consists of a
small, maneuverable quadrotor equipped with a soft, growing, inflated beam as
the arm. This soft robot arm is underactuated, and positioning of the end
effector is achieved by controlling the coupled quadrotor-vine dynamics. In
this work, we present the flying vine design and a modeling and control
framework for tracking desired end effector trajectories. The dynamic model
leverages data-driven modeling methods and introduces bilinear interpolation to
account for time-varying dynamic parameters. We use trajectory optimization to
plan quadrotor controls that produce desired end effector motions. Experimental
results on a physical prototype demonstrate that our framework enables the
flying vine to perform high-speed end effector tracking, laying a foundation
for performing dynamic maneuvers with soft aerial manipulators.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate segmentation of nodules in both 2D breast ultrasound (BUS) and 3D
automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is crucial for clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning. Therefore, developing an automated system for nodule
segmentation can enhance user independence and expedite clinical analysis.
Unlike fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can
streamline the laborious and intricate annotation process. However, current WSS
methods face challenges in achieving precise nodule segmentation, as many of
them depend on inaccurate activation maps or inefficient pseudo-mask generation
algorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement
learning-based WSS framework called Flip Learning, which relies solely on 2D/3D
boxes for accurate segmentation. Specifically, multiple agents are employed to
erase the target from the box to facilitate classification tag flipping, with
the erased region serving as the predicted segmentation mask. The key
contributions of this research are as follows: (1) Adoption of a
superpixel/supervoxel-based approach to encode the standardized environment,
capturing boundary priors and expediting the learning process. (2) Introduction
of three meticulously designed rewards, comprising a classification score
reward and two intensity distribution rewards, to steer the agents' erasing
process precisely, thereby avoiding both under- and over-segmentation. (3)
Implementation of a progressive curriculum learning strategy to enable agents
to interact with the environment in a progressively challenging manner, thereby
enhancing learning efficiency. Extensively validated on the large in-house BUS
and ABUS datasets, our Flip Learning method outperforms state-of-the-art WSS
methods and foundation models, and achieves comparable performance as
fully-supervised learning algorithms.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Ensuring robustness against epistemic, possibly adversarial, perturbations is
essential for reliable real-world decision-making. While the Probabilistic
Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling (PETS) algorithm inherently handles
uncertainty via ensemble-based probabilistic models, it lacks guarantees
against structured adversarial or worst-case uncertainty distributions. To
address this, we propose DR-PETS, a distributionally robust extension of PETS
that certifies robustness against adversarial perturbations. We formalize
uncertainty via a p-Wasserstein ambiguity set, enabling worst-case-aware
planning through a min-max optimization framework. While PETS passively
accounts for stochasticity, DR-PETS actively optimizes robustness via a
tractable convex approximation integrated into PETS planning loop. Experiments
on pendulum stabilization and cart-pole balancing show that DR-PETS certifies
robustness against adversarial parameter perturbations, achieving consistent
performance in worst-case scenarios where PETS deteriorates.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The rapid growth of photovoltaic (PV) systems in Austria's medium- and
low-voltage grids has intensified challenges in grid access, with technical
limits increasingly leading to restrictions on full feed-in power. This issue
has sparked discussions about limiting PV feed-in power and the implications
for both generated and curtailed PV energy. At the same time, expanding PV
capacity remains critical to achieving future climate targets. However, there
is a lack of robust methodologies of quantify the impact of PV feed-in
limitations when implemented in an optimization model. This impact affects both
the curtailed energy and the increase in maximum PV installation capacity and
total energy production. To address this gap, we have developed a mathematical
formulation of dynamic PV feed-in limitations and integrated it into an
optimization model. This approach enables a comprehensive evaluation of its
effects on PV integration potential and energy curtailment, validated through
case studies on four representative real-world Austrian medium- and low-voltage
grids. We analyzed maximum PV expansion, energy generation, and curtailment
under feed-in constraints. The results highlight the potential for integrating
up to 32% additional PV systems within existing infrastructure while keeping PV
curtailment relatively low, i.e. at 2%. We provide actionable insights for grid
operators and policymakers aiming to balance renewable energy expansion with
grid reliability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper considers multi-goal motion planning in unstructured,
obstacle-rich environments where a robot is required to reach multiple regions
while avoiding collisions. The planned motions must also satisfy the
differential constraints imposed by the robot dynamics. To find solutions
efficiently, this paper leverages machine learning, Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP), and sampling-based motion planning. The approach expands a motion tree
by adding collision-free and dynamically-feasible trajectories as branches. A
TSP solver is used to compute a tour for each node to determine the order in
which to reach the remaining goals by utilizing a cost matrix. An important
aspect of the approach is that it leverages machine learning to construct the
cost matrix by combining runtime and distance predictions to single-goal
motion-planning problems. During the motion-tree expansion, priority is given
to nodes associated with low-cost tours. Experiments with a vehicle model
operating in obstacle-rich environments demonstrate the computational
efficiency and scalability of the approach.</p>

<p class='card-text'>[Abridged] SFGs are the dominant population in the faint radio sky,
corresponding to flux densities at 1.4 GHz $< 0.1$ mJy. A panchromatic approach
is essential for selecting SFGs in the radio band and understanding star
formation processes over cosmic time. Semi-empirical models are valuable tools
to effectively study galaxy formation and evolution, relying on minimal
assumptions and exploiting empirical relations between galaxy properties and
enabling us to take full advantage of the recent progress in radio and
optical/near-infrared (NIR) observations. In this paper, we develop the
Semi-EMPirical model for Extragalactic Radio emission (SEMPER) to predict radio
luminosity functions and number counts at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz for SFGs. SEMPER
is based on state-of-the-art empirical relations and combines the
redshift-dependent galaxy stellar mass functions obtained from the recent
COSMOS2020 catalogue, which exploits deep near-infrared observations, with
up-to-date observed scaling relations, such as the galaxy main sequence and the
mass-dependent far-infrared/radio correlation across cosmic time. Our
luminosity functions are compared with recent observational determinations from
several radio telescopes, along with previous semi-empirical models and
simulations. Our semi-empirical model successfully reproduces the observed
luminosity functions at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz up to $z\sim 5$ and the most recent
number count statistics from radio observations in the LoTSS deep fields. Our
model, based on galaxies selected in the NIR, naturally predicts the presence
of radio-selected massive and/or dust-obscured galaxies already in place at
high redshift ($z\gtrsim3.5$), as suggested by recent results from JWST. Our
predictions offer an excellent benchmark for upcoming updates from JWST and
future ultra-deep radio surveys planned with the SKA and its precursors.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Most, if not all, robot navigation systems employ a decomposed planning
framework that includes global and local planning. To trade-off onboard
computation and plan quality, current systems have to limit all robot dynamics
considerations only within the local planner, while leveraging an extremely
simplified robot representation (e.g., a point-mass holonomic model without
dynamics) in the global level. However, such an artificial decomposition based
on either full or zero consideration of robot dynamics can lead to gaps between
the two levels, e.g., a global path based on a holonomic point-mass model may
not be realizable by a non-holonomic robot, especially in highly constrained
obstacle environments. Motivated by such a limitation, we propose a novel
paradigm, Decremental Dynamics Planning that integrates dynamic constraints
into the entire planning process, with a focus on high-fidelity dynamics
modeling at the beginning and a gradual fidelity reduction as the planning
progresses. To validate the effectiveness of this paradigm, we augment three
different planners with DDP and show overall improved planning performance. We
also develop a new DDP-based navigation system, which achieves first place in
the simulation phase of the 2025 BARN Challenge. Both simulated and physical
experiments validate DDP's hypothesized benefits.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Hybrid storage systems (HSS) combine multiple storage devices with diverse
characteristics to achieve high performance and capacity at low cost. The
performance of an HSS highly depends on the effectiveness of two key policies:
(1) the data-placement policy, which determines the best-fit storage device for
incoming data, and (2) the data-migration policy, which rearranges stored data
across the devices to sustain high HSS performance. Prior works focus on
improving only data placement or only data migration in HSS, which leads to
sub-optimal HSS performance. Unfortunately, no prior work tries to optimize
both policies together. Our goal is to design a holistic data-management
technique for HSS that optimizes both data-placement and data-migration
policies to fully exploit the potential of an HSS. We propose Harmonia, a
multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based data-management technique that
employs two light-weight autonomous RL agents, a data-placement agent and a
data-migration agent, which adapt their policies for the current workload and
HSS configuration, and coordinate with each other to improve overall HSS
performance. We evaluate Harmonia on a real HSS with up to four heterogeneous
storage devices with diverse characteristics. Our evaluation using 17
data-intensive workloads on performance-optimized (cost-optimized) HSS with two
storage devices shows that, on average, Harmonia (1) outperforms the
best-performing prior approach by 49.5% (31.7%), (2) bridges the performance
gap between the best-performing prior work and Oracle by 64.2% (64.3%). On an
HSS with three (four) devices, Harmonia outperforms the best-performing prior
work by 37.0% (42.0%). Harmonia's performance benefits come with low latency
(240ns for inference) and storage overheads (206 KiB for both RL agents
together). We plan to open-source Harmonia's implementation to aid future
research on HSS.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper addresses a generalization problem of Multi-Agent Pathfinding
(MAPF), called Collaborative Task Sequencing - Multi-Agent Pathfinding
(CTS-MAPF), where agents must plan collision-free paths and visit a series of
intermediate task locations in a specific order before reaching their final
destinations. To address this problem, we propose a new approach, Collaborative
Task Sequencing - Conflict-Based Search (CTS-CBS), which conducts a two-level
search. In the high level, it generates a search forest, where each tree
corresponds to a joint task sequence derived from the jTSP solution. In the low
level, CTS-CBS performs constrained single-agent path planning to generate
paths for each agent while adhering to high-level constraints. We also provide
heoretical guarantees of its completeness and optimality (or sub-optimality
with a bounded parameter). To evaluate the performance of CTS-CBS, we create
two datasets, CTS-MAPF and MG-MAPF, and conduct comprehensive experiments. The
results show that CTS-CBS adaptations for MG-MAPF outperform baseline
algorithms in terms of success rate (up to 20 times larger) and runtime (up to
100 times faster), with less than a 10% sacrifice in solution quality.
Furthermore, CTS-CBS offers flexibility by allowing users to adjust the
sub-optimality bound omega to balance between solution quality and efficiency.
Finally, practical robot tests demonstrate the algorithm's applicability in
real-world scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has demonstrated superior sample
efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). However, the
presence of inaccurate models can introduce biases during policy learning,
resulting in misleading trajectories. The challenge lies in obtaining accurate
models due to limited diverse training data, particularly in regions with
limited visits (uncertain regions). Existing approaches passively quantify
uncertainty after sample generation, failing to actively collect uncertain
samples that could enhance state coverage and improve model accuracy. Moreover,
MBRL often faces difficulties in making accurate multi-step predictions,
thereby impacting overall performance. To address these limitations, we propose
a novel framework for uncertainty-aware policy optimization with model-based
exploratory planning. In the model-based planning phase, we introduce an
uncertainty-aware k-step lookahead planning approach to guide action selection
at each step. This process involves a trade-off analysis between model
uncertainty and value function approximation error, effectively enhancing
policy performance. In the policy optimization phase, we leverage an
uncertainty-driven exploratory policy to actively collect diverse training

<p class='card-text'>Reactive mobile robot navigation in unstructured environments is challenging
when robots encounter unexpected obstacles that invalidate previously planned
trajectories. Model predictive path integral control (MPPI) enables reactive
planning, but still suffers from limited prediction horizons that lead to local
minima traps near obstacles. Current solutions rely on heuristic cost design or
scenario-specific pre-training, which often limits their adaptability to new
environments. We introduce dynamic repulsive potential augmented MPPI
(DRPA-MPPI), which dynamically detects potential entrapments on the predicted
trajectories. Upon detecting local minima, DRPA-MPPI automatically switches
between standard goal-oriented optimization and a modified cost function that
generates repulsive forces away from local minima. Comprehensive testing in
simulated obstacle-rich environments confirms DRPA-MPPI's superior navigation

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous vehicle (AV) control systems increasingly rely on ML models for
tasks such as perception and planning. Current practice is to run these models
on the car's local hardware due to real-time latency constraints and
reliability concerns, which limits model size and thus accuracy. Prior work has
observed that we could augment current systems by running larger models in the
cloud, relying on faster cloud runtimes to offset the cellular network latency.
However, prior work does not account for an important practical constraint:
limited cellular bandwidth. We show that, for typical bandwidth levels,
proposed techniques for cloud-augmented AV models take too long to transfer
data, thus mostly falling back to the on-car models and resulting in no
accuracy improvement.
  In this work, we show that realizing cloud-augmented AV models requires
intelligent use of this scarce bandwidth, i.e. carefully allocating bandwidth
across tasks and providing multiple data compression and model options. We
formulate this as a resource allocation problem to maximize car utility, and
present our system \sysname which achieves an increase in average model
accuracy by up to 15 percentage points on driving scenarios from the Waymo Open
Dataset.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in complex environments, such as video games. However, they still
fall short of achieving human-like sample efficiency and adaptability when
learning new domains. Theory-based reinforcement learning (TBRL) is an
algorithmic framework specifically designed to address this gap. Modeled on
cognitive theories, TBRL leverages structured, causal world models - "theories"
- as forward simulators for use in planning, generalization and exploration.
Although current TBRL systems provide compelling explanations of how humans
learn to play video games, they face several technical limitations: their
theory languages are restrictive, and their planning algorithms are not
scalable. To address these challenges, we introduce TheoryCoder, an
instantiation of TBRL that exploits hierarchical representations of theories
and efficient program synthesis methods for more powerful learning and
planning. TheoryCoder equips agents with general-purpose abstractions (e.g.,
"move to"), which are then grounded in a particular environment by learning a
low-level transition model (a Python program synthesized from observations by a
large language model). A bilevel planning algorithm can exploit this
hierarchical structure to solve large domains. We demonstrate that this
approach can be successfully applied to diverse and challenging grid-world
games, where approaches based on directly synthesizing a policy perform poorly.
Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of using hierarchical abstractions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The planned NASA Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) flagship mission aims to
image and spectroscopically characterise 25 Earth-size planets in the habitable
zones of their stars. However, one giant planet in the habitable zone can ruin
your whole day. Recent work has examined the current state of our knowledge on
the presence or absence of such objects in samples of likely HWO targets, and
that knowledge has been found wanting; even Saturn-mass planets remain
undetectable in many of these systems. In this work, we present simulations
assessing the degree to which new campaigns of high-cadence radial velocity
observations can ameliorate this woeful state of affairs. In particular, we
highlight the value of moderate-precision but highly flexibly-scheduled RV
facilities in aiding this necessary HWO precursor science. We find that for a
subset of Southern HWO stars, 6 years of new RVs from the Minerva-Australis
telescope array in Australia can improve the median detection sensitivity in
the habitable zones of 13 likely HWO targets to $\sim$50 Earth masses, an
improvement of $\sim$44%.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Urban transportation networks are vital for the efficient movement of people
and goods, necessitating effective traffic management and planning. An integral
part of traffic management is understanding the turning movement counts (TMCs)
at intersections, Accurate TMCs at intersections are crucial for traffic signal
control, congestion mitigation, and road safety. In general, TMCs are obtained
using physical sensors installed at intersections, but this approach can be
cost-prohibitive and technically challenging, especially for cities with
extensive road networks. Recent advancements in machine learning and
data-driven approaches have offered promising alternatives for estimating TMCs.
Traffic patterns can vary significantly across different intersections due to
factors such as road geometry, traffic signal settings, and local driver
behaviors. This domain discrepancy limits the generalizability and accuracy of
machine learning models when applied to new or unseen intersections. In
response to these limitations, this research proposes a novel framework
leveraging domain adaptation (DA) to estimate TMCs at intersections by using
traffic controller event-based data, road infrastructure data, and
point-of-interest (POI) data. Evaluated on 30 intersections in Tucson, Arizona,
the performance of the proposed DA framework was compared with state-of-the-art
models and achieved the lowest values in terms of Mean Absolute Error and Root
Mean Square Error.</p>

shorter ones. HM-Diffuser trains on these extended trajectories using a

  Cost-sharing Among Deductible Plan Enrollees</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Kris Wain, Debra P Ritzwoller, Marcelo Coca Perraillon</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-25 18:22:25</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Health plan deductibles are a form of cost-sharing that require patients to
pay out-of-pocket before insurance pays for benefits. Deductible plans have
become increasingly common in the United Sates to mitigate escalating
healthcare costs. Quantifying the impact of increased cost-sharing from
deductibles on utilization is a challenging empirical question because
individuals and employers self-select into plans with deductibles. We evaluated
the impact of cost-sharing in plans with deductibles by leveraging an
accidental injury to a family member as an instrumental variable that strongly
predicted the non-injured family member reaching their deductible maximum,
which resulted in a reduction in cost-sharing. Our outcome measures examined
utilization subject to cost-sharing as compared to utilization exempt from
cost-sharing. Using data from the same healthcare system to control for quality
and provider network, we found that reaching the deductible increased emergency
department (ED) utilization by 10.0 percentage points (pp). Nearly one-quarter
of the increased ED utilization was potentially avoidable. Wellness visits not
subject to cost-sharing decreased by 5.7 pp. Results were similar for
high-deductible plans and for families meeting their maximum out-of-pocket
amount. These findings provide causal evidence that individuals enrolled in
plans with deductibles change utilization patterns after an exogenous reduction
in cost-sharing.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Intelligent organisms can solve truly novel problems which they have never
encountered before, either in their lifetime or their evolution. An important
component of this capacity is the ability to ``think'', that is, to mentally
manipulate objects, concepts and behaviors in order to plan and evaluate
possible solutions to novel problems, even without environment interaction. To
generate problems that are truly qualitatively novel, while still solvable
zero-shot (by mental simulation), we use the combinatorial nature of
environments: we train the agent while withholding a specific combination of
the environment's elements. The novel test task, based on this combination, is
thus guaranteed to be truly novel, while still mentally simulable since the
agent has been exposed to each individual element (and their pairwise
interactions) during training. We propose a method to train agents endowed with
world models to make use their mental simulation abilities, by selecting tasks
based on the difference between the agent's pre-thinking and post-thinking
performance. When tested on the novel, withheld problem, the resulting agent
successfully simulated alternative scenarios and used the resulting information
to guide its behavior in the actual environment, solving the novel task in a
single real-environment trial (zero-shot).</p>

<p class='card-text'>Highly accurate geometric precision and dense image features characterize
True Digital Orthophoto Maps (TDOMs), which are in great demand for
applications such as urban planning, infrastructure management, and
environmental monitoring. Traditional TDOM generation methods need
sophisticated processes, such as Digital Surface Models (DSM) and occlusion
detection, which are computationally expensive and prone to errors. This work
presents an alternative technique rooted in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), free
of explicit DSM and occlusion detection. With depth map generation, spatial
information for every pixel within the TDOM is retrieved and can reconstruct
the scene with high precision. Divide-and-conquer strategy achieves excellent
GS training and rendering with high-resolution TDOMs at a lower resource cost,
which preserves higher quality of rendering on complex terrain and thin
structure without a decrease in efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate
the efficiency of large-scale scene reconstruction and high-precision terrain
modeling. This approach provides accurate spatial data, which assists users in

<p class='card-text'>Reliable quantification of Ki-67, a key proliferation marker in breast
cancer, is essential for molecular subtyping and informed treatment planning.
Conventional approaches, including visual estimation and manual counting,
suffer from interobserver variability and limited reproducibility. This study
introduces an AI-assisted method using the YOLOv8 object detection framework
for automated Ki-67 scoring. High-resolution digital images (40x magnification)
of immunohistochemically stained tumor sections were captured from Ki-67
hotspot regions and manually annotated by a domain expert to distinguish
Ki-67-positive and negative tumor cells. The dataset was augmented and divided
into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) subsets. Among the
YOLOv8 variants tested, the Medium model achieved the highest performance, with
a mean Average Precision at 50% Intersection over Union (mAP50) exceeding 85%
for Ki-67-positive cells. The proposed approach offers an efficient, scalable,
and objective alternative to conventional scoring methods, supporting greater
consistency in Ki-67 evaluation. Future directions include developing
user-friendly clinical interfaces and expanding to multi-institutional datasets
to enhance generalizability and facilitate broader adoption in diagnostic

<p class='card-text'>In perioperative care, precise in-bed 3D patient pose and shape estimation
(PSE) can be vital in optimizing patient positioning in preoperative planning,
enabling accurate overlay of medical images for augmented reality-based
surgical navigation, and mitigating risks of prolonged immobility during
recovery. Conventional PSE methods relying on modalities such as RGB-D,
infrared, or pressure maps often struggle with occlusions caused by bedding and
complex patient positioning, leading to inaccurate estimation that can affect
clinical outcomes. To address these challenges, we present the first
multi-modal in-bed patient 3D PSE network that fuses detailed geometric
features extracted from routinely acquired computed tomography (CT) scans with
depth maps (mPSE-CT). mPSE-CT incorporates a shape estimation module that
utilizes probabilistic correspondence alignment, a pose estimation module with
a refined neural network, and a final parameters mixing module. This
multi-modal network robustly reconstructs occluded body regions and enhances
the accuracy of the estimated 3D human mesh model. We validated mPSE-CT using
proprietary whole-body rigid phantom and volunteer datasets in clinical
scenarios. mPSE-CT outperformed the best-performing prior method by 23% and
49.16% in pose and shape estimation respectively, demonstrating its potential
for improving clinical outcomes in challenging perioperative environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This study evaluates the accuracy of nuclear fragmentation simulations using
a quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) model based on relativistic mean field (RMF)
theory for an energy range of 50-400 MeV/u, relevant to hadron therapy. A total
of 16 parameter sets within the RMF framework are assessed based on their
ability to reproduce ground-state properties such as the mean squared radius
and binding energy, as obtained in QMD simulations. Among these, the NS2
parameter set is identified as the most suitable for describing stable nuclei
over a wide mass range, with the use of an adaptive Gaussian wave packet width.
Fragmentation cross sections of carbon ion projectiles on light nuclei targets
(H, C, O, Al, Ti, and Cu) are simulated at incident energies of 50, 95, 290,
and 400 MeV/u and compared with experimental data. The results indicate that
the RQMD.RMF model provides superior reproductions for fragmentation at lower
energies (50 and 95 MeV/u) compared to the Light Ion QMD (LIQMD) model
implemented in Geant4 version 11.2. At higher energies (290 and 400 MeV/u), the
RQMD.RMF model performs comparably to the LIQMD. This study demonstrates that
the RQMD.RMF model provides a reliable framework for analyzing nuclear
fragmentation and holds potential for applications in the planning and quality
assurance of hadron therapy.</p>
