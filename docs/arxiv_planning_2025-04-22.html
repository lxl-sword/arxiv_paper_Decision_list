<p class='card-text'>Multi-view understanding, the ability to reconcile visual information across
diverse viewpoints for effective navigation, manipulation, and 3D scene
comprehension, is a fundamental challenge in Multi-Modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to be used as embodied agents. While recent MLLMs have shown impressive
advances in high-level reasoning and planning, they frequently fall short when
confronted with multi-view geometric consistency and cross-view correspondence.
To comprehensively evaluate the challenges of MLLMs in multi-view scene
reasoning, we propose All-Angles Bench, a benchmark of over 2,100 human
carefully annotated multi-view question-answer pairs across 90 diverse
real-world scenes. Our six tasks (counting, attribute identification, relative
distance, relative direction, object manipulation, and camera pose estimation)
specifically test model's geometric correspondence and the capacity to align
information consistently across views. Our extensive experiments, benchmark on
27 representative MLLMs including Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and
GPT-4o against human evaluators reveals a substantial performance gap,
indicating that current MLLMs remain far from human-level proficiency. Through
in-depth analysis, we show that MLLMs are particularly underperforming under
two aspects: (1) cross-view correspondence for partially occluded views and (2)
establishing the coarse camera poses. These findings highlight the necessity of
domain-specific refinements or modules that embed stronger multi-view
awareness. We believe that our All-Angles Bench offers valuable insights and
contribute to bridging the gap between MLLMs and human-level multi-view
understanding. The project and benchmark are publicly available at

<p class='card-text'>We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction
of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably
quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like
real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our
tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a)
discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay,
drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in
designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and
conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic and memorizes excessively;
comparatively, multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and
diffusion models, excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, in
our tasks, we find that to elicit randomness from the Transformer without
hurting coherence, it is better to inject noise right at the input layer (via a
method we dub hash-conditioning) rather than defer to temperature sampling from
the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for
analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond
next-token learning and softmax-based sampling. We make part of the code

<p class='card-text'>Modern power systems face growing risks from cyber-physical attacks,
necessitating enhanced resilience due to their societal function as critical
infrastructures. The challenge is that defense of large-scale
systems-of-systems requires scalability in their threat and risk assessment
environment for cyber physical analysis including cyber-informed transmission
planning, decision-making, and intrusion response. Hence, we present a scalable
discrete event simulation tool for analysis of energy systems, called DESTinE.
The tool is tailored for largescale cyber-physical systems, with a focus on
power systems. It supports faster-than-real-time traffic generation and models
packet flow and congestion under both normal and adversarial conditions. Using
three well-established power system synthetic cases with 500, 2000, and 10,000
buses, we overlay a constructed cyber network employing star and radial
topologies. Experiments are conducted to identify critical nodes within a
communication network in response to a disturbance. The findings are
incorporated into a constrained optimization problem to assess the impact of
the disturbance on a specific node and its cascading effects on the overall
network. Based on the solution of the optimization problem, a new hybrid
network topology is also derived, combining the strengths of star and radial
structures to improve network resilience. Furthermore, DESTinE is integrated
with a virtual server and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system using Raspberry
Pi 5.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) is a fundamental problem in robotics,
particularly in applications such as warehouse automation and logistics.
Existing solutions often face challenges in scalability, adaptability, and
efficiency, limiting their applicability in dynamic environments with real-time
planning requirements. This paper presents Neural ATTF (Adaptive Task Token
Framework), a new algorithm that combines a Priority Guided Task Matching
(PGTM) Module with Neural STA* (Space-Time A*), a data-driven path planning
method. Neural STA* enhances path planning by enabling rapid exploration of the
search space through guided learned heuristics and ensures collision avoidance
under dynamic constraints. PGTM prioritizes delayed agents and dynamically
assigns tasks by prioritizing agents nearest to these tasks, optimizing both
continuity and system throughput. Experimental evaluations against
state-of-the-art MAPD algorithms, including TPTS, CENTRAL, RMCA, LNS-PBS, and
LNS-wPBS, demonstrate the superior scalability, solution quality, and

<p class='card-text'>Deploying robot learning methods to a quadrotor in unstructured outdoor
environments is an exciting task. Quadrotors operating in real-world
environments by learning-based methods encounter several challenges: a large
amount of simulator generated data required for training, strict demands for
real-time processing onboard, and the sim-to-real gap caused by dynamic and
noisy conditions. Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying
learning-based methods to end-to-end control of quadrotors, but rarely mention
the infrastructure system training from scratch and deploying to reality, which
makes it difficult to reproduce methods and applications. To bridge this gap,
we propose a platform that enables the seamless transfer of end-to-end deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We integrate the training environment,
flight dynamics control, DRL algorithms, the MAVROS middleware stack, and
hardware into a comprehensive workflow and architecture that enables
quadrotors' policies to be trained from scratch to real-world deployment in
several minutes. Our platform provides rich types of environments including
hovering, dynamic obstacle avoidance, trajectory tracking, balloon hitting, and
planning in unknown environments, as a physical experiment benchmark. Through
extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate the efficiency of proposed
sim-to-real platform, and robust outdoor flight performance under real-world
perturbations. Details can be found from our website

<p class='card-text'>In interactions between automated vehicles (AVs) and crossing pedestrians,
modeling implicit vehicle communication is crucial. In this work, we present a
combined prediction and planning approach that allows to consider the influence
of the planned vehicle behavior on a pedestrian and predict a pedestrian's
reaction. We plan the behavior by solving two consecutive optimal control
problems (OCPs) analytically, using variational calculus. We perform a
validation step that assesses whether the planned vehicle behavior is adequate
to trigger a certain pedestrian reaction, which accounts for the closed-loop
characteristics of prediction and planning influencing each other. In this
step, we model the influence of the planned vehicle behavior on the pedestrian
using a probabilistic behavior acceptance model that returns an estimate for
the crossing probability. The probabilistic modeling of the pedestrian reaction
facilitates considering the pedestrian's costs, thereby improving cooperative
behavior planning. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in
simulated vehicle-pedestrian interactions with varying initial settings and
highlight the decision making capabilities of the planning approach.</p>

<p class='card-text'>A new class of Multi-Rotor Aerial Vehicles (MRAVs), known as omnidirectional
MRAVs (o-MRAVs), has gained attention for their ability to independently
control 3D position and orientation. This capability enhances robust planning
and control in aerial communication networks, enabling more adaptive trajectory
planning and precise antenna alignment without additional mechanical
components. These features are particularly valuable in uncertain environments,
where disturbances such as wind and interference affect communication
stability. This paper examines o-MRAVs in the context of robust aerial network
planning, comparing them with the more common under-actuated MRAVs (u-MRAVs).
Key applications, including physical layer security, optical communications,

<p class='card-text'>We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must
choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce
uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as
separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active
inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, offers such a foundation by
minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility
with epistemic drives like ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However,
the computational burden of EFE minimization has remained a major obstacle to
its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises
naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative
model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces
theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle, by casting planning
itself as variational inference. Our formulation yields optimal policies that
jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a
complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This
unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable,
resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Communication is fundamental for multi-robot collaboration, with accurate
radio mapping playing a crucial role in predicting signal strength between
robots. However, modeling radio signal propagation in large and occluded
environments is challenging due to complex interactions between signals and
obstacles. Existing methods face two key limitations: they struggle to predict
signal strength for transmitter-receiver pairs not present in the training set,
while also requiring extensive manual data collection for modeling, making them
impractical for large, obstacle-rich scenarios. To overcome these limitations,
we propose FERMI, a flexible radio mapping framework. FERMI combines
physics-based modeling of direct signal paths with a neural network to capture
environmental interactions with radio signals. This hybrid model learns radio
signal propagation more efficiently, requiring only sparse training data.
Additionally, FERMI introduces a scalable planning method for autonomous data
collection using a multi-robot team. By increasing parallelism in data
collection and minimizing robot travel costs between regions, overall data
collection efficiency is significantly improved. Experiments in both simulation
and real-world scenarios demonstrate that FERMI enables accurate signal
prediction and generalizes well to unseen positions in complex environments. It
also supports fully autonomous data collection and scales to different team
sizes, offering a flexible solution for creating radio maps. Our code is

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-20 21:41:29</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Hierarchical composite endpoints, such as those analyzed using the
Finkelstein-Schoenfeld (FS) statistic, are increasingly used in clinical trials
for their ability to incorporate clinically prioritized outcomes. However,
adaptive design methods for these endpoints remain underdeveloped. This paper
presents a practical framework for implementing sample size re-estimation (SSR)
in trials using hierarchical composites, motivated by a cardiovascular trial
with mortality, hospitalization, and a functional response as prioritized
endpoints. We use a two-stage adaptive design with a single interim analysis
for illustration. The interim analysis incorporates predictive probabilities to
determine whether the trial should stop for futility, continue as planned, or
increase the sample size to maintain power. The decision framework is based on
predefined zones for predictive probability, with corresponding adjustments to
the stage 2 sample size. Simulation studies across various treatment scenarios
demonstrate strong type I error control and increased power compared to a fixed
design, particularly for treatment effects that are clinically relevant but
lower than the alternative hypothesis. We also explore an alternative
conditional power approach for SSR, offering further sample size optimization.
Our results support the use of SSR with hierarchical composite outcomes using
an FS statistic, enhancing trial efficiency.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous driving has garnered significant attention for its potential to
improve safety, traffic efficiency, and user convenience. However, the dynamic
and complex nature of interactive driving poses significant challenges,
including the need to navigate non-linear road geometries, handle dynamic
obstacles, and meet stringent safety and comfort requirements. Traditional
approaches, such as artificial potential fields (APF), often fall short in
addressing these complexities independently, necessitating the development of
integrated and adaptive frameworks. This paper presents a novel approach to
autonomous vehicle navigation that integrates artificial potential fields,
Frenet coordinates, and improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO). A dynamic
risk field, adapted from traditional APF, is proposed to ensure interactive
safety by quantifying risks and dynamically adjusting lane-changing intentions
based on surrounding vehicle behavior. Frenet coordinates are utilized to
simplify trajectory planning on non-straight roads, while an enhanced quintic
polynomial trajectory generator ensures smooth and comfortable path
transitions. Additionally, an IPSO algorithm optimizes trajectory selection in
real time, balancing safety and user comfort within a feasible input range. The
proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world
scenarios, demonstrating its ability to navigate complex traffic environments,
maintain safety margins, and generate smooth, dynamically feasible

state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including
KVASIR-SEG, PH2, EndoVis, and GLAS, with an average Dice similarity coefficient

<p class='card-text'>Machine learning (ML)-based planners have recently gained significant
attention. They offer advantages over traditional optimization-based planning
algorithms. These advantages include fewer manually selected parameters and
faster development. Within ML-based planning, imitation learning (IL) is a
common algorithm. It primarily learns driving policies directly from supervised
trajectory data. While IL has demonstrated strong performance on many open-loop
benchmarks, it remains challenging to determine if the learned policy truly
understands fundamental driving principles, rather than simply extrapolating
from the ego-vehicle's initial state. Several studies have identified this
limitation and proposed algorithms to address it. However, these methods often
use original datasets for evaluation. In these datasets, future trajectories
are heavily dependent on initial conditions. Furthermore, IL often overfits to
the most common scenarios. It struggles to generalize to rare or unseen
situations.
  To address these challenges, this work proposes: 1) a novel closed-loop
simulator supporting both imitation and reinforcement learning, 2) a causal
benchmark derived from the Waymo Open Dataset to rigorously assess the impact
of the copycat problem, and 3) a novel framework integrating imitation learning
and reinforcement learning to overcome the limitations of purely imitative
approaches. The code for this work will be released soon.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The moving target traveling salesman problem with obstacles (MT-TSP-O) seeks
an obstacle-free trajectory for an agent that intercepts a given set of moving
targets, each within specified time windows, and returns to the agent's
starting position. Each target moves with a constant velocity within its time
windows, and the agent has a speed limit no smaller than any target's speed. We
present FMC*-TSP, the first complete and bounded-suboptimal algorithm for the
MT-TSP-O, and results for an agent whose configuration space is $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Our algorithm interleaves a high-level search and a low-level search, where the
high-level search solves a generalized traveling salesman problem with time
windows (GTSP-TW) to find a sequence of targets and corresponding time windows
for the agent to visit. Given such a sequence, the low-level search then finds
an associated agent trajectory. To solve the low-level planning problem, we
develop a new algorithm called FMC*, which finds a shortest path on a graph of

study investigates the integration of Generative Design, Virtual Reality (VR),

<p class='card-text'>Satellite-based communication systems are integral to delivering high-speed
data services in aviation, particularly for business aviation operations
requiring global connectivity. These systems, however, are challenged by a
multitude of interdependent factors such as satellite handovers, congestion,
flight maneuvers and seasonal trends, making network performance prediction a
complex task. No established methodologies currently exist for network
performance prediction in avionic communication systems. This paper addresses
the gap by proposing machine learning (ML)-based approaches for pre-flight
network performance predictions. The proposed models predict performance along
a given flight path, taking as input positional and network-related information
and outputting the predicted performance for each position. In business
aviation, flight crews typically have multiple flight plans to choose from for
each city pair, allowing them to select the most optimal option. This approach
enables proactive decision-making, such as selecting optimal flight paths prior
to departure.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In automated web testing, generating test scripts from natural language task
descriptions is crucial for enhancing the test generation process. This
activity involves creating the correct sequences of actions to form test
scripts for future testing activities. Current state-of-the-art approaches are
limited in generating these action sequences, as they either demand substantial
manual effort for human demonstrations or fail to consider the history of
previous web content and actions to decide the next action. In this paper, we
introduce HxAgent, an iterative large language model agent planning approach
that determines the next action based on: 1) observations of the current
contents and feasible actions, 2) short-term memory of previous web states and
actions, and 3) long-term experience with (in)correct action sequences. The
agent generates a sequence of actions to perform a given task, which is
effectively an automated test case to verify the task. We conducted an
extensive empirical evaluation of HxAgent using two datasets. On the MiniWoB++
dataset, our approach achieves 97% exact-match accuracy that is comparable to
the best baselines while eliminating the need for human demonstrations required
by those methods. For complex tasks requiring navigation through multiple
actions and screens, HxAgent achieves an average 82% exact-match. On the second
dataset, comprising 350 task instances across seven popular websites, including
YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google, HxAgent achieves high performance,
with 87% of the action sequences exactly matching the ground truth and a
prefix-match of 93%, outperforming the baseline by 59%.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The scarcity of high-quality residential load data can pose obstacles for
decarbonizing the residential sector as well as effective grid planning and
operation. The above challenges have motivated research into generating
synthetic load data, but existing methods faced limitations in terms of
scalability, diversity, and similarity. This paper proposes a Generative
Adversarial Network-based Synthetic Residential Load Pattern (RLP-GAN)
generation model, a novel weakly-supervised GAN framework, leveraging an
over-complete autoencoder to capture dependencies within complex and diverse
load patterns and learn household-level data distribution at scale. We
incorporate a model weight selection method to address the mode collapse
problem and generate load patterns with high diversity. We develop a holistic
evaluation method to validate the effectiveness of RLP-GAN using real-world
data of 417 households. The results demonstrate that RLP-GAN outperforms
state-of-the-art models in capturing temporal dependencies and generating load
patterns with higher similarity to real data. Furthermore, we have publicly
released the RLP-GAN generated synthetic dataset, which comprises one million

<p class='card-text'>Data-driven emulation of nonlinear dynamics is challenging due to long-range
skill decay that often produces physically unrealistic outputs. Recent advances
in generative modeling aim to address these issues by providing uncertainty
quantification and correction. However, the quality of generated simulation
remains heavily dependent on the choice of conditioning priors. In this work,
we present an efficient generative framework for dynamics emulation, unifying
principles of turbulence with diffusion-based modeling: Cohesion. Specifically,
our method estimates large-scale coherent structure of the underlying dynamics
as guidance during the denoising process, where small-scale fluctuation in the
flow is then resolved. These coherent priors are efficiently approximated using
reduced-order models, such as deep Koopman operators, that allow for rapid
generation of long prior sequences while maintaining stability over extended
forecasting horizon. With this gain, we can reframe forecasting as trajectory
planning, a common task in reinforcement learning, where conditional denoising
is performed once over entire sequences, minimizing the computational cost of
autoregressive-based generative methods. Empirical evaluations on chaotic
systems of increasing complexity, including Kolmogorov flow, shallow water
equations, and subseasonal-to-seasonal climate dynamics, demonstrate Cohesion
superior long-range forecasting skill that can efficiently generate
physically-consistent simulations, even in the presence of partially-observed
guidance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The requirement for autonomous robots to exhibit higher-level cognitive
skills by planning and adapting in an ever-changing environment is indeed a
great challenge for the AI community. Progress has been made in the automated
planning community on refinement and repair of an agent's symbolic knowledge to
do task planning in an incomplete or changing environmental model, but these
advances up to now have not been transferred to real physical robots. This
paper demonstrates how a physical robot can be capable of adapting its symbolic
knowledge of the environment, by using experiences in robot action execution to
drive knowledge refinement and hence to improve the success rate of the task
plans the robot creates. To implement more robust planning systems, we propose
a method for refining domain knowledge to improve the knowledge on which
intelligent robot behavior is based. This architecture has been implemented and
evaluated using a NAO robot. The refined knowledge leads to the future
synthesis of task plans which demonstrate decreasing rates of failure over time
as faulty knowledge is removed or adjusted.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Traffic flow prediction plays an important role in Intelligent Transportation
Systems in traffic management and urban planning. There have been extensive
successful works in this area. However, these approaches focus only on
modelling the flow transition and ignore the flow generation process, which
manifests itself in two ways: (i) The models are based on Markovian
assumptions, ignoring the multi-periodicity of the flow generation in nodes.
(ii) The same structure is designed to encode both the transition and
generation processes, ignoring the differences between them. To address these
problems, we propose an Effective Multi-Branch Similarity Transformer for
Traffic Flow Prediction, namely EMBSFormer. Through data analysis, we find that
the factors affecting traffic flow include node-level traffic generation and
graph-level traffic transition, which describe the multi-periodicity and
interaction pattern of nodes, respectively. Specifically, to capture traffic
generation patterns, we propose a similarity analysis module that supports
multi-branch encoding to dynamically expand significant cycles. For traffic
transition, we employ a temporal and spatial self-attention mechanism to
maintain global node interactions, and use GNN and time conv to model local
node interactions, respectively. Model performance is evaluated on three
real-world datasets on both long-term and short-term prediction tasks.
Experimental results show that EMBSFormer outperforms baselines on both tasks.
Moreover, compared to models based on flow transition modelling (e.g. GMAN,
513k), the variant of EMBSFormer(93K) only uses 18\% of the parameters,
achieving the same performance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have powered Graphical User
Interface (GUI) Agents, showing promise in automating tasks on computing
devices. Recent works have begun exploring reasoning in GUI tasks with
encouraging results. However, many current approaches rely on manually designed
reasoning templates, which may result in reasoning that is not sufficiently
robust and adaptive for complex GUI environments. Meanwhile, some existing
agents continue to operate as Reactive Actors, relying primarily on implicit
reasoning that may lack sufficient depth for GUI tasks demanding planning and
error recovery. We argue that advancing these agents requires a shift from
reactive acting towards acting based on deliberate reasoning. To facilitate
this transformation, we introduce InfiGUI-R1, an MLLM-based GUI agent developed
through our Actor2Reasoner framework, a reasoning-centric, two-stage training
approach designed to progressively evolve agents from Reactive Actors to
Deliberative Reasoners. The first stage, Reasoning Injection, focuses on
establishing a basic reasoner. We employ Spatial Reasoning Distillation to
transfer cross-modal spatial reasoning capabilities from teacher models to
MLLMs through trajectories with explicit reasoning steps, enabling models to
integrate GUI visual-spatial information with logical reasoning before action
generation. The second stage, Deliberation Enhancement, refines the basic
reasoner into a deliberative one using Reinforcement Learning. This stage
introduces two approaches: Sub-goal Guidance, which rewards models for
generating accurate intermediate sub-goals, and Error Recovery Scenario
Construction, which creates failure-and-recovery training scenarios from
identified prone-to-error steps. Experimental results show InfiGUI-R1 achieves
strong performance in GUI grounding and trajectory tasks. Resources at

  intensity-modulated proton therapy</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Ivar Bengtsson</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-19 08:25:36</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Robust optimization is a commonly employed method to mitigate uncertainties
in the planning of intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). In certain
contexts, the large number of uncertainty scenarios makes the robust problem
impractically expensive to solve. Recent developments in research on IMPT
treatment planning indicate that the number of ideally considered error
scenarios may continue to increase.
  In this paper, we therefore investigate methods that reduce the size of the
scenario set considered during the robust optimization. Six cases of patients
with non-small cell lung cancer are considered. First, we investigate the
existence of an optimal subset of scenarios that needs to be considered during
robust optimization, and perform experiments to see if the set can be found in
a reasonable time and substitute for the full set of scenarios during robust
IMPT optimization. We then consider heuristic methods to estimate this subset
or find subsets with similar properties. Specifically, we select a subset of
maximal diversity in terms of scenario-specific features such as the dose
distributions and function gradients at the initial point. Finally, we consider
adversarial methods as an alternative to solving the full robust problem and
investigate the impact on computation times.
  The results indicate that the optimal subset can be well approximated by
solving the robust IMPT problem with conventional methods. Of the methods
designed to approximate it within a practically useful time frame, the results
of the diversity-maximization methods indicate that they may perform better
than a manual selection of scenarios based on the patient geometry. In
addition, the adversarial approaches decreased the computation time by at least
half compared to the conventional approach.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Image-based crack detection algorithms are increasingly in demand in
infrastructure monitoring, as early detection of cracks is of paramount
importance for timely maintenance planning. While deep learning has
significantly advanced crack detection algorithms, existing models often
require extensive labeled datasets and high computational costs for
fine-tuning, limiting their adaptability across diverse conditions. This study
introduces an efficient selective fine-tuning strategy, focusing on tuning
normalization components, to enhance the adaptability of segmentation models
for crack detection. The proposed method is applied to the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and five well-established segmentation models. Experimental results
demonstrate that selective fine-tuning of only normalization parameters
outperforms full fine-tuning and other common fine-tuning techniques in both
performance and computational efficiency, while improving generalization. The
proposed approach yields a SAM-based model, Segment Any Crack (SAC), achieving
a 61.22\% F1-score and 44.13\% IoU on the OmniCrack30k benchmark dataset, along
with the highest performance across three zero-shot datasets and the lowest
standard deviation. The results highlight the effectiveness of the adaptation
approach in improving segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing

<p class='card-text'>Knitting, a cornerstone of textile manufacturing, is uniquely challenging to
automate, particularly in terms of converting fabric designs into precise,
machine-readable instructions. This research bridges the gap between textile
production and robotic automation by proposing a novel deep learning-based
pipeline for reverse knitting to integrate vision-based robotic systems into
textile manufacturing. The pipeline employs a two-stage architecture, enabling
robots to first identify front labels before inferring complete labels,
ensuring accurate, scalable pattern generation. By incorporating diverse yarn

demonstrates how our system can adapt to varying material complexities.
Critical challenges in robotic textile manipulation, such as label imbalance,
underrepresented stitch types, and the need for fine-grained control, are

<p class='card-text'>In automated driving, predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles
supports reasoning about scene dynamics and enables safe planning for the ego
vehicle. However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task
of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time
proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which
means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat
them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a
novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the
model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on
previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of
subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors
during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse
demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up
to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We
further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better
handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Change detection (CD) in remote sensing imagery plays a crucial role in
various applications such as urban planning, damage assessment, and resource

performance, current methods suffer from poor domain adaptability, requiring
extensive labeled data for retraining when applied to new scenarios. This

Additionally, we propose a novel Micro-Labeled Fine-Tuning approach that
strategically selects and labels a minimal amount of samples (less than 1%) to

previous research. Experiments conducted on the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets
demonstrate that DAM-Net significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in dialogue policy planning have emphasized optimizing
system agent policies to achieve predefined goals, focusing on strategy design,
trajectory acquisition, and efficient training paradigms. However, these
approaches often overlook the critical role of user characteristics, which are
essential in real-world scenarios like conversational search and
recommendation, where interactions must adapt to individual user traits such as
personality, preferences, and goals. To address this gap, we first conduct a
comprehensive study utilizing task-specific user personas to systematically
assess dialogue policy planning under diverse user behaviors. By leveraging
realistic user profiles for different tasks, our study reveals significant
limitations in existing approaches, highlighting the need for user-tailored
dialogue policy planning. Building on this foundation, we present the
User-Tailored Dialogue Policy Planning (UDP) framework, which incorporates an
Intrinsic User World Model to model user traits and feedback. UDP operates in
three stages: (1) User Persona Portraying, using a diffusion model to
dynamically infer user profiles; (2) User Feedback Anticipating, leveraging a
Brownian Bridge-inspired anticipator to predict user reactions; and (3)
User-Tailored Policy Planning, integrating these insights to optimize response
strategies. To ensure robust performance, we further propose an active learning
approach that prioritizes challenging user personas during training.
Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks, including collaborative and
non-collaborative settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of UDP in learning
user-specific dialogue strategies. Results validate the protocol's utility and
