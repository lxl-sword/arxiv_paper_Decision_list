<p class='card-text'>Achieving robust cognitive autonomy in robots navigating complex,
unpredictable environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. This
paper presents Underwater Robot Self-Organizing Autonomy (UROSA), a
groundbreaking architecture leveraging distributed Large Language Model AI
agents integrated within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework to
enable advanced cognitive capabilities in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. UROSA
decentralises cognition into specialised AI agents responsible for multimodal
perception, adaptive reasoning, dynamic mission planning, and real-time
decision-making. Central innovations include flexible agents dynamically
adapting their roles, retrieval-augmented generation utilising vector databases
for efficient knowledge management, reinforcement learning-driven behavioural
optimisation, and autonomous on-the-fly ROS 2 node generation for runtime
functional extensibility. Extensive empirical validation demonstrates UROSA's
promising adaptability and reliability through realistic underwater missions in
simulation and real-world deployments, showing significant advantages over
traditional rule-based architectures in handling unforeseen scenarios,
environmental uncertainties, and novel mission objectives. This work not only
advances underwater autonomy but also establishes a scalable, safe, and
versatile cognitive robotics framework capable of generalising to a diverse
array of real-world applications.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-31 14:42:12</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Estimating electricity consumption accurately is essential for the planning
and operation of energy systems, as well as for billing processes. Standard
Load Profiles (SLP) are widely used to estimate consumption patterns of
different user groups. However, in Germany these SLP were formulated using
historical data from over 20 years ago and have not been adjusted since.
Changing electricity consumption behaviour, which leads to increasing
deviations between load patterns and SLP, results in a need for a revision
taking into account new data. The growing number of smart meters provides a
large measurement database, which enables more accurate load modelling. This
paper creates updated SLP using recent data. In addition, the assumptions of
the SLP method are validated and improvements are proposed, taking into account
the ease of applicability. Furthermore, a Fourier Series-based model is
proposed as an alternative SLP model. The different models are compared and
evaluated.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Distribution grid operation faces new challenges caused by a rising share of
renewable energy sources and the introduction of additional types of loads to
the grid. With the increasing adoption of distributed generation and emerging
prosumer households, Energy Management Systems, which manage and apply
flexibility of connected devices, are gaining popularity. While potentially
beneficial to grid capacity, strategic energy management also adds to the
complexity of distribution grid operation and planning processes. Novel
approaches of time-series-based planning likewise face increasingly complex
simulation scenarios and rising computational cost. Discrete event modelling
helps facilitating simulations of such scenarios by restraining computation to
the most relevant points in simulation time. We provide an enhancement of a
discrete event distribution grid simulation software that offers fast
implementation and testing of energy management algorithms, embedded into a
feature-rich simulation environment. Physical models are specified using the
Discrete Event System Specification. Furthermore, we contribute a communication
protocol that makes use of the discrete event paradigm by only computing
flexibility potential when necessary.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-31 08:56:24</h6>
<p class='card-text'>There is a growing demand for autonomous mobile robots capable of navigating
unstructured agricultural environments. Tasks such as weed control in meadows
require efficient path planning through an unordered set of coordinates while
minimizing travel distance and adhering to curvature constraints to prevent
soil damage and protect vegetation. This paper presents an integrated
navigation framework combining a global path planner based on the Dubins
Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
(NMPC) strategy for local path planning and control. The DTSP generates a
minimum-length, curvature-constrained path that efficiently visits all targets,
while the NMPC leverages this path to compute control signals to accurately
reach each waypoint. The system's performance was validated through comparative
simulation analysis on real-world field datasets, demonstrating that the
coupled DTSP-based planner produced smoother and shorter paths, with a
reduction of about 16% in the provided scenario, compared to decoupled methods.
Based thereon, the NMPC controller effectively steered the robot to the desired
waypoints, while locally optimizing the trajectory and ensuring adherence to
constraints. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework
for efficient autonomous navigation in agricultural environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%

<p class='card-text'>A key challenge in deploying automated vehicles (AVs) is ensuring they make
appropriate decisions in ethically challenging everyday driving situations.
While much attention has been paid to rare, high-stakes dilemmas such as
trolley problems, similar tensions also arise in routine scenarios, such as
navigating empty intersections, where multiple human considerations, including
legality and comfort, often conflict. Current AV planning systems typically
rely on rigid rules, which struggle to balance these competing considerations
and can lead to behaviour that misaligns with human expectations. This paper
proposes a novel reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that
operationalises the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). The
framework models the reasons of human agents, such as regulatory compliance, as
quantifiable functions and evaluates how well candidate AV trajectories align
with these reasons. By assigning adjustable weights to agent priorities and
integrating a balance function to discourage the exclusion of any agent, the
framework supports interpretable decision evaluation. Through a
real-world-inspired overtaking scenario, we show how this approach reveals
tensions, for instance between regulatory compliance, efficiency, and comfort.
The framework functions as a modular evaluation layer over existing planning
algorithms. It offers a transparent tool for assessing ethical alignment in
everyday scenarios and provides a practical step toward implementing MHC in
real-world AV deployment.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across

<p class='card-text'>Ethical dilemmas are a common challenge in everyday driving, requiring human
drivers to balance competing priorities such as safety, efficiency, and rule
compliance. However, much of the existing research in automated vehicles (AVs)
has focused on high-stakes "trolley problems," which involve extreme and rare
situations. Such scenarios, though rich in ethical implications, are rarely
applicable in real-world AV decision-making. In practice, when AVs confront
everyday ethical dilemmas, they often appear to prioritise strict adherence to
traffic rules. By contrast, human drivers may bend the rules in
context-specific situations, using judgement informed by practical concerns
such as safety and efficiency. According to the concept of meaningful human
control, AVs should respond to human reasons, including those of drivers,
vulnerable road users, and policymakers. This work introduces a novel human
reasons-based supervision framework that detects when AV behaviour misaligns
with expected human reasons to trigger trajectory reconsideration. The
framework integrates with motion planning and control systems to support
real-time adaptation, enabling decisions that better reflect safety,
efficiency, and regulatory considerations. Simulation results demonstrate that
this approach could help AVs respond more effectively to ethical challenges in
dynamic driving environments by prompting replanning when the current
trajectory fails to align with human reasons. These findings suggest that our
approach offers a path toward more adaptable, human-centered decision-making in
AVs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In recent times, products have become increasingly complex and highly
reliable, so failures typically occur after long periods of operation under
normal conditions and may arise from multiple causes. This paper employs simple
step-stress partial accelerated life testing (SSSPALT) within the competing
risks framework to determine the Bayesian reliability acceptance sampling plan
(BRASP) under type-II censoring. Elevating the stress during the life test
incurs an additional cost that increases the cost of the life test. In this
context, an adaptive scenario is also considered in that sampling plan. The
adaptive scenario is as follows: the stress is increased after a certain time
if the number of failures up to that point is less than a pre-specified number
of failures. The Bayes decision function and Bayes risk are derived for the
general loss function. An optimal BRASP under that adaptive SSSPALT is obtained
for the quadratic loss function by minimizing Bayes risk. An algorithm is
provided to determine the optimal proposed BRASP. Further, comparative studies
are conducted between the proposed BRASP, the conventional non-accelerated
BRASP, and the conventional accelerated BRASP under type-II censoring to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, the methodology
is illustrated using real data.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reconfigurable multi-robot cells offer a promising approach to meet
fluctuating assembly demands. However, the recurrent planning of their
configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in generating optimized,
coordinated multi-robot motion sequences that minimize the assembly duration.
This work presents a simulation-based method for generating such optimized
sequences. The approach separates assembly steps into task-related core
operations and connecting traverse operations. While core operations are
constrained and predetermined, traverse operations offer substantial
optimization potential. Scheduling the core operations is formulated as an
optimization problem, requiring feasible traverse operations to be integrated
using a decomposition-based motion planning strategy. Several solution
techniques are explored, including a sampling heuristic, tree-based search and
gradient-free optimization. For motion planning, a decomposition method is
proposed that identifies specific areas in the schedule, which can be solved
independently with modified centralized path planning algorithms. The proposed
method generates efficient and collision-free multi-robot assembly procedures
that outperform a baseline relying on decentralized, robot-individual motion
planning. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation experiments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
often exhibit radio emission, yet its physical origin remains uncertain,
especially in non-jetted cases. In this Letter, we formulate a general
dynamical framework for a radio-emitting shell driven by disk winds and
expanding through a power-law ambient medium under the influence of SMBH
gravity. We derive and classify power-law-in-time solutions to the governing
equations in the adiabatic regime. In particular, a universal $t^{2/3}$ scaling
emerges naturally when gravitational energy dominates or is comparable to
thermal energy, irrespective of the ambient density profile, whereas the
classical Sedov-Taylor solution is recovered when gravity is negligible. Our
analysis reveals that, in regimes where SMBH gravity governs the shell
expansion, the SMBH mass can be inferred from radio observations of the shell.
This approach is independent of and complementary to conventional mass
estimators, with direct implications for interpreting radio-emitting TDEs and
probing SMBH demographics. Our formalism further predicts that 10-100 GHz
monitoring with existing and planned facilities can yield SMBH masses within
months of disruption, providing a time-domain analogue to reverberation

<p class='card-text'>Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflow is fundamental for populating and
maintaining data warehouses and other data stores accessed by analysts for
downstream tasks. A major shortcoming of modern ETL solutions is the extensive
need for a human-in-the-loop, required to design and implement
context-specific, and often non-generalisable transformations. While related
work in the field of ETL automation shows promising progress, there is a lack
of solutions capable of automatically designing and applying these
transformations. We present FlowETL, a novel example-based autonomous ETL
pipeline architecture designed to automatically standardise and prepare input
datasets according to a concise, user-defined target dataset. FlowETL is an
ecosystem of components which interact together to achieve the desired outcome.
A Planning Engine uses a paired input-output datasets sample to construct a
transformation plan, which is then applied by an ETL worker to the source
dataset. Monitoring and logging provide observability throughout the entire
pipeline. The results show promising generalisation capabilities across 14
datasets of various domains, file structures, and file sizes.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-30 19:41:54</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients,
but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study
investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics
relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted
energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the
relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory
performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models.
Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but
more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas
patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts.
Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately
predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1
score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain
tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are
predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path
for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate
cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-30 18:05:43</h6>
<p class='card-text'>As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-30 17:00:48</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The development of autonomous agents for complex, long-horizon tasks is a
central goal in AI. However, dominant training paradigms face a critical
limitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final
task success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem
we term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail
to generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason
coherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that
integrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding
verifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag
its cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and
provides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to
effective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the
final outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method.
On the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new
state-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on
the most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem
from improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant
actions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and
interpretable agents.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-30 16:42:19</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Query-focused table summarization requires complex reasoning, often
approached through step-by-step natural language (NL) plans. However, NL plans
are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into
executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for
multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured
representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by
formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that
formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to
generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps
into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel
execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our
method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability.
Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms
prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the
advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Land-air bimodal robots (LABR) are gaining attention for autonomous
navigation, combining high mobility from aerial vehicles with long endurance
from ground vehicles. However, existing LABR navigation methods are limited by
suboptimal trajectories from mapping-based approaches and the excessive

two-stage lightweight framework that integrates global key points prediction
with local trajectory refinement to generate efficient and reachable
trajectories. In the first stage, the Global Key points Prediction Network
(GKPN) was used to generate a hybrid land-air keypoint path. The GKPN includes
a Sobel Perception Network (SPN) for improved obstacle detection and a
Lightweight Attention Planning Network (LAPN) to improves predictive ability by
capturing contextual information. In the second stage, the global path is
segmented based on predicted key points and refined using a mapping-based
planner to create smooth, collision-free trajectories. Experiments conducted on
our LABR platform show that our framework reduces network parameters by 14\%

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-30 06:12:03</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Assigning passenger trips to specific network paths using automatic fare
collection (AFC) data is a fundamental application in urban transit analysis.
The task is a difficult inverse problem: the only available information
consists of each passenger's total travel time and their origin and
destination, while individual passenger path choices and dynamic network costs
are unobservable, and behavior varies significantly across space and time. We
propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical model to resolve this problem by jointly
estimating dynamic network costs and passenger path choices while quantifying
their uncertainty. Our model decomposes trip travel time into four components
-- access, in-vehicle, transfer, and egress -- each modeled as a time-varying
random walk. To capture heterogeneous passenger behavior, we introduce a
multinomial logit model with spatiotemporally varying coefficients. We manage
the high dimensionality of these coefficients using kernelized tensor
factorization with Gaussian process priors to effectively model complex
spatiotemporal correlations. We develop a tailored and efficient Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for model inference. A simulation study
demonstrates the method's effectiveness in recovering the underlying model
parameters. On a large-scale dataset from the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway,
our framework demonstrates superior estimation accuracy over established
benchmarks. The results reveal significant spatiotemporal variations in
passenger preferences and provide robust uncertainty quantification, offering
transit operators a powerful tool for enhancing service planning and
operational management.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The advent of end-to-end autonomy stacks - often lacking interpretable
intermediate modules - has placed an increased burden on ensuring that the
final output, i.e., the motion plan, is safe in order to validate the safety of
the entire stack. This requires a safety monitor that is both complete (able to
detect all unsafe plans) and sound (does not flag safe plans). In this work, we
propose a principled safety monitor that leverages modern multi-modal
trajectory predictors to approximate forward reachable sets (FRS) of
surrounding agents. By formulating a convex program, we efficiently extract
these data-driven FRSs directly from the predicted state distributions,
conditioned on scene context such as lane topology and agent history. To ensure
completeness, we leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the FRS and
guarantee coverage of ground-truth trajectories with high probability. To
preserve soundness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or under predictor
failure, we introduce a Bayesian filter that dynamically adjusts the FRS
conservativeness based on the predictor's observed performance. We then assess
the safety of the ego vehicle's motion plan by checking for intersections with
these calibrated FRSs, ensuring the plan remains collision-free under plausible
future behaviors of others. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show
our approach significantly improves soundness while maintaining completeness,
offering a practical and reliable safety monitor for learned autonomy stacks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly capable of
autonomously completing complex, multi-step tasks using external tools. Yet,
they still fall short of human-level performance in most domains including
computer use, software development, and research. Their growing autonomy and
ability to interact with the outside world, also introduces safety and security
risks including potentially misaligned actions and adversarial manipulation. We
argue that human-in-the-loop agentic systems offer a promising path forward,
combining human oversight and control with AI efficiency to unlock productivity
from imperfect systems. We introduce Magentic-UI, an open-source web interface
for developing and studying human-agent interaction. Built on a flexible
multi-agent architecture, Magentic-UI supports web browsing, code execution,

Protocol (MCP). Moreover, Magentic-UI presents six interaction mechanisms for
enabling effective, low-cost human involvement: co-planning, co-tasking,
multi-tasking, action guards, and long-term memory. We evaluate Magentic-UI
across four dimensions: autonomous task completion on agentic benchmarks,
simulated user testing of its interaction capabilities, qualitative studies
with real users, and targeted safety assessments. Our findings highlight

<p class='card-text'>Existing earthmoving autonomy is largely confined to highly controlled and
well-characterized environments due to the complexity of vehicle-terrain
interaction dynamics and the partial observability of the terrain resulting
from unknown and spatially varying soil conditions. In this chapter, a a
soil-property mapping system is proposed to extend the environmental state, in
order to overcome these restrictions and facilitate development of more robust
autonomous earthmoving. A GPU accelerated elevation mapping system is extended
to incorporate a blind mapping component which traces the movement of the blade
through the terrain to displace and erode intersected soil, enabling separately
tracking undisturbed and disturbed soil. Each interaction is approximated as a
flat blade moving through a locally homogeneous soil, enabling modeling of
cutting forces using the fundamental equation of earthmoving (FEE). Building
upon our prior work on in situ soil-property estimation, a method is devised to
extract approximate geometric parameters of the model given the uneven terrain,
and an improved physics infused neural network (PINN) model is developed to
predict soil properties and uncertainties of these estimates. A simulation of a
compact track loader (CTL) with a blade attachment is used to collect data to
train the PINN model. Post-training, the model is leveraged online by the
mapping system to track soil property estimates spatially as separate layers in
the map, with updates being performed in a Bayesian manner. Initial experiments
show that the system accurately highlights regions requiring higher relative
interaction forces, indicating the promise of this approach in enabling
soil-aware planning for autonomous terrain shaping.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Understanding reflectance-related quantities for worlds enables effective
comparative planetology and strengthens mission planning and execution.
Measurements of these properties for Earth, especially its geometric albedo and
phase function, have been difficult to achieve due to our Terrestrial situation
-- it is challenging to obtain planetary-scale brightness measurements for the
world we stand on. Using a curated dataset of visual phase-dependent,
disk-averaged observations of Earth taken from the ground and spacecraft,
alongside a physical-statistical model, this work arrives at a definitive value
for the visual geometric albedo of our planet: 0.242 (+0.005/-0.004). This
albedo constraint is up 30--40% smaller than earlier, widely-quoted values. The
physical-statistical model enables retrieval-like inferences to be performed on
phase curves, and includes contributions from optically thick clouds, optically
thin aerosols, Rayleigh scattering, ocean glint, gas absorption, and Lambertian
surface reflectance. Detailed application of this inverse model to Earth's
phase curve quantifies contributions of these different processes to the
phase-dependent brightness of the Pale Blue Dot. Model selection identifies a
scenario where aerosol forward scattering results in a false negative for
surface habitability detection. Observations of phase curves for Earth at
redder-optical or near-infrared wavelengths could disentangle ocean glint
effects from aerosol forward scattering and would help with understanding the
utility of phase curve observations for the under-development Habitable Worlds

<p class='card-text'>This study addresses the challenge of efficiently assigning locomotives in
large freight rail networks, where operational complexity and power imbalances
make cost-effective planning difficult. It presents a strategic optimization
framework for the Locomotive Assignment Problem (LAP), developed in
collaboration with a major North American Class I Freight Railroad. The problem
is formulated as a network-based integer program over a cyclic space-time
network, producing a repeatable weekly locomotive assignment plan. The model
captures a comprehensive set of real-world operational constraints and jointly
optimizes the placement of pick-up and set-out locomotive work events,
improving the effectiveness of downstream planning. To solve large-scale
instances exactly for the first time, novel reduction rules are introduced to
dramatically reduce the number of light travel arcs in the space-time network.
Extensive computational experiments demonstrate the performance and trade-offs
on real instances under a variety of practical constraints. Beyond delivering
scalable, high-quality solutions, the proposed framework serves as a practical
