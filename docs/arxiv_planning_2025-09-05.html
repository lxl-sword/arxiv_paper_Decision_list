<p class='card-text'>Ytterbium-171 is a versatile atomic species often used in quantum optics,
precision metrology, and quantum computing. Consolidated atomic data is
essential for the planning, execution, and evaluation of experiments. In this
reference, we present physical and optical properties of neutral $^{171}$Yb
relevant to these applications. We emphasize experimental results and
supplement these with theoretical estimates. We present equations to convert
values and derive important parameters. Tabulated results include key
parameters for commonly used transitions in $^{171}$Yb
(${}^1\mathrm{S}_0\rightarrow{}^1\mathrm{P}_1$,
${}^1\mathrm{S}_0\rightarrow{}^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2}\,$,
${}^3\mathrm{P}_{0,2}\rightarrow{}^3\mathrm{S}_1$, and

  Certificates</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Babak Esmaeili, Hamidreza Modares</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-04 17:34:59</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for
homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled
workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently
learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex
semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and
corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based
waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and
define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of
such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids
overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All
agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a
space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing
simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree
is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without
re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not
only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both
environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized,
safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints,
using only data and convex optimization tools.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking
predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking
availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address
key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting
multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a
novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means
clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and
integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes
(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted
parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates
masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal
representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention
mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via
patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions
through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from
Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep
learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and
iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean
squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive
ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different
data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance
gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)
contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that
excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to
substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling
spatial dependencies.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-04 15:48:13</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Serverless computing significantly alters software development by abstracting
infrastructure management and enabling rapid, modular, event-driven
deployments. Despite its benefits, the distinct characteristics of serverless
functions, such as ephemeral execution and fine-grained scalability, pose
unique security challenges, particularly in open-source platforms like
OpenFaaS. Existing approaches typically address isolated phases of the
DevSecOps lifecycle, lacking an integrated and comprehensive security strategy.
To bridge this gap, we propose FaaSGuard, a unified DevSecOps pipeline
explicitly designed for open-source serverless environments. FaaSGuard
systematically embeds lightweight, fail-closed security checks into every stage
of the development lifecycle-planning, coding, building, deployment, and
monitoring-effectively addressing threats such as injection attacks, hard-coded
secrets, and resource exhaustion. We validate our approach empirically through
a case study involving 20 real-world serverless functions from public GitHub
repositories. Results indicate that FaaSGuard effectively detects and prevents
critical vulnerabilities, demonstrating high precision (95%) and recall (91%)
without significant disruption to established CI/CD practices.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-04 11:33:53</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Continuum robots, inspired by octopus arms and elephant trunks, combine
dexterity with intrinsic compliance, making them well suited for unstructured
and confined environments. Yet their continuously deformable morphology poses
challenges for motion planning and control, calling for accurate but
lightweight models. We propose the Lightweight Actuation Space Energy Modeling
(LASEM) framework for cable driven continuum robots, which formulates actuation
potential energy directly in actuation space. LASEM yields an analytical
forward model derived from geometrically nonlinear beam and rod theories via
Hamilton's principle, while avoiding explicit modeling of cable backbone
contact. It accepts both force and displacement inputs, thereby unifying
kinematic and static formulations. Assuming the friction is neglected, the
framework generalizes to nonuniform geometries, arbitrary cable routings,
distributed loading and axial extensibility, while remaining computationally
efficient for real-time use. Numerical simulations validate its accuracy, and a
semi-analytical iterative scheme is developed for inverse kinematics. To
address discretization in practical robots, LASEM further reformulates the
functional minimization as a numerical optimization, which also naturally
incorporates cable potential energy without explicit contact modeling.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-04 10:52:27</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Object reconstruction and inspection tasks play a crucial role in various
robotics applications. Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of
the object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects
efficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem.
Current methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating
potential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However,
these methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several
candidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally
efficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most
informative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the
camera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the
whole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint
without the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and
realistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying
sizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning
strategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world
experiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed
method's performance in practice. Our results suggest that there is no
significant difference in object coverage and entropy. In contrast, our method
is approximately nine times faster than the baseline sampling-based method in
terms of the average time the robot spends between views.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general

leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a

While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-04 08:47:26</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However,
traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks
due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial
mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these
challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with
a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates
action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective
strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A
similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past
predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and
LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly
increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful
real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong
generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-04 08:41:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The PQDSS standardization process requires cryptographic primitives to be
free from vulnerabilities, including timing and cache side-channels. Resistance
to timing leakage is therefore an essential property, and achieving this
typically relies on software implementations that follow constant-time
principles. Moreover, ensuring that all implementations are constant-time is
crucial for fair performance comparisons, as secure implementations often incur
additional overhead. Such analysis also helps identify scheme proposals that
are inherently difficult to implement in constant time. Because constant-time
properties can be broken during compilation, it is often necessary to analyze
the compiled binary directly. Since manual binary analysis is extremely
challenging, automated analysis becomes highly important. Although several
tools exist to assist with such analysis, they often have usability limitations
and are difficult to set up correctly. To support the developers besides the
NIST committee in verifying candidates, we developed a toolchain that automates
configuration, execution, and result analysis for several widely used
constant-time analysis tools. We selected TIMECOP and Binsec/Rel2 to verify
constant-time policy compliance at the binary level, and dudect and RTLF to
detect side-channel vulnerabilities through statistical analysis of execution
time behavior. We demonstrate its effectiveness and practicability by
evaluating the NIST PQDSS round 1 and round 2 implementations. We reported 26
issues in total to the respective developers, and 5 of them have already been
fixed. We also discuss our different findings, as well as the benefits of
shortcomings of the different tools.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cities are experiencing significant warming and more frequent climate
extremes, raising risks for over 90% of Australians living in cities. Yet many
of our tools for climate prediction and projection lack accurate
representations of these environments. We also lack the observations and
datasets needed to evaluate model performance. This paper identifies critical
gaps in Australias current capability, showing how they undermine climate
impact and risk assessments in cities and may lead to poorly designed
adaptation and mitigation strategies. These gaps, and the recommendations to
address them, were identified through consultation with experts across research
institutes, universities, two ARC Centres of Excellence, federal and state
governments, and private agencies.
  Our recommendations span four key areas: city descriptive datasets,
integrated observations, fit for purpose models, and a coordinated community of
research and practice. Urgent action is needed to tailor models to Australia's
unique urban landscapes and climates. This requires comprehensive, nationally
consistent, high resolution datasets that capture the form, fabric, and
function of contemporary and future cities. It also requires filling systematic
gaps in integrated networks of urban climate observations for evaluation and
benchmarking. At the same time, scientific understanding of key urban processes
that influence weather and climate must advance, alongside improvements in
their representation in physical models. This can be achieved through a
national community of research and practice that codesigns and oversees an
implementation plan, integrated with infrastructure such as ACCESS NRI and
AURIN. Building this capability will enable us to answer critical questions
about the interaction between cities and climate, protecting Australias urban
populations and ensuring a resilient future.</p>

variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control

an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true

heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial

economic structure, climate sensitivity, and population exposure. Our results
demonstrate that both the NSCC and the global sum estimates are highly

pure rate of time preference and relative risk aversion. Compared to aggregated
single-sector approaches, the disaggregated model with uncertainty yields
higher values of the NSCC for low- and middle-income countries. The paper
contributes to the literature by quantifying how sector-specific

<p class='card-text'>Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Md Rownak Hossain Chowdhury, Mostafizur Rahman</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-04 03:14:16</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We introduce a mapping framework for deep learning inference that takes
advantage of predictable neural network behavior to plan both computation and
communication ahead of time. The framework generates a unified stream of
instructions and data, enabling the hardware to execute operations and route
information on its own, without frequent involvement from the host and with
minimal off-chip memory use. This naturally reduces reliance on I/O, off-chip
memory, and host control. By leveraging fine-grained message passing on a
programmable, message-based compute architecture, the framework keeps data
movement local and coordinates computation across the array using techniques
such as stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions.
Applied to VGG-19, the framework sustains high utilization (88 to 92 percent),
with over 97 percent of messages generated internally and nearly 89 percent of
time consumed on-chip transfers. Computation throughput scales beyond 1 TFLOP/s
on larger arrays, while traffic reductions from reuse and local aggregation
reach up to 100 MB per layer. Overall, the results highlight the effectiveness
of streaming-based computation and show how our mapper enables this execution
style by tightly coordinating data and instruction flow across the hardware.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-04 02:35:14</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

<p class='card-text'>Advanced driver assistance systems have improved comfort, safety, and
efficiency of modern vehicles. However, sensor limitations lead to noisy lane
estimates that pose a significant challenge in developing performant control
architectures. Lateral trajectory planning often employs an optimal control
formulation to maintain lane position and minimize steering effort. The
parameters are often tuned manually, which is a time-intensive procedure. This
paper presents an automatic parameter tuning method for lateral planning in
lane-keeping scenarios based on recorded data, while taking into account noisy
road estimates. By simulating the lateral vehicle behavior along a reference
curve, our approach efficiently optimizes planner parameters for automated
driving and demonstrates improved performance on previously unseen test data.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-03 19:18:02</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future
trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems.
While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity,
computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent
diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach
introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales
trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the
resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising
process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a
simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a
powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation
study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint
goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is
essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that
mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Understanding human mobility during disastrous events is crucial for
emergency planning and disaster management. Here, we develop a methodology
involving the construction of time-varying, multilayer networks in which edges
encode observed movements between spatial regions (census tracts) and network
layers encode different movement categories according to industry sectors
(e.g., visitations to schools, hospitals, and grocery stores). This approach
provides a rich characterization of human mobility, thereby complementing
studies examining the risk-aversion activities of evacuation and sheltering in
place. Focusing on the 2021 Texas winter storm as a case study which led to
many casualties, we find that people largely reduced their movements to
ambulatory healthcare services, restaurants, and schools, but prioritized
movements to grocery stores and gas stations. Additionally, we study the
predictability of nodes' in- and out-degrees in the multilayer networks, which
encode movements into and out of census tracts. We find that inward movements
are harder to predict than outward movements, and even more so during this
winter storm. Our findings about the reduction, prioritization, and
predictability of sector-specific human movements could inform mobility-related
decisions arising from future extreme weather events.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Brenier's fundamental theorem characterizes optimal transport plans for
measures $\mu, \nu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and quadratic distance costs in terms of
gradients of convex functions. In particular it guarantees the existence of
optimal transport maps for measures which are absolutely continuous wrt
Lebesgue measure.
  Our goal is to provide a version of this result for measures $P,Q$ on
$\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and costs given by the squared Wasserstein
distance $W_2^2(\mu, \nu)$. We characterize optimizers in terms of convexity of
the Lions lift. This is based on an observation which seems to be of
independent interest: the $c$-transform of a functional $\phi$, where $c(\mu,
\nu)$ denotes maximal covariance of $\mu, \nu$ corresponds precisely to the
Legendre transform of the Lions lift of $\phi$. Moreover we show that for
typical $P \in\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ the optimizer is unique and given by
a transport map. In the absence of a canonical reference measure on
$\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ we use a topological notion to make `typical'
precise. Specifically we show that the transport regular measures are of second
Baire category.
  A particular motivation for our article stems from the theory of adapted
transport where the adapted Wasserstein distance provides an adequate distance
between stochastic processes. In contrast to other metrics, the adapted
Wasserstein distance yields continuity of Doob-decomposition, optimal stopping
and stochastic control problems. Based on our results for measures on
$\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ we obtain a first Brenier-type theorem for the
adapted Wasserstein distance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Auto-bidding is central to computational advertising, achieving notable
commercial success by optimizing advertisers' bids within economic constraints.
Recently, large generative models show potential to revolutionize auto-bidding
by generating bids that could flexibly adapt to complex, competitive
environments. Among them, diffusers stand out for their ability to address
sparse-reward challenges by focusing on trajectory-level accumulated rewards,
as well as their explainable capability, i.e., planning a future trajectory of
states and executing bids accordingly. However, diffusers struggle with
generation uncertainty, particularly regarding dynamic legitimacy between
adjacent states, which can lead to poor bids and further cause significant loss
of ad impression opportunities when competing with other advertisers in a
highly competitive auction environment. To address it, we propose a Causal
auto-Bidding method based on a Diffusion completer-aligner framework, termed
CBD. Firstly, we augment the diffusion training process with an extra random
variable t, where the model observes t-length historical sequences with the
goal of completing the remaining sequence, thereby enhancing the generated
sequences' dynamic legitimacy. Then, we employ a trajectory-level return model
to refine the generated trajectories, aligning more closely with advertisers'
objectives. Experimental results across diverse settings demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves superior performance on large-scale auto-bidding
benchmarks, such as a 29.9% improvement in conversion value in the challenging
sparse-reward auction setting, but also delivers significant improvements on
the Kuaishou online advertising platform, including a 2.0% increase in target

<p class='card-text'>Intuitive Teleoperation interfaces are essential for mobile manipulation
robots to ensure high quality data collection while reducing operator workload.
A strong sense of embodiment combined with minimal physical and cognitive
demands not only enhances the user experience during large-scale data
collection, but also helps maintain data quality over extended periods. This
becomes especially crucial for challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation
tasks that require whole-body coordination. We compare two distinct robot
control paradigms: a coupled embodiment integrating arm manipulation and base
navigation functions, and a decoupled embodiment treating these systems as
separate control entities. Additionally, we evaluate two visual feedback
mechanisms: immersive virtual reality and conventional screen-based
visualization of the robot's field of view. These configurations were
systematically assessed across a complex, multi-stage task sequence requiring
integrated planning and execution. Our results show that the use of VR as a
feedback modality increases task completion time, cognitive workload, and
perceived effort of the teleoperator. Coupling manipulation and navigation
leads to a comparable workload on the user as decoupling the embodiments, while
preliminary experiments suggest that data acquired by coupled teleoperation
leads to better imitation learning performance. Our holistic view on intuitive
teleoperation interfaces provides valuable insight into collecting
high-quality, high-dimensional mobile manipulation data at scale with the human

<p class='card-text'>The growing adoption of generative AI in education highlights the need to
integrate established pedagogical principles into AI-assisted learning
environments. This study investigates the potential of metacognitive theory to
inform AI-assisted programming education through a hint system designed around
the metacognitive phases of planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Upon request,
the system can provide three types of AI-generated hints--planning, debugging,
and optimization--to guide students at different stages of problem-solving.
Through a study with 102 students in an introductory data science programming
course, we find that students perceive and engage with planning hints most
highly, whereas optimization hints are rarely requested. We observe a
consistent association between requesting planning hints and achieving higher
grades across question difficulty and student competency. However, when facing
harder tasks, students seek additional debugging but not more planning support.
These insights contribute to the growing field of AI-assisted programming
education by providing empirical evidence on the importance of pedagogical
principles in AI-assisted learning.</p>
