<p class='card-text'>Robot motion can have many goals. Depending on the task, we might optimize
for pose error, speed, collision, or similarity to a human demonstration.
Motivated by this, we present PyRoki: a modular, extensible, and cross-platform
toolkit for solving kinematic optimization problems. PyRoki couples an
interface for specifying kinematic variables and costs with an efficient
nonlinear least squares optimizer. Unlike existing tools, it is also
cross-platform: optimization runs natively on CPU, GPU, and TPU. In this paper,
we present (i) the design and implementation of PyRoki, (ii) motion retargeting
and planning case studies that highlight the advantages of PyRoki's modularity,
and (iii) optimization benchmarking, where PyRoki can be 1.4-1.7x faster and
converges to lower errors than cuRobo, an existing GPU-accelerated inverse
kinematics library.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-06 17:54:05</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required
for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume
purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly
alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are
affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to
a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or
movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total
population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are
validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings
demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the
critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external
environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation
shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling
and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in
deforested regions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Intelligent interaction with the real world requires robotic agents to
jointly reason over high-level plans and low-level controls. Task and motion
planning (TAMP) addresses this by combining symbolic planning and continuous
trajectory generation. Recently, foundation model approaches to TAMP have
presented impressive results, including fast planning times and the execution
of natural language instructions. Yet, the optimal interface between high-level
planning and low-level motion generation remains an open question: prior
approaches are limited by either too much abstraction (e.g., chaining
simplified skill primitives) or a lack thereof (e.g., direct joint angle
prediction). Our method introduces a novel technique employing a form of
meta-optimization to address these issues by: (i) using program search over
trajectory optimization problems as an interface between a foundation model and
robot control, and (ii) leveraging a zero-order method to optimize numerical
parameters in the foundation model output. Results on challenging object
manipulation and drawing tasks confirm that our proposed method improves over
prior TAMP approaches.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-06 17:00:32</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Motivated by the requirements for effectiveness and efficiency, path-speed
decomposition-based trajectory planning methods have widely been adopted for
autonomous driving applications. While a global route can be pre-computed
offline, real-time generation of adaptive local paths remains crucial.
Therefore, we present the Frenet Corridor Planner (FCP), an optimization-based
local path planning strategy for autonomous driving that ensures smooth and
safe navigation around obstacles. Modeling the vehicles as safety-augmented
bounding boxes and pedestrians as convex hulls in the Frenet space, our
approach defines a drivable corridor by determining the appropriate deviation
side for static obstacles. Thereafter, a modified space-domain bicycle
kinematics model enables path optimization for smoothness, boundary clearance,
and dynamic obstacle risk minimization. The optimized path is then passed to a
speed planner to generate the final trajectory. We validate FCP through
extensive simulations and real-world hardware experiments, demonstrating its
efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In human-agent teams, openly sharing goals is often assumed to enhance
planning, collaboration, and effectiveness. However, direct communication of
these goals is not always feasible, requiring teammates to infer their
partner's intentions through actions. Building on this, we investigate whether
an AI agent's ability to share its inferred understanding of a human teammate's
goals can improve task performance and perceived collaboration. Through an
experiment comparing three conditions-no recognition (NR), viable goals (VG),
and viable goals on-demand (VGod) - we find that while goal-sharing information
did not yield significant improvements in task performance or overall
satisfaction scores, thematic analysis suggests that it supported strategic
adaptations and subjective perceptions of collaboration. Cognitive load
assessments revealed no additional burden across conditions, highlighting the
challenge of balancing informativeness and simplicity in human-agent
interactions. These findings highlight the nuanced trade-off of goal-sharing:
while it fosters trust and enhances perceived collaboration, it can
occasionally hinder objective performance gains.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The dawn of embodied intelligence has ushered in an unprecedented imperative
for resilient, cognition-enabled multi-agent collaboration across
next-generation ecosystems, revolutionizing paradigms in autonomous
manufacturing, adaptive service robotics, and cyber-physical production
architectures. However, current robotic systems face significant limitations,
such as limited cross-embodiment adaptability, inefficient task scheduling, and
insufficient dynamic error correction. While End-to-end VLA models demonstrate
inadequate long-horizon planning and task generalization, hierarchical VLA
models suffer from a lack of cross-embodiment and multi-agent coordination
capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce RoboOS, the first
open-source embodied system built on a Brain-Cerebellum hierarchical
architecture, enabling a paradigm shift from single-agent to multi-agent
intelligence. Specifically, RoboOS consists of three key components: (1)
Embodied Brain Model (RoboBrain), a MLLM designed for global perception and
high-level decision-making; (2) Cerebellum Skill Library, a modular,
plug-and-play toolkit that facilitates seamless execution of multiple skills;
and (3) Real-Time Shared Memory, a spatiotemporal synchronization mechanism for
coordinating multi-agent states. By integrating hierarchical information flow,
RoboOS bridges Embodied Brain and Cerebellum Skill Library, facilitating robust
planning, scheduling, and error correction for long-horizon tasks, while
ensuring efficient multi-agent collaboration through Real-Time Shared Memory.
Furthermore, we enhance edge-cloud communication and cloud-based distributed
inference to facilitate high-frequency interactions and enable scalable
deployment. Extensive real-world experiments across various scenarios,
demonstrate RoboOS's versatility in supporting heterogeneous embodiments.

The full model, including neural components, is discretized using a high-order

in a large-scale nonlinear program (NLP) efficiently solved by state-of-the-art
NLP solvers such as Ipopt. This formulation enables simultaneous optimization

on a recent direct collocation-based method for Neural ODEs, we generalize to
PeNODEs, incorporate physical constraints, and present a custom, parallelized,

<p class='card-text'>Active stress models in cardiac biomechanics account for the mechanical
deformation caused by muscle activity, thus providing a link between the
electrophysiological and mechanical properties of the tissue. The accurate
assessment of active stress parameters is fundamental for a precise
understanding of myocardial function but remains difficult to achieve in a
clinical setting, especially when only displacement and strain data from
medical imaging modalities are available. This work investigates, through an
in-silico study, the application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
for inferring active contractility parameters in time-dependent cardiac
biomechanical models from these types of imaging data. In particular, by
parametrising the sought state and parameter field with two neural networks,
respectively, and formulating an energy minimisation problem to search for the
optimal network parameters, we are able to reconstruct in various settings
active stress fields in the presence of noise and with a high spatial
resolution. To this end, we also advance the vanilla PINN learning algorithm
with the use of adaptive weighting schemes, ad-hoc regularisation strategies,
Fourier features, and suitable network architectures. In addition, we
thoroughly analyse the influence of the loss weights in the reconstruction of
active stress parameters. Finally, we apply the method to the characterisation
of tissue inhomogeneities and detection of fibrotic scars in myocardial tissue.
This approach opens a new pathway to significantly improve the diagnosis,
treatment planning, and management of heart conditions associated with cardiac

<p class='card-text'>Robots will bring search and rescue (SaR) in disaster response to another
level, in case they can autonomously take over dangerous SaR tasks from humans.
A main challenge for autonomous SaR robots is to safely navigate in cluttered
environments with uncertainties, while avoiding static and moving obstacles. We
propose an integrated control framework for SaR robots in dynamic, uncertain
environments, including a computationally efficient heuristic motion planning
system that provides a nominal (assuming there are no uncertainties)
collision-free trajectory for SaR robots and a robust motion tracking system
that steers the robot to track this reference trajectory, taking into account
the impact of uncertainties. The control architecture guarantees a balanced
trade-off among various SaR objectives, while handling the hard constraints,
including safety. The results of various computer-based simulations, presented
in this paper, showed significant out-performance (of up to 42.3%) of the
proposed integrated control architecture compared to two commonly used
state-of-the-art methods (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree and Artificial

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous robots deployed in unknown search-and-rescue (SaR) environments
can significantly improve the efficiency of the mission by assisting in fast
localisation and rescue of the trapped victims. We propose a novel integrated
hierarchical control architecture, called model predictive fuzzy control
(MPFC), for autonomous mission planning of multi-robot SaR systems that should
efficiently map an unknown environment: We combine model predictive control
(MPC) and fuzzy logic control (FLC), where the robots are locally controlled by
computationally efficient FLC controllers, and the parameters of these local
controllers are tuned via a centralised MPC controller, in a regular or
event-triggered manner. The proposed architecture provides three main
advantages: (1) The control decisions are made by the FLC controllers, thus the
real-time computation time is affordable. (2) The centralised MPC controller
optimises the performance criteria with a global and predictive vision of the
system dynamics, and updates the parameters of the FLC controllers accordingly.
(3) FLC controllers are heuristic by nature and thus do not take into account
optimality in their decisions, while the tuned parameters via the MPC
controller can indirectly incorporate some level of optimality in local
decisions of the robots. A simulation environment for victim detection in a
disaster environment was designed in MATLAB using discrete, 2-D grid-based
models. While being comparable from the point of computational efficiency, the
integrated MPFC architecture improves the performance of the multi-robot SaR
system compared to decentralised FLC controllers. Moreover, the performance of
MPFC is comparable to the performance of centralised MPC for path planning of
SaR robots, whereas MPFC requires significantly less computational resources,
since the number of the optimisation variables in the control problem are
reduced.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate MRI-to-CT translation promises the integration of complementary
imaging information without the need for additional imaging sessions. Given the
practical challenges associated with acquiring paired MRI and CT scans, the
development of robust methods capable of leveraging unpaired datasets is
essential for advancing the MRI-to-CT translation. Current unpaired MRI-to-CT
translation methods, which predominantly rely on cycle consistency and
contrastive learning frameworks, frequently encounter challenges in accurately
translating anatomical features that are highly discernible on CT but less
distinguishable on MRI, such as bone structures. This limitation renders these
approaches less suitable for applications in radiation therapy, where precise
bone representation is essential for accurate treatment planning. To address
this challenge, we propose a path- and bone-contour regularized approach for
unpaired MRI-to-CT translation. In our method, MRI and CT images are projected
to a shared latent space, where the MRI-to-CT mapping is modeled as a
continuous flow governed by neural ordinary differential equations. The optimal
mapping is obtained by minimizing the transition path length of the flow. To
enhance the accuracy of translated bone structures, we introduce a trainable
neural network to generate bone contours from MRI and implement mechanisms to
directly and indirectly encourage the model to focus on bone contours and their
adjacent regions. Evaluations conducted on three datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing unpaired MRI-to-CT translation approaches,
achieving lower overall error rates. Moreover, in a downstream bone
segmentation task, our approach exhibits superior performance in preserving the
fidelity of bone structures. Our code is available at:

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous long-horizon mobile manipulation encompasses a multitude of
challenges, including scene dynamics, unexplored areas, and error recovery.
Recent works have leveraged foundation models for scene-level robotic reasoning
and planning. However, the performance of these methods degrades when dealing
with a large number of objects and large-scale environments. To address these
limitations, we propose MORE, a novel approach for enhancing the capabilities
of language models to solve zero-shot mobile manipulation planning for
rearrangement tasks. MORE leverages scene graphs to represent environments,
incorporates instance differentiation, and introduces an active filtering
scheme that extracts task-relevant subgraphs of object and region instances.
These steps yield a bounded planning problem, effectively mitigating
hallucinations and improving reliability. Additionally, we introduce several
enhancements that enable planning across both indoor and outdoor environments.
We evaluate MORE on 81 diverse rearrangement tasks from the BEHAVIOR-1K
benchmark, where it becomes the first approach to successfully solve a
significant share of the benchmark, outperforming recent foundation model-based
approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of our approach in
several complex real-world tasks, mimicking everyday activities. We make the
code publicly available at https://more-model.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Bloom filters are used in query processing to perform early data reduction
and improve query performance. The optimal query plan may be different when
Bloom filters are used, indicating the need for Bloom filter-aware query
optimization. To date, Bloom filter-aware query optimization has only been
incorporated in a top-down query optimizer and limited to snowflake queries. In
this paper, we show how Bloom filters can be incorporated in a bottom-up
cost-based query optimizer. We highlight the challenges in limiting optimizer
search space expansion, and offer an efficient solution. We show that including
Bloom filters in cost-based optimization can lead to better join orders with
effective predicate transfer between operators. On a 100 GB instance of the
TPC-H database, our approach achieved a 32.8% further reduction in latency for
queries involving Bloom filters, compared to the traditional approach of adding
Bloom filters in a separate post-optimization step. Our method applies to all
query types, and we provide several heuristics to balance limited increases in
optimization time against improved query latency.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-05 18:13:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Understanding urban form is crucial for sustainable urban planning and
enhancing quality of life. This study presents a data-driven framework to
systematically identify and compare urban typologies across geographically and
culturally distinct cities. Using open-source geospatial data from
OpenStreetMap, we extracted multidimensional features related to topography,
multimodality, green spaces, and points of interest for the cities of Lausanne,
Switzerland, and Philadelphia, USA. A grid-based approach was used to divide
each city into Basic Spatial Units (BSU), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
were applied to cluster BSUs based on their urban characteristics. The results
reveal coherent and interpretable urban typologies within each city, with some
cluster types emerging across both cities despite their differences in scale,
density, and cultural context. Comparative analysis showed that adapting the
grid size to each city's morphology improves the detection of shared
typologies. Simplified clustering based solely on network degree centrality
further demonstrated that meaningful structural patterns can be captured even
with minimal feature sets. Our findings suggest the presence of functionally
convergent urban forms across continents and highlight the importance of
spatial scale in cross-city comparisons. The framework offers a scalable and
transferable approach for urban analysis, providing valuable insights for
planners and policymakers aiming to enhance walkability, accessibility, and
well-being. Limitations related to data completeness and feature selection are
discussed, and directions for future work -- including the integration of
additional data sources and human-centered validation -- are proposed.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-05 12:15:01</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Traditional rebalancing methods in ride-hailing systems direct idle drivers
to fixed destinations, overlooking the fact that ride allocations frequently
occur while cruising. This destination-centric view fails to exploit the
path-dependent nature of modern platforms, where real-time matching depends on
the entire trajectory rather than a static endpoint. We propose the Wise Goose
Chase (WGC) algorithm, an event-triggered, driver-specific path planning
framework that anticipates future matching opportunities by forecasting
spatio-temporal supply and demand dynamics. WGC uses a system of Retarded
Functional Differential Equations (RFDEs) to model the evolution of idle driver
density and passenger queues at the road-segment level, incorporating both
en-route matching and competition among drivers. Upon request, WGC computes
personalized cruising paths that minimize each driver's expected time to
allocation. Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic urban networks show that WGC
consistently outperforms baseline strategies, highlighting the advantage of
predictive, context-aware rebalancing in dynamic mobility systems.</p>

  Cancer Survival Prediction</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-05 10:10:03</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Cancer survival prediction using multi-modal medical imaging presents a
critical challenge in oncology, mainly due to the vulnerability of deep
learning models to noise and protocol variations across imaging centers.
Current approaches struggle to extract consistent features from heterogeneous
CT and PET images, limiting their clinical applicability. We address these
challenges by introducing RobSurv, a robust deep-learning framework that
leverages vector quantization for resilient multi-modal feature learning. The
key innovation of our approach lies in its dual-path architecture: one path
maps continuous imaging features to learned discrete codebooks for
noise-resistant representation, while the parallel path preserves fine-grained
details through continuous feature processing. This dual representation is
integrated through a novel patch-wise fusion mechanism that maintains local
spatial relationships while capturing global context via Transformer-based
processing. In extensive evaluations across three diverse datasets (HECKTOR,
H\&N1, and NSCLC Radiogenomics), RobSurv demonstrates superior performance,
achieving concordance index of 0.771, 0.742, and 0.734 respectively -
significantly outperforming existing methods. Most notably, our model maintains
robust performance even under severe noise conditions, with performance
degradation of only 3.8-4.5\% compared to 8-12\% in baseline methods. These
results, combined with strong generalization across different cancer types and
imaging protocols, establish RobSurv as a promising solution for reliable
clinical prognosis that can enhance treatment planning and patient care.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-05 07:58:54</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We propose FairPO, a novel framework designed to promote fairness in
multi-label classification by directly optimizing preference signals with a
group robustness perspective. In our framework, the set of labels is
partitioned into privileged and non-privileged groups, and a preference-based
loss inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is employed to more
effectively differentiate true positive labels from confusing negatives within
the privileged group, while preserving baseline classification performance for
non-privileged labels. By framing the learning problem as a robust optimization
over groups, our approach dynamically adjusts the training emphasis toward
groups with poorer performance, thereby mitigating bias and ensuring a fairer
treatment across diverse label categories. In addition, we outline plans to
extend this approach by investigating alternative loss formulations such as
Simple Preference Optimisation (SimPO) and Contrastive Preference Optimization
(CPO) to exploit reference-free reward formulations and contrastive training
signals. Furthermore, we plan to extend FairPO with multilabel generation
capabilities, enabling the model to dynamically generate diverse and coherent
label sets for ambiguous inputs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We present a real-time safety filter for motion planning, such as
learning-based methods, using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), which provides
formal guarantees for collision avoidance with road boundaries. A key feature
of our approach is its ability to directly incorporate road geometries of
arbitrary shape without resorting to conservative overapproximations. We
formulate the safety filter as a constrained optimization problem in the form
of a Quadratic Program (QP). It achieves safety by making minimal, necessary
adjustments to the control actions issued by the nominal motion planner. We
validate our safety filter through extensive numerical experiments across a
variety of traffic scenarios featuring complex roads. The results confirm its
reliable safety and high computational efficiency (execution frequency up to 40

<p class='card-text'>Designing dynamically feasible trajectories for rigid bodies is a fundamental
problem in robotics. Although direct trajectory optimization is widely applied
to solve this problem, inappropriate parameterizations of rigid body dynamics
often result in slow convergence and violations of the intrinsic topological
structure of the rotation group. This paper introduces a Riemannian
optimization framework for direct trajectory optimization of rigid bodies. We
first use the Lie Group Variational Integrator to formulate the discrete rigid
body dynamics on matrix Lie groups. We then derive the closed-form first- and
second-order Riemannian derivatives of the dynamics. Finally, this work applies
a line-search Riemannian Interior Point Method (RIPM) to perform trajectory
optimization with general nonlinear constraints. As the optimization is
performed on matrix Lie groups, it is correct-by-construction to respect the
topological structure of the rotation group and be free of singularities. The
paper demonstrates that both the derivative evaluations and Newton steps
required to solve the RIPM exhibit linear complexity with respect to the
planning horizon and system degrees of freedom. Simulation results illustrate
that the proposed method is faster than conventional methods by an order of
magnitude in challenging robotics tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>What is a good local description of contact dynamics for contact-rich
manipulation, and where can we trust this local description? While many
approaches often rely on the Taylor approximation of dynamics with an
ellipsoidal trust region, we argue that such approaches are fundamentally
inconsistent with the unilateral nature of contact. As a remedy, we present the
Contact Trust Region (CTR), which captures the unilateral nature of contact
while remaining efficient for computation. With CTR, we first develop a
Model-Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm capable of synthesizing local
contact-rich plans. Then, we extend this capability to plan globally by
stitching together local MPC plans, enabling efficient and dexterous
contact-rich manipulation. To verify the performance of our method, we perform
comprehensive evaluations, both in high-fidelity simulation and on hardware, on
two contact-rich systems: a planar IiwaBimanual system and a 3D AllegroHand
system. On both systems, our method offers a significantly lower-compute
alternative to existing RL-based approaches to contact-rich manipulation. In
particular, our Allegro in-hand manipulation policy, in the form of a roadmap,
takes fewer than 10 minutes to build offline on a standard laptop using just
its CPU, with online inference taking just a few seconds. Experiment data,

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-04 23:12:27</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Urban freshwater ecosystems, composed of rivers, ponds, lakes, and other
water bodies, have essential socioeconomic and ecological values for urban
residents. However, research investigating how individuals interact with lakes
remains limited, especially within cities and at fine spatiotemporal
resolutions. To fill this gap, we propose a data-driven analytical framework
that comprehensively senses human-lake interactions and profiles the
social-demographic characteristics of intra-city lakes. The term "lakeplace" is
proposed to depict a place containing lakes and human activities within it. For
each lake, the geographic boundary of its lakeplace refers to the first-order
administrative units, reflecting the neighboring scale of lake socioeconomics.
Utilizing large-scale individual mobile positioning data, we performed
lakeplace sensing on the 2,036 major lakes in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area
(TCMA), Minnesota, and the people interacting with them. The popularity of each
lakeplace was measured by its temporal visitations and further categorized as
on-lake and around-lake human activities. Popular lakeplaces were investigated
to depict whether the attractiveness of a lake is mostly brought by the lake
itself, or the social-demographic environment around it. The lakeplace sensing
framework offers a practical approach to the spatiotemporal characteristics of
human activities and understanding the social-demographic knowledge related to
human-lake systems. Our work exemplifies the social sensing of
human-environment interactions via geospatial big data, shedding light on
human-oriented sustainable urban planning and urban water resource management.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-04 22:45:46</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Query optimization is critical in relational databases. Recently, numerous
Learned Query Optimizers (LQOs) have been proposed, demonstrating superior
performance over traditional hand-crafted query optimizers after short training
periods. However, the opacity and instability of machine learning models have
limited their practical applications. To address this issue, we are the first
to formulate the LQO verification as a Conformal Prediction (CP) problem. We
first construct the CP model and obtain user-controlled bounded ranges for the
actual latency of LQO plans before execution. Then, we introduce CP-based
runtime verification along with violation handling to ensure performance prior
to execution. For both scenarios, we further extend our framework to handle
distribution shifts in the dynamic environment using adaptive CP approaches.
Finally, we present CP-guided plan search, which uses actual latency upper
bounds from CP to heuristically guide query plan construction. We integrated
our verification framework into three LQOs (Balsa, Lero, and RTOS) and
conducted evaluations on the JOB and TPC-H workloads. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method is both accurate and efficient. Our CP-based
approaches achieve tight upper bounds, reliably detect and handle violations.
Adaptive CP maintains accurate confidence levels even in the presence of
distribution shifts, and the CP-guided plan search improves both query plan
quality (up to 9.84x) and planning time, with a reduction of up to 74.4% for a
single query and 9.96% across all test queries from trained LQOs.</p>
