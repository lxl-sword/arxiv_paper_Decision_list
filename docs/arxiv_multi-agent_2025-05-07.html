  Framework for Mitigating Delayed Observation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Songchen Fu, Siang Chen, Shaojing Zhao, Letian Bai, Ta Li, Yonghong Yan</h6>

<p class='card-text'>In real-world multi-agent systems (MASs), observation delays are ubiquitous,
preventing agents from making decisions based on the environment's true state.
An individual agent's local observation often consists of multiple components
from other agents or dynamic entities in the environment. These discrete
observation components with varying delay characteristics pose significant
challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In this paper, we
first formulate the decentralized stochastic individual delay partially
observable Markov decision process (DSID-POMDP) by extending the standard
Dec-POMDP. We then propose the Rainbow Delay Compensation (RDC), a MARL
training framework for addressing stochastic individual delays, along with
recommended implementations for its constituent modules. We implement the
DSID-POMDP's observation generation pattern using standard MARL benchmarks,
including MPE and SMAC. Experiments demonstrate that baseline MARL methods
suffer severe performance degradation under fixed and unfixed delays. The
RDC-enhanced approach mitigates this issue, remarkably achieving ideal
delay-free performance in certain delay scenarios while maintaining
generalization capability. Our work provides a novel perspective on multi-agent
delayed observation problems and offers an effective solution framework.</p>

  Teleoperated Driving</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Giacomo Avanzi, Marco Giordani, Michele Zorzi</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-06 14:11:21</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The teleoperated driving (TD) scenario comes with stringent Quality of
Service (QoS) communication constraints, especially in terms of end-to-end
(E2E) latency and reliability. In this context, Predictive Quality of Service
(PQoS), possibly combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, is a
powerful tool to estimate QoS degradation and react accordingly. For example,
an intelligent agent can be trained to select the optimal compression
configuration for automotive data, and reduce the file size whenever QoS
conditions deteriorate. However, compression may inevitably compromise data
quality, with negative implications for the TD application. An alternative
strategy involves operating at the Radio Access Network (RAN) level to optimize
radio parameters based on current network conditions, while preserving data
quality. In this paper, we propose Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
scheduling algorithms, based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to
dynamically and intelligently allocate radio resources to minimize E2E latency
in a TD scenario. We evaluate two training paradigms, i.e., decentralized
learning with local observations (IPPO) vs. centralized aggregation (MAPPO), in
conjunction with two resource allocation strategies, i.e., proportional
allocation (PA) and greedy allocation (GA). We prove via ns-3 simulations that
MAPPO, combined with GA, achieves the best results in terms of latency,
especially as the number of vehicles increases.</p>

  Learning</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-06 13:41:59</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Judicious resource allocation can effectively enhance federated learning (FL)
training performance in wireless networks by addressing both system and
statistical heterogeneity. However, existing strategies typically rely on block
fading assumptions, which overlooks rapid channel fluctuations within each
round of FL gradient uploading, leading to a degradation in FL training
performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a small-scale-fading-aware resource
allocation strategy using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
framework. Specifically, we establish a one-step convergence bound of the FL
algorithm and formulate the resource allocation problem as a decentralized
partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which is subsequently
solved using the QMIX algorithm. In our framework, each client serves as an
agent that dynamically determines spectrum and power allocations within each
coherence time slot, based on local observations and a reward derived from the
convergence analysis. The MARL setting reduces the dimensionality of the action
space and facilitates decentralized decision-making, enhancing the scalability
and practicality of the solution. Experimental results demonstrate that our
QMIX-based resource allocation strategy significantly outperforms baseline
methods across various degrees of statistical heterogeneity. Additionally,
ablation studies validate the critical importance of incorporating small-scale
fading dynamics, highlighting its role in optimizing FL performance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Preventing collisions in multi-robot navigation is crucial for deployment.
This requirement hinders the use of learning-based approaches, such as
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), on their own due to their lack of
safety guarantees. Traditional control methods, such as reachability and
control barrier functions, can provide rigorous safety guarantees when
interactions are limited only to a small number of robots. However, conflicts
between the constraints faced by different agents pose a challenge to safe
multi-agent coordination.
  To overcome this challenge, we propose a method that integrates multiple
layers of safety by combining MARL with safety filters. First, MARL is used to
learn strategies that minimize multiple agent interactions, where multiple
indicates more than two. Particularly, we focus on interactions likely to
result in conflicting constraints within the engagement distance. Next, for
agents that enter the engagement distance, we prioritize pairs requiring the
most urgent corrective actions. Finally, a dedicated safety filter provides
tactical corrective actions to resolve these conflicts. Crucially, the design
decisions for all layers of this framework are grounded in reachability
analysis and a control barrier-value function-based filtering mechanism.
  We validate our Layered Safe MARL framework in 1) hardware experiments using
Crazyflie drones and 2) high-density advanced aerial mobility (AAM) operation
scenarios, where agents navigate to designated waypoints while avoiding
collisions. The results show that our method significantly reduces conflict
while maintaining safety without sacrificing much efficiency (i.e., shorter
travel time and distance) compared to baselines that do not incorporate layered
safety. The project website is available at

<p class='card-text'>Achieving resilience remains a significant challenge for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) communications in 5G and 6G networks. Although UAVs benefit from
superior positioning capabilities, rate optimization techniques, and extensive
line-of-sight (LoS) range, these advantages alone cannot guarantee high
reliability across diverse UAV use cases. This limitation becomes particularly
evident in urban environments, where UAVs face vulnerability to jamming attacks
and where LoS connectivity is frequently compromised by buildings and other
physical obstructions. This paper introduces DET-FAIR- WINGS (
Detection-Enhanced Transformer Framework for AI-Resilient Wireless Networks in
Ground UAV Systems), a novel solution designed to enhance reliability in UAV
communications under attacks. Our system leverages multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) and transformer-based detection algorithms to identify attack
patterns within the network and subsequently select the most appropriate
mechanisms to strengthen reliability in authenticated UAV-Base Station links.
The DET-FAIR-WINGS approach integrates both discrete and continuous parameters.
Discrete parameters include retransmission attempts, bandwidth partitioning,
and notching mechanisms, while continuous parameters encompass beam angles and
elevations from both the Base Station (BS) and user devices. The detection part
integrates a transformer in the agents to speed up training. Our findings
demonstrate that replacing fixed retransmission counts with AI-integrated
flexible approaches in 5G networks significantly reduces latency by optimizing
decision-making processes within 5G layers.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We present a reinforcement learning strategy for use in multi-agent foraging
systems in which the learning is centralised to a single agent and its model is
periodically disseminated among the population of non-learning agents. In a
domain where multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the common approach,
this approach aims to significantly reduce the computational and energy demands
compared to approaches such as MARL and centralised learning models. By
developing high performing foraging agents, these approaches can be translated
into real-world applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and
autonomous exploration. A reward function was incorporated into this approach
that promotes role development among agents, without explicit directives. This
led to the differentiation of behaviours among the agents. The implicit
encouragement of role differentiation allows for dynamic actions in which
agents can alter roles dependent on their interactions with the environment
without the need for explicit communication between agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Lane changing is a complex decision-making problem for Connected and
Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) as it requires balancing traffic efficiency with
safety. Although traffic efficiency can be improved by using vehicular
communication for training lane change controllers using Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL), ensuring safety is difficult. To address this
issue, we propose a decentralised Hybrid Safety Shield (HSS) that combines
optimisation and a rule-based approach to guarantee safety. Our method applies
control barrier functions to constrain longitudinal and lateral control inputs
of a CAV to ensure safe manoeuvres. Additionally, we present an architecture to
integrate HSS with MARL, called MARL-HSS, to improve traffic efficiency while
ensuring safety. We evaluate MARL-HSS using a gym-like environment that
simulates an on-ramp merging scenario with two levels of traffic densities,
such as light and moderate densities. The results show that HSS provides a
safety guarantee by strictly enforcing a dynamic safety constraint defined on a
time headway, even in moderate traffic density that offers challenging lane
change scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method learns stable policies compared
to the baseline, a state-of-the-art MARL lane change controller without a
safety shield. Further policy evaluation shows that our method achieves a
balance between safety and traffic efficiency with zero crashes and comparable
average speeds in light and moderate traffic densities.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-30 03:14:50</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In typical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems, communication
is important for agents to share information and make the right decisions.
However, due to the complexity of training multi-agent communication, existing
methods often fall into the dilemma of local optimization, which leads to the
concentration of communication in a limited number of channels and presents an
unbalanced structure. Such unbalanced communication policy are vulnerable to
abnormal conditions, where the damage of critical communication channels can
trigger the crash of the entire system. Inspired by decentralization theory in
sociology, we propose DMAC, which enhances the robustness of multi-agent
communication policies by retraining them into decentralized patterns.
Specifically, we train an adversary DMAC\_Adv which can dynamically identify
and mask the critical communication channels, and then apply the adversarial
samples generated by DMAC\_Adv to the adversarial learning of the communication
policy to force the policy in exploring other potential communication schemes
and transition to a decentralized structure. As a training method to improve
robustness, DMAC can be fused with any learnable communication policy
algorithm. The experimental results in two communication policies and four
multi-agent tasks demonstrate that DMAC achieves higher improvement on
robustness and performance of communication policy compared with two
state-of-the-art and commonly-used baselines. Also, the results demonstrate
that DMAC can achieve decentralized communication structure with acceptable
communication cost.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Modern renewables-based power systems need to tap on the flexibility of
Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) connected to distribution networks. It is
important, however, that DER owners/users remain in control of their assets,
decisions, and objectives. At the same time, the dynamic landscape of
DER-penetrated distribution networks calls for agile, data-driven flexibility
management frameworks. In the face of these developments, the Multi-Agent

distributed and data-driven decision-making policy. This paper addresses the
need for bottom-up DER management decisions to account for the distribution

<p class='card-text'>O-RAN (Open-Radio Access Network) offers a flexible, open architecture for
next-generation wireless networks. Network slicing within O-RAN allows network
operators to create customized virtual networks, each tailored to meet the
specific needs of a particular application or service. Efficiently managing
these slices is crucial for future 6G networks. O-RAN introduces specialized
software applications called xApps that manage different network functions. In
network slicing, an xApp can be responsible for managing a separate network
slice. To optimize resource allocation across numerous network slices, these
xApps must coordinate. Traditional methods where all xApps communicate freely
can lead to excessive overhead, hindering network performance. In this paper,
we address the issue of xApp conflict mitigation by proposing an innovative
Zero-Touch Management (ZTM) solution for radio resource management in O-RAN.
Our approach leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to enable
xApps to learn and optimize resource allocation without the need for constant
manual intervention. We introduce a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based
attention mechanism to streamline communication among xApps, reducing overhead
and improving overall system efficiency. Our results compare traditional MARL,
where all xApps communicate, against our MARL GCN-based attention method. The
findings demonstrate the superiority of our approach, especially as the number

<p class='card-text'>Tasks for multi-robot systems often require the robots to collaborate and

formalized as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which targets
minimizing a global cost and bringing the mean of constraint violation below a

safety as zero constraint violation. While many safe multi-agent reinforcement

suffer from unstable training in this setting. To tackle this, we use the
epigraph form for constrained optimization to improve training stability and
prove that the centralized epigraph form problem can be solved in a distributed
fashion by each agent. This results in a novel centralized training distributed

sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for
its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has
investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques.
Moreover, the direct application of MARL methodologies to LaMAS introduces
significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms

comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a universal

key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We begin by
reviewing the evolution from RL to Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, setting the stage
for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we
elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences
motivate a transition toward a novel, LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT.
Central to this work is the presentation of a robust and scalable MARFT

them, they often face limitations in generalizing across scales and physical
systems. We present a novel, data-driven, multiagent reinforcement learning
(MARL) approach that drastically improves stability and accuracy of
coarse-grained LBM simulations. The proposed method uses a convolutional neural
network to dynamically control the local relaxation parameter for the LB across
the simulation grid. The LB-MARL framework is showcased in turbulent Kolmogorov
flows. We find that the MARL closures stabilize the simulations and recover the
energy spectra of significantly more expensive fully resolved simulations while
maintaining computational efficiency. The learned closure model can be
transferred to flow scenarios unseen during training and has improved
robustness and spectral accuracy compared to traditional LBM models. We believe
that MARL closures open new frontiers for efficient and accurate simulations of
a multitude of complex problems not accessible to present-day LB methods alone.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In cellular networks, cell handover refers to the process where a device
switches from one base station to another, and this mechanism is crucial for
balancing the load among different cells. Traditionally, engineers would
manually adjust parameters based on experience. However, the explosive growth
in the number of cells has rendered manual tuning impractical. Existing
research tends to overlook critical engineering details in order to simplify
handover problems. In this paper, we classify cell handover into three types,
and jointly model their mutual influence. To achieve load balancing, we propose
a multi-agent-reinforcement-learning (MARL)-based scheme to automatically
optimize the parameters. To reduce the agent interaction costs, a distributed
training is implemented based on consensus approximation of global average
load, and it is shown that the approximation error is bounded. Experimental
results show that our proposed scheme outperforms existing benchmarks in
balancing load and improving network performance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Credit assignment has remained a fundamental challenge in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Previous studies have primarily addressed this
issue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with
decentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to
approximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the
global Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in
various benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including
imprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor
scalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel algorithm, \textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic
construction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs).
Specifically, the concept of \textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit
allocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear
functional formulation. A custom-designed \textit{coder-evaluator} framework is
further employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of
executable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination
and shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on
several standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM
exhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a
wide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a
promising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Climate policy development faces significant challenges due to deep
uncertainty, complex system dynamics, and competing stakeholder interests.
Climate simulation methods, such as Earth System Models, have become valuable
tools for policy exploration. However, their typical use is for evaluating
potential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be
inverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization
approaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and
comprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting
climate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address
these limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate
simulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis,
including reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state
spaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation.
Additionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions
interpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation
for more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important
limitations and areas for future research.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for adaptive
traffic signal control (ATSC), enabling multiple intersections to coordinate
signal timings in real time. However, in large-scale settings, MARL faces
constraints due to extensive data sharing and communication requirements.
Federated learning (FL) mitigates these challenges by training shared models
without directly exchanging raw data, yet traditional FL methods such as FedAvg
struggle with highly heterogeneous intersections. Different intersections
exhibit varying traffic patterns, demands, and road structures, so performing
FedAvg across all agents is inefficient. To address this gap, we propose
Hierarchical Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL) for ATSC. HFRL employs
clustering-based or optimization-based techniques to dynamically group
intersections and perform FedAvg independently within groups of intersections
with similar characteristics, enabling more effective coordination and
scalability than standard FedAvg. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world
traffic networks demonstrate that HFRL not only outperforms both decentralized
and standard federated RL approaches but also identifies suitable grouping
patterns based on network structure or traffic demand, resulting in a more
robust framework for distributed, heterogeneous systems.</p>

  Multi-agent task allocation (MATA) plays a vital role in cooperative
multi-agent systems, with significant implications for applications such as
logistics, search and rescue, and robotic coordination. Although traditional
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been shown to be promising,
their effectiveness is hindered by a reliance on manually designed reward
functions and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. In this paper, an inverse
reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework is proposed, in which multi-head
self-attention (MHSA) and graph attention mechanisms are incorporated to
enhance reward function learning and task execution efficiency. Expert
demonstrations are utilized to infer optimal reward densities, allowing
dependence on handcrafted designs to be reduced and adaptability to be
improved. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method
over widely used multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in terms
of both cumulative rewards and task execution efficiency.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The continuous expansion of network data presents a pressing challenge for
conventional routing algorithms. As the demand escalates, these algorithms are
struggling to cope. In this context, reinforcement learning (RL) and
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms emerge as promising
solutions. However, the urgency and importance of the problem are clear, as
existing RL/MARL-based routing approaches lack effective communication in run
time among routers, making it challenging for individual routers to adapt to
complex and dynamic changing networks. More importantly, they lack the ability
to deal with dynamically changing network topology, especially the addition of
the router, due to the non-scalability of their neural networks. This paper
proposes a novel dynamic routing algorithm, DRAMA, incorporating emergent
communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Through emergent
communication, routers could learn how to communicate effectively to maximize
the optimization objectives. Meanwhile, a new Q-network and graph-based
emergent communication are introduced to dynamically adapt to the changing
network topology without retraining while ensuring robust performance.
Experimental results showcase DRAMA's superior performance over the traditional
routing algorithm and other RL/MARL-based algorithms, achieving a higher
delivery rate and lower latency in diverse network scenarios, including dynamic
network load and topology. Moreover, an ablation experiment validates the
prospect of emergent communication in facilitating packet routing.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The economic feasibility of nuclear microreactors will depend on minimizing
operating costs through advancements in autonomous control, especially when
these microreactors are operating alongside other types of energy systems
(e.g., renewable energy). This study explores the application of deep
reinforcement learning (RL) for real-time drum control in microreactors,
exploring performance in regard to load-following scenarios. By leveraging a
point kinetics model with thermal and xenon feedback, we first establish a
baseline using a single-output RL agent, then compare it against a traditional
proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. This study demonstrates that
RL controllers, including both single- and multi-agent RL (MARL) frameworks,
can achieve similar or even superior load-following performance as traditional
PID control across a range of load-following scenarios. In short transients,
the RL agent was able to reduce the tracking error rate in comparison to PID.
Over extended 300-minute load-following scenarios in which xenon feedback
becomes a dominant factor, PID maintained better accuracy, but RL still
remained within a 1% error margin despite being trained only on short-duration
scenarios. This highlights RL's strong ability to generalize and extrapolate to
longer, more complex transients, affording substantial reductions in training
costs and reduced overfitting. Furthermore, when control was extended to
multiple drums, MARL enabled independent drum control as well as maintained
reactor symmetry constraints without sacrificing performance -- an objective
that standard single-agent RL could not learn. We also found that, as
increasing levels of Gaussian noise were added to the power measurements, the
RL controllers were able to maintain lower error rates than PID, and to do so
with less control effort.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Traffic congestion in modern cities is exacerbated by the limitations of
traditional fixed-time traffic signal systems, which fail to adapt to dynamic
traffic patterns. Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) algorithms have
emerged as a solution by dynamically adjusting signal timing based on real-time
traffic conditions. However, the main limitation of such methods is that they
are not transferable to environments under real-world constraints, such as
balancing efficiency, minimizing collisions, and ensuring fairness across
intersections. In this paper, we view the ATSC problem as a constrained
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a novel algorithm
named Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Lagrange Cost Estimator
(MAPPO-LCE) to produce effective traffic signal control policies. Our approach
integrates the Lagrange multipliers method to balance rewards and constraints,
with a cost estimator for stable adjustment. We also introduce three
constraints on the traffic network: GreenTime, GreenSkip, and PhaseSkip, which
penalize traffic policies that do not conform to real-world scenarios. Our
experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MAPPO-LCE
outperforms three baseline MARL algorithms by across all environments and
traffic constraints (improving on MAPPO by 12.60%, IPPO by 10.29%, and QTRAN by
13.10%). Our results show that constrained MARL is a valuable tool for traffic
planners to deploy scalable and efficient ATSC methods in real-world traffic
networks. We provide code at https://github.com/Asatheesh6561/MAPPO-LCE.</p>

and goals, we aim to enhance both the explainability and control of agent

focuses on individual agents. Additionally, our framework includes a
post-training analysis method to infer implicit roles and goals, offering

<p class='card-text'>Markov games (MGs) serve as the mathematical foundation for multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), enabling self-interested agents to learn their
optimal policies while interacting with others in a shared environment.
However, due to the complexities of an MG problem, seeking (Markov perfect)
Nash equilibrium (NE) is often very challenging for a general-sum MG. Markov
potential games (MPGs), which are a special class of MGs, have appealing
properties such as guaranteed existence of pure NEs and guaranteed convergence
of gradient play algorithms, thereby leading to desirable properties for many
MARL algorithms in their NE-seeking processes. However, the question of how to
construct MPGs has been open. This paper provides sufficient conditions on the
reward design and on the Markov decision process (MDP), under which an MG is an
MPG. Numerical results on autonomous driving applications are reported.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Learning cooperative multi-agent policy from offline multi-task data that can
generalize to unseen tasks with varying numbers of agents and targets is an
attractive problem in many scenarios. Although aggregating general behavior
patterns among multiple tasks as skills to improve policy transfer is a
promising approach, two primary challenges hinder the further advancement of
skill learning in offline multi-task MARL. Firstly, extracting general
cooperative behaviors from various action sequences as common skills lacks
bringing cooperative temporal knowledge into them. Secondly, existing works
only involve common skills and can not adaptively choose independent knowledge
as task-specific skills in each task for fine-grained action execution. To
tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical and Separate Skill Discovery
(HiSSD), a novel approach for generalizable offline multi-task MARL through
skill learning. HiSSD leverages a hierarchical framework that jointly learns
common and task-specific skills. The common skills learn cooperative temporal
knowledge and enable in-sample exploitation for offline multi-task MARL. The
task-specific skills represent the priors of each task and achieve a
task-guided fine-grained action execution. To verify the advancement of our
method, we conduct experiments on multi-agent MuJoCo and SMAC benchmarks. After
training the policy using HiSSD on offline multi-task data, the empirical
results show that HiSSD assigns effective cooperative behaviors and obtains
superior performance in unseen tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is increasingly ubiquitous in
training dynamic and adaptive synthetic characters for interactive simulations
on geo-specific terrains. Frameworks such as Unity's ML-Agents help to make
such reinforcement learning experiments more accessible to the simulation
community. Military training simulations also benefit from advances in MARL,
but they have immense computational requirements due to their complex,
continuous, stochastic, partially observable, non-stationary, and
doctrine-based nature. Furthermore, these simulations require geo-specific
terrains, further exacerbating the computational resources problem. In our
research, we leverage Unity's waypoints to automatically generate multi-layered
representation abstractions of the geo-specific terrains to scale up
reinforcement learning while still allowing the transfer of learned policies
between different representations. Our early exploratory results on a novel
MARL scenario, where each side has differing objectives, indicate that
waypoint-based navigation enables faster and more efficient learning while
producing trajectories similar to those taken by expert human players in CSGO
gaming environments. This research points out the potential of waypoint-based
navigation for reducing the computational costs of developing and training MARL
models for military training simulations, where geo-specific terrains and
