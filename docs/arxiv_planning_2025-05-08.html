<p class='card-text'>Model-based planning and execution systems offer a principled approach to
building flexible autonomous robots that can perform diverse tasks by
automatically combining a host of basic skills. This idea is almost as old as
modern robotics. Yet, while diverse general-purpose reasoning architectures
have been proposed since, general-purpose systems that are integrated with
modern robotic platforms have emerged only recently, starting with the
influential ROSPlan system. Since then, a growing number of model-based systems
for robot task-level control have emerged. In this paper, we consider the
diverse design choices and issues existing systems attempt to address, the
different solutions proposed so far, and suggest avenues for future
development.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-07 13:20:36</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The planning and operation of renewable energy, especially wind power, depend
crucially on accurate, timely, and high-resolution weather information.
Coarse-grid global numerical weather forecasts are typically downscaled to meet
these requirements, introducing challenges of scale inconsistency, process
representation error, computation cost, and entanglement of distinct
uncertainty sources from chaoticity, model bias, and large-scale forcing. We
address these challenges by learning the climatological distribution of a
target wind farm using its high-resolution numerical weather simulations. An
optimal combination of this learned high-resolution climatological prior with
coarse-grid large scale forecasts yields highly accurate, fine-grained,
full-variable, large ensemble of weather pattern forecasts. Using observed
meteorological records and wind turbine power outputs as references, the
proposed methodology verifies advantageously compared to existing
numerical/statistical forecasting-downscaling pipelines, regarding either
deterministic/probabilistic skills or economic gains. Moreover, a 100-member,
10-day forecast with spatial resolution of 1 km and output frequency of 15 min
takes < 1 hour on a moderate-end GPU, as contrast to $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ CPU
hours for conventional numerical simulation. By drastically reducing
computational costs while maintaining accuracy, our method paves the way for
more efficient and reliable renewable energy planning and operation.</p>

  Vehicle</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Petr Jahoda, Jan Cech</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-07 13:17:05</h6>
<p class='card-text'>A novel approach to detect road surface anomalies by visual tracking of a
preceding vehicle is proposed. The method is versatile, predicting any kind of
road anomalies, such as potholes, bumps, debris, etc., unlike direct
observation methods that rely on training visual detectors of those cases. The
method operates in low visibility conditions or in dense traffic where the
anomaly is occluded by a preceding vehicle. Anomalies are detected
predictively, i.e., before a vehicle encounters them, which allows to
pre-configure low-level vehicle systems (such as chassis) or to plan an
avoidance maneuver in case of autonomous driving. A challenge is that the
signal coming from camera-based tracking of a preceding vehicle may be weak and
disturbed by camera ego motion due to vibrations affecting the ego vehicle.
Therefore, we propose an efficient method to compensate camera pitch rotation
by an iterative robust estimator. Our experiments on both controlled setup and
normal traffic conditions show that road anomalies can be detected reliably at
a distance even in challenging cases where the ego vehicle traverses imperfect
road surfaces. The method is effective and performs in real time on standard
consumer hardware.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-07 12:03:15</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Machine Ethics decisions should consider the implications of uncertainty over
decisions. Decisions should be made over sequences of actions to reach
preferable outcomes long term. The evaluation of outcomes, however, may invoke
one or more moral theories, which might have conflicting judgements. Each
theory will require differing representations of the ethical situation. For
example, Utilitarianism measures numerical values, Deontology analyses duties,
and Virtue Ethics emphasises moral character. While balancing potentially
conflicting moral considerations, decisions may need to be made, for example,
to achieve morally neutral goals with minimal costs. In this paper, we
formalise the problem as a Multi-Moral Markov Decision Process and a
Multi-Moral Stochastic Shortest Path Problem. We develop a heuristic algorithm
based on Multi-Objective AO*, utilising Sven-Ove Hansson's Hypothetical
Retrospection procedure for ethical reasoning under uncertainty. Our approach
is validated by a case study from Machine Ethics literature: the problem of
whether to steal insulin for someone who needs it.</p>

  discrete optimal transport and general linear programs</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Shuyu Liu, Florentina Bunea, Jonathan Niles-Weed</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-07 10:55:14</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This work proposes new estimators for discrete optimal transport plans that
enjoy Gaussian limits centered at the true solution. This behavior stands in
stark contrast with the performance of existing estimators, including those
based on entropic regularization, which are asymptotically biased and only
satisfy a CLT centered at a regularized version of the population-level plan.
We develop a new regularization approach based on a different class of penalty
functions, which can be viewed as the duals of those previously considered in
the literature. The key feature of these penalty schemes it that they give rise
to preliminary estimates that are asymptotically linear in the penalization
strength. Our final estimator is obtained by constructing an appropriate linear
combination of two penalized solutions corresponding to two different tuning
parameters so that the bias introduced by the penalization cancels out. Unlike
classical debiasing procedures, therefore, our proposal entirely avoids the
delicate problem of estimating and then subtracting the estimated bias term.
Our proofs, which apply beyond the case of optimal transport, are based on a
novel asymptotic analysis of penalization schemes for linear programs. As a
corollary of our results, we obtain the consistency of the naive bootstrap for
fully data-driven inference on the true optimal solution. Simulation results
and two data analyses support strongly the benefits of our approach relative to
existing techniques.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cloud security concerns have been greatly realized in recent years due to the
increase of complicated threats in the computing world. Many traditional
solutions do not work well in real-time to detect or prevent more complex
threats. Artificial intelligence is today regarded as a revolution in
determining a protection plan for cloud data architecture through machine
learning, statistical visualization of computing infrastructure, and detection
of security breaches followed by counteraction. These AI-enabled systems make
work easier as more network activities are scrutinized, and any anomalous
behavior that might be a precursor to a more serious breach is prevented. This
paper examines ways AI can enhance cloud security by applying predictive
analytics, behavior-based security threat detection, and AI-stirring
encryption. It also outlines the problems of the previous security models and
how AI overcomes them. For a similar reason, issues like data privacy, biases
in the AI model, and regulatory compliance are also covered. So, AI improves
the protection of cloud computing contexts; however, more efforts are needed in
the subsequent phases to extend the technology's reliability, modularity, and
ethical aspects. This means that AI can be blended with other new computing
technologies, including blockchain, to improve security frameworks further. The
paper discusses the current trends in securing cloud data architecture using AI
and presents further research and application directions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Quadcopters are versatile aerial robots gaining popularity in numerous
critical applications. However, their operational effectiveness is constrained
by limited battery life and restricted flight range. To address these
challenges, autonomous drone landing on stationary or mobile charging and
battery-swapping stations has become an essential capability. In this study, we
present NMPC-Lander, a novel control architecture that integrates Nonlinear
Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with Control Barrier Functions (CBF) to achieve
precise and safe autonomous landing on both static and dynamic platforms. Our
approach employs NMPC for accurate trajectory tracking and landing, while
simultaneously incorporating CBF to ensure collision avoidance with static
obstacles. Experimental evaluations on the real hardware demonstrate high
precision in landing scenarios, with an average final position error of 9.0 cm

Motivated by this, we present PyRoki: a modular, extensible, and cross-platform

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-06 17:54:05</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required
for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume
purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly
alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are
affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to
a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or
movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total
population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are
validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings
demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the
critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external
environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation
shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling
and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in
deforested regions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Intelligent interaction with the real world requires robotic agents to
jointly reason over high-level plans and low-level controls. Task and motion
planning (TAMP) addresses this by combining symbolic planning and continuous
trajectory generation. Recently, foundation model approaches to TAMP have
presented impressive results, including fast planning times and the execution
of natural language instructions. Yet, the optimal interface between high-level
planning and low-level motion generation remains an open question: prior
approaches are limited by either too much abstraction (e.g., chaining
simplified skill primitives) or a lack thereof (e.g., direct joint angle
prediction). Our method introduces a novel technique employing a form of
meta-optimization to address these issues by: (i) using program search over
trajectory optimization problems as an interface between a foundation model and
robot control, and (ii) leveraging a zero-order method to optimize numerical
parameters in the foundation model output. Results on challenging object
manipulation and drawing tasks confirm that our proposed method improves over

offline, real-time generation of adaptive local paths remains crucial.
Therefore, we present the Frenet Corridor Planner (FCP), an optimization-based
local path planning strategy for autonomous driving that ensures smooth and
safe navigation around obstacles. Modeling the vehicles as safety-augmented

approach defines a drivable corridor by determining the appropriate deviation
side for static obstacles. Thereafter, a modified space-domain bicycle
kinematics model enables path optimization for smoothness, boundary clearance,

<p class='card-text'>In human-agent teams, openly sharing goals is often assumed to enhance
planning, collaboration, and effectiveness. However, direct communication of
these goals is not always feasible, requiring teammates to infer their
partner's intentions through actions. Building on this, we investigate whether
an AI agent's ability to share its inferred understanding of a human teammate's
goals can improve task performance and perceived collaboration. Through an
experiment comparing three conditions-no recognition (NR), viable goals (VG),
and viable goals on-demand (VGod) - we find that while goal-sharing information
did not yield significant improvements in task performance or overall
satisfaction scores, thematic analysis suggests that it supported strategic
adaptations and subjective perceptions of collaboration. Cognitive load
assessments revealed no additional burden across conditions, highlighting the
challenge of balancing informativeness and simplicity in human-agent

<p class='card-text'>The dawn of embodied intelligence has ushered in an unprecedented imperative
for resilient, cognition-enabled multi-agent collaboration across
next-generation ecosystems, revolutionizing paradigms in autonomous
manufacturing, adaptive service robotics, and cyber-physical production
architectures. However, current robotic systems face significant limitations,
such as limited cross-embodiment adaptability, inefficient task scheduling, and
insufficient dynamic error correction. While End-to-end VLA models demonstrate
inadequate long-horizon planning and task generalization, hierarchical VLA
models suffer from a lack of cross-embodiment and multi-agent coordination
capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce RoboOS, the first
open-source embodied system built on a Brain-Cerebellum hierarchical
architecture, enabling a paradigm shift from single-agent to multi-agent
intelligence. Specifically, RoboOS consists of three key components: (1)
Embodied Brain Model (RoboBrain), a MLLM designed for global perception and
high-level decision-making; (2) Cerebellum Skill Library, a modular,
plug-and-play toolkit that facilitates seamless execution of multiple skills;
and (3) Real-Time Shared Memory, a spatiotemporal synchronization mechanism for
coordinating multi-agent states. By integrating hierarchical information flow,
RoboOS bridges Embodied Brain and Cerebellum Skill Library, facilitating robust
planning, scheduling, and error correction for long-horizon tasks, while
ensuring efficient multi-agent collaboration through Real-Time Shared Memory.
Furthermore, we enhance edge-cloud communication and cloud-based distributed
inference to facilitate high-frequency interactions and enable scalable
deployment. Extensive real-world experiments across various scenarios,
demonstrate RoboOS's versatility in supporting heterogeneous embodiments.

<p class='card-text'>We propose a novel approach for training Physics-enhanced Neural ODEs
(PeNODEs) by expressing the training process as a dynamic optimization problem.
The full model, including neural components, is discretized using a high-order
implicit Runge-Kutta method with flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau points, resulting
in a large-scale nonlinear program (NLP) efficiently solved by state-of-the-art
NLP solvers such as Ipopt. This formulation enables simultaneous optimization
of network parameters and state trajectories, addressing key limitations of ODE
solver-based training in terms of stability, runtime, and accuracy. Extending
on a recent direct collocation-based method for Neural ODEs, we generalize to
PeNODEs, incorporate physical constraints, and present a custom, parallelized,
open-source implementation. Benchmarks on a Quarter Vehicle Model and a
Van-der-Pol oscillator demonstrate superior accuracy, speed, and generalization
with smaller networks compared to other training techniques. We also outline a
planned integration into OpenModelica to enable accessible training of Neural
DAEs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Ensuring the safe and efficient operation of CAVs relies heavily on the
software framework used. A software framework needs to ensure real-time
properties, reliable communication, and efficient resource utilization.
Furthermore, a software framework needs to enable seamless transition between
testing stages, from simulation to small-scale to full-scale experiments. In
this paper, we survey prominent software frameworks used for in-vehicle and
inter-vehicle communication in CAVs. We analyze these frameworks regarding
opportunities and challenges, such as their real-time properties and
transitioning capabilities. Additionally, we delve into the tooling
requirements necessary for addressing the associated challenges. We illustrate
the practical implications of these challenges through case studies focusing on
critical areas such as perception, motion planning, and control. Furthermore,
we identify research gaps in the field, highlighting areas where further
investigation is needed to advance the development and deployment of safe and
efficient CAV systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Active stress models in cardiac biomechanics account for the mechanical
deformation caused by muscle activity, thus providing a link between the
electrophysiological and mechanical properties of the tissue. The accurate
assessment of active stress parameters is fundamental for a precise
understanding of myocardial function but remains difficult to achieve in a
clinical setting, especially when only displacement and strain data from
medical imaging modalities are available. This work investigates, through an
in-silico study, the application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
for inferring active contractility parameters in time-dependent cardiac
biomechanical models from these types of imaging data. In particular, by
parametrising the sought state and parameter field with two neural networks,
respectively, and formulating an energy minimisation problem to search for the
optimal network parameters, we are able to reconstruct in various settings
active stress fields in the presence of noise and with a high spatial
resolution. To this end, we also advance the vanilla PINN learning algorithm
with the use of adaptive weighting schemes, ad-hoc regularisation strategies,
Fourier features, and suitable network architectures. In addition, we
thoroughly analyse the influence of the loss weights in the reconstruction of
active stress parameters. Finally, we apply the method to the characterisation
of tissue inhomogeneities and detection of fibrotic scars in myocardial tissue.
This approach opens a new pathway to significantly improve the diagnosis,
treatment planning, and management of heart conditions associated with cardiac
fibrosis.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Robots will bring search and rescue (SaR) in disaster response to another
level, in case they can autonomously take over dangerous SaR tasks from humans.
A main challenge for autonomous SaR robots is to safely navigate in cluttered
environments with uncertainties, while avoiding static and moving obstacles. We
propose an integrated control framework for SaR robots in dynamic, uncertain
environments, including a computationally efficient heuristic motion planning
system that provides a nominal (assuming there are no uncertainties)
collision-free trajectory for SaR robots and a robust motion tracking system
that steers the robot to track this reference trajectory, taking into account
the impact of uncertainties. The control architecture guarantees a balanced
trade-off among various SaR objectives, while handling the hard constraints,
including safety. The results of various computer-based simulations, presented
in this paper, showed significant out-performance (of up to 42.3%) of the
proposed integrated control architecture compared to two commonly used
state-of-the-art methods (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree and Artificial
Potential Function) in reaching targets (e.g., trapped victims in SaR) safely,
collision-free, and in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-06 07:37:04</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Autonomous robots deployed in unknown search-and-rescue (SaR) environments
can significantly improve the efficiency of the mission by assisting in fast
localisation and rescue of the trapped victims. We propose a novel integrated
hierarchical control architecture, called model predictive fuzzy control
(MPFC), for autonomous mission planning of multi-robot SaR systems that should
efficiently map an unknown environment: We combine model predictive control
(MPC) and fuzzy logic control (FLC), where the robots are locally controlled by
computationally efficient FLC controllers, and the parameters of these local
controllers are tuned via a centralised MPC controller, in a regular or
event-triggered manner. The proposed architecture provides three main
advantages: (1) The control decisions are made by the FLC controllers, thus the
real-time computation time is affordable. (2) The centralised MPC controller
optimises the performance criteria with a global and predictive vision of the
system dynamics, and updates the parameters of the FLC controllers accordingly.
(3) FLC controllers are heuristic by nature and thus do not take into account
optimality in their decisions, while the tuned parameters via the MPC
controller can indirectly incorporate some level of optimality in local
decisions of the robots. A simulation environment for victim detection in a
disaster environment was designed in MATLAB using discrete, 2-D grid-based
models. While being comparable from the point of computational efficiency, the
integrated MPFC architecture improves the performance of the multi-robot SaR
system compared to decentralised FLC controllers. Moreover, the performance of
MPFC is comparable to the performance of centralised MPC for path planning of
SaR robots, whereas MPFC requires significantly less computational resources,
since the number of the optimisation variables in the control problem are
reduced.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper addresses the problem of robot navigation in mixed geometric and
semantic 3D environments. Given a hierarchical representation of the
environment, the objective is to navigate from a start position to a goal while
minimizing the computational cost. We introduce Hierarchical Class-ordered A*
(HCOA*), an algorithm that leverages the environmental hierarchy for efficient
path-planning in semantic graphs, significantly reducing computational effort.
We use a total order over the semantic classes and prove theoretical
performance guarantees for the algorithm. We propose two approaches for
higher-layer node classification based on the node semantics of the lowest
layer: a Graph Neural Network-based method and a Majority-Class method. We
evaluate our approach through simulations on a 3D Scene Graph (3DSG), comparing
it to the state-of-the-art and assessing its performance against our
classification approaches. Results show that HCOA* can find the optimal path
while reducing the number of expanded nodes by 25% and achieving a 16%

<p class='card-text'>Accurate MRI-to-CT translation promises the integration of complementary
imaging information without the need for additional imaging sessions. Given the
practical challenges associated with acquiring paired MRI and CT scans, the
development of robust methods capable of leveraging unpaired datasets is
essential for advancing the MRI-to-CT translation. Current unpaired MRI-to-CT
translation methods, which predominantly rely on cycle consistency and
contrastive learning frameworks, frequently encounter challenges in accurately
translating anatomical features that are highly discernible on CT but less
distinguishable on MRI, such as bone structures. This limitation renders these
approaches less suitable for applications in radiation therapy, where precise
bone representation is essential for accurate treatment planning. To address
this challenge, we propose a path- and bone-contour regularized approach for
unpaired MRI-to-CT translation. In our method, MRI and CT images are projected
to a shared latent space, where the MRI-to-CT mapping is modeled as a
continuous flow governed by neural ordinary differential equations. The optimal
mapping is obtained by minimizing the transition path length of the flow. To
enhance the accuracy of translated bone structures, we introduce a trainable
neural network to generate bone contours from MRI and implement mechanisms to
directly and indirectly encourage the model to focus on bone contours and their
adjacent regions. Evaluations conducted on three datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing unpaired MRI-to-CT translation approaches,
achieving lower overall error rates. Moreover, in a downstream bone
segmentation task, our approach exhibits superior performance in preserving the
fidelity of bone structures. Our code is available at:

<p class='card-text'>For time-domain astronomy, it is crucial to frequently image celestial
objects at specific depths within a predetermined cadence. To fulfill these
scientific demands, scientists globally have started or planned the development
of non-interferometric telescope arrays in recent years. Due to the numerous
parameters involved in configuring these arrays, there is a need for an
automated optimization framework that selects parameter sets to satisfy
scientific needs while minimizing costs. In this paper, we introduce such a
framework, which integrates optical design software, an exposure time
calculator, and an optimization algorithm, to balance the observation
capabilities and the cost of optical telescope arrays. Neural networks are
utilized to speed up results retrieval of the system with different
configurations. We use the SiTian project as a case study to demonstrate the
framework's effectiveness, showing that this approach can aid scientists in

method addresses key challenges in visuomotor policy learning through a

while efficiently adapting to environmental changes. LAP employs Bayesian
updating in latent space to incrementally refine plans as new observations
become available, striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency

robots through model-based proportional mapping that regenerates accurate
kinematic-dynamic joint states and object positions from human demonstrations.
Experimental evaluations across multiple complex manipulation benchmarks
demonstrate that LAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
existing approaches in success rate, trajectory smoothness, and energy

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous long-horizon mobile manipulation encompasses a multitude of
challenges, including scene dynamics, unexplored areas, and error recovery.
Recent works have leveraged foundation models for scene-level robotic reasoning
and planning. However, the performance of these methods degrades when dealing
with a large number of objects and large-scale environments. To address these
limitations, we propose MORE, a novel approach for enhancing the capabilities
of language models to solve zero-shot mobile manipulation planning for
rearrangement tasks. MORE leverages scene graphs to represent environments,
incorporates instance differentiation, and introduces an active filtering
scheme that extracts task-relevant subgraphs of object and region instances.
These steps yield a bounded planning problem, effectively mitigating
hallucinations and improving reliability. Additionally, we introduce several
enhancements that enable planning across both indoor and outdoor environments.
We evaluate MORE on 81 diverse rearrangement tasks from the BEHAVIOR-1K
benchmark, where it becomes the first approach to successfully solve a
significant share of the benchmark, outperforming recent foundation model-based
approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of our approach in
several complex real-world tasks, mimicking everyday activities. We make the

<p class='card-text'>Bloom filters are used in query processing to perform early data reduction
and improve query performance. The optimal query plan may be different when
Bloom filters are used, indicating the need for Bloom filter-aware query
optimization. To date, Bloom filter-aware query optimization has only been
incorporated in a top-down query optimizer and limited to snowflake queries. In
this paper, we show how Bloom filters can be incorporated in a bottom-up
cost-based query optimizer. We highlight the challenges in limiting optimizer
search space expansion, and offer an efficient solution. We show that including
Bloom filters in cost-based optimization can lead to better join orders with
effective predicate transfer between operators. On a 100 GB instance of the
TPC-H database, our approach achieved a 32.8% further reduction in latency for
queries involving Bloom filters, compared to the traditional approach of adding
Bloom filters in a separate post-optimization step. Our method applies to all
query types, and we provide several heuristics to balance limited increases in
optimization time against improved query latency.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Understanding urban form is crucial for sustainable urban planning and
enhancing quality of life. This study presents a data-driven framework to
systematically identify and compare urban typologies across geographically and
culturally distinct cities. Using open-source geospatial data from
OpenStreetMap, we extracted multidimensional features related to topography,
multimodality, green spaces, and points of interest for the cities of Lausanne,
Switzerland, and Philadelphia, USA. A grid-based approach was used to divide
each city into Basic Spatial Units (BSU), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
were applied to cluster BSUs based on their urban characteristics. The results
reveal coherent and interpretable urban typologies within each city, with some
cluster types emerging across both cities despite their differences in scale,
density, and cultural context. Comparative analysis showed that adapting the
grid size to each city's morphology improves the detection of shared
typologies. Simplified clustering based solely on network degree centrality
further demonstrated that meaningful structural patterns can be captured even
with minimal feature sets. Our findings suggest the presence of functionally
convergent urban forms across continents and highlight the importance of
spatial scale in cross-city comparisons. The framework offers a scalable and
transferable approach for urban analysis, providing valuable insights for
planners and policymakers aiming to enhance walkability, accessibility, and
well-being. Limitations related to data completeness and feature selection are
discussed, and directions for future work -- including the integration of
additional data sources and human-centered validation -- are proposed.</p>
