<p class='card-text'>The increasing complexity of underwater robotic systems has led to a surge in
simulation platforms designed to support perception, planning, and control
tasks in marine environments. However, selecting the most appropriate
underwater robotic simulator (URS) remains a challenge due to wide variations
in fidelity, extensibility, and task suitability. This paper presents a
comprehensive review and comparative analysis of five state-of-the-art,
ROS-compatible, open-source URSs: Stonefish, DAVE, HoloOcean, MARUS, and
UNav-Sim. Each simulator is evaluated across multiple criteria including sensor
fidelity, environmental realism, sim-to-real capabilities, and research impact.
We evaluate them across architectural design, sensor and physics modeling, task
capabilities, and research impact. Additionally, we discuss ongoing challenges
in sim-to-real transfer and highlight the need for standardization and
benchmarking in the field. Our findings aim to guide practitioners in selecting
effective simulation environments and inform future development of more robust
and transferable URSs.</p>

  Autonomous Mobile Robots</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Adrian Szvoren, Jianwei Liu, Dimitrios Kanoulas, Nilufer Tuptuk</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-08 15:48:26</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Path planning algorithms, such as the search-based A*, are a critical
component of autonomous mobile robotics, enabling robots to navigate from a
starting point to a destination efficiently and safely. We investigated the
resilience of the A* algorithm in the face of potential adversarial
interventions known as obstacle attacks. The adversary's goal is to delay the
robot's timely arrival at its destination by introducing obstacles along its
original path.
  We developed malicious software to execute the attacks and conducted
experiments to assess their impact, both in simulation using TurtleBot in
Gazebo and in real-world deployment with the Unitree Go1 robot. In simulation,
the attacks resulted in an average delay of 36\%, with the most significant
delays occurring in scenarios where the robot was forced to take substantially
longer alternative paths. In real-world experiments, the delays were even more
pronounced, with all attacks successfully rerouting the robot and causing
measurable disruptions. These results highlight that the algorithm's robustness
is not solely an attribute of its design but is significantly influenced by the
operational environment. For example, in constrained environments like tunnels,
the delays were maximized due to the limited availability of alternative
routes.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Bauplan is a FaaS-based lakehouse specifically built for data pipelines: its
execution engine uses Apache Arrow for data passing between the nodes in the

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have led to
significant improvements across various multimodal benchmarks. However, as
evaluations shift from static datasets to open-world, dynamic environments,
current game-based benchmarks remain inadequate because they lack
visual-centric tasks and fail to assess the diverse reasoning skills required
for real-world decision-making. To address this, we introduce Visual-centric
Multiple Abilities Game Evaluation (V-MAGE), a game-based evaluation framework
designed to assess visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. V-MAGE features five
diverse games with 30+ handcrafted levels, testing models on core visual skills
such as positioning, trajectory tracking, timing, and visual memory, alongside
higher-level reasoning like long-term planning and deliberation. We use V-MAGE
to evaluate leading MLLMs, revealing significant challenges in their visual
perception and reasoning. In all game environments, the top-performing MLLMs,
as determined by Elo rating comparisons, exhibit a substantial performance gap
compared to humans. Our findings highlight critical limitations, including
various types of perceptual errors made by the models, and suggest potential
avenues for improvement from an agent-centric perspective, such as refining
agent strategies and addressing perceptual inaccuracies. Code is available at

<p class='card-text'>Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) are an extension of the Traveling Salesperson
Problem and are a fundamental NP-hard challenge in combinatorial optimization.
Solving VRP in real-time at large scale has become critical in numerous
applications, from growing markets like last-mile delivery to emerging
use-cases like interactive logistics planning. Such applications involve
solving similar problem instances repeatedly, yet current state-of-the-art
solvers treat each instance on its own without leveraging previous examples. We
introduce a novel optimization framework that uses a reinforcement learning
agent - trained on prior instances - to quickly generate initial solutions,
which are then further optimized by genetic algorithms. Our framework,
Evolutionary Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning Initialization (EARLI),
consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art solvers across various time
scales. For example, EARLI handles vehicle routing with 500 locations within
1s, 10x faster than current solvers for the same solution quality, enabling
applications like real-time and interactive routing. EARLI can generalize to
new data, as demonstrated on real e-commerce delivery data of a previously
unseen city. Our hybrid framework presents a new way to combine reinforcement
learning and genetic algorithms, paving the road for closer interdisciplinary
collaboration between AI and optimization communities towards real-time
optimization in diverse domains.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Safety is critical during human-robot interaction. But -- because people are
inherently unpredictable -- it is often difficult for robots to plan safe
behaviors. Instead of relying on our ability to anticipate humans, here we
identify robot policies that are robust to unexpected human decisions. We
achieve this by formulating human-robot interaction as a zero-sum game, where
(in the worst case) the human's actions directly conflict with the robot's
objective. Solving for the Nash Equilibrium of this game provides robot
policies that maximize safety and performance across a wide range of human
actions. Existing approaches attempt to find these optimal policies by
leveraging Hamilton-Jacobi analysis (which is intractable) or linear-quadratic
approximations (which are inexact). By contrast, in this work we propose a
computationally efficient and theoretically justified method that converges
towards the Nash Equilibrium policy. Our approach (which we call MCLQ)
leverages linear-quadratic games to obtain an initial guess at safe robot
behavior, and then iteratively refines that guess with a Monte Carlo search.
Not only does MCLQ provide real-time safety adjustments, but it also enables
the designer to tune how conservative the robot is -- preventing the system
from focusing on unrealistic human behaviors. Our simulations and user study
suggest that this approach advances safety in terms of both computation time
and expected performance. See videos of our experiments here:

<p class='card-text'>The vast majority of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) methods with
completeness guarantees require planning full horizon paths. However, planning
full horizon paths can take too long and be impractical in real-world
applications. Instead, real-time planning and execution, which only allows the
planner a finite amount of time before executing and replanning, is more
practical for real world multi-agent systems. Several methods utilize real-time
planning schemes but none are provably complete, which leads to livelock or
deadlock. Our main contribution is to show the first Real-Time MAPF method with
provable completeness guarantees. We do this by leveraging LaCAM (Okumura 2023)
in an incremental fashion. Our results show how we can iteratively plan for
congested environments with a cutoff time of milliseconds while still
maintaining the same success rate as full horizon LaCAM. We also show how it
can be used with a single-step learned MAPF policy. The proposed Real-Time
LaCAM also provides us with a general mechanism for using iterative constraints
for completeness in future real-time MAPF algorithms.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) has driven many recent breakthroughs in deep
reinforcement learning (RL). However, scaling MCTS to parallel compute has
proven challenging in practice which has motivated alternative planners like
sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC). Many of these SMC methods adopt particle filters
for smoothing through a reformulation of RL as a policy inference problem. Yet,
persisting design choices of these particle filters often conflict with the aim
of online planning in RL, which is to obtain a policy improvement at the start
of planning. Drawing inspiration from MCTS, we tailor SMC planners specifically
for RL by improving data generation within the planner through constrained
action sampling and explicit terminal state handling, as well as improving
policy and value target estimation. This leads to our Trust-Region Twisted SMC
(TRT-SMC), which shows improved runtime and sample-efficiency over baseline
MCTS and SMC methods in both discrete and continuous domains.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-08 12:24:37</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Automatic view positioning is crucial for cardiac computed tomography (CT)
examinations, including disease diagnosis and surgical planning. However, it is
highly challenging due to individual variability and large 3D search space.
Existing work needs labor-intensive and time-consuming manual annotations to
train view-specific models, which are limited to predicting only a fixed set of
planes. However, in real clinical scenarios, the challenge of positioning
semantic 2D slices with any orientation into varying coordinate space in
arbitrary 3D volume remains unsolved. We thus introduce a novel framework,
AVP-AP, the first to use Atlas Prompting for self-supervised Automatic View
Positioning in the 3D CT volume. Specifically, this paper first proposes an
atlas prompting method, which generates a 3D canonical atlas and trains a
network to map slices into their corresponding positions in the atlas space via
a self-supervised manner. Then, guided by atlas prompts corresponding to the
given query images in a reference CT, we identify the coarse positions of
slices in the target CT volume using rigid transformation between the 3D atlas
and target CT volume, effectively reducing the search space. Finally, we refine
the coarse positions by maximizing the similarity between the predicted slices
and the query images in the feature space of a given foundation model. Our
framework is flexible and efficient compared to other methods, outperforming
other methods by 19.8% average structural similarity (SSIM) in arbitrary view
positioning and achieving 9% SSIM in two-chamber view compared to four
radiologists. Meanwhile, experiments on a public dataset validate our
framework's generalizability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Effective demand forecasting is critical for inventory management, production
planning, and decision making across industries. Selecting the appropriate
model and suitable features to efficiently capture patterns in the data is one
of the main challenges in demand forecasting. In reality, this becomes even
more complicated when the recorded sales have zeroes, which can happen
naturally or due to some anomalies, such as stockouts and recording errors.
Mistreating the zeroes can lead to the application of inappropriate forecasting
methods, and thus leading to poor decision making. Furthermore, the demand
itself can have different fundamental characteristics, and being able to
distinguish one type from another might bring substantial benefits in terms of
accuracy and thus decision making. We propose a two-stage model-based
classification framework that in the first step, identifies artificially
occurring zeroes, and then classifies demand to one of the possible types:
regular/intermittent, intermittent smooth/lumpy, fractional/count. The
framework utilises statistical modelling and information criteria to detect
anomalous zeroes and then classify demand into those categories. We then argue
that different types of demand need different features, and show empirically
that they tend to increase the accuracy of the forecasting methods compared to
those applied directly to the dataset without the generated features and the
two-stage framework. Our general practical recommendation based on that is to
use the mixture approach for intermittent demand, capturing the demand sizes
and demand probability separately, as it seems to improve the accuracy of
different forecasting approaches.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This study presents residual U-Net (U-ResNet), a deep learning surrogate
model for predicting hemodynamic fields in two-dimensional asymmetric stenotic
channels at Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 800. By integrating residual

accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Comprehensive evaluation against
U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural
Operator demonstrates U-ResNet's superior performance in capturing sharp
hemodynamic gradients and complex flow features. Notably, U-ResNet demonstrates
robust generalization to interpolated Reynolds numbers without retraining - a
capability rarely achieved in existing models. The model's non-dimensional

enhancing its applicability to diverse clinical scenarios. Statistical analysis
of prediction errors reveals that U-ResNet maintains substantially narrower

generation of comfortable, socially aware trajectories. To address these
issues, we propose SAP-CoPE, a social-aware planning framework that integrates
cooperative infrastructure with a novel 3D human pose estimation method and a
model predictive control-based controller. This real-time framework formulates
an optimization problem that accounts for uncertainty propagation in the camera
projection matrix while ensuring human joint coherence. The proposed method is
adaptable to single- or multi-camera configurations and can incorporate sparse
LiDAR point-cloud data. To enhance safety and comfort in human environments, we
integrate a human personal space field based on human pose into a model
predictive controller, enabling the system to navigate while avoiding
discomfort zones. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world
settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating socially
aware trajectories for autonomous systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing global health concern,
necessitating precise and efficient image analysis to aid diagnosis and
treatment planning. Automated segmentation of kidney pathology images plays a
central role in facilitating clinical workflows, yet conventional segmentation
models often require delicate threshold tuning. This paper proposes a novel
\textit{Cascaded Threshold-Integrated U-Net (CTI-Unet)} to overcome the
limitations of single-threshold segmentation. By sequentially integrating
multiple thresholded outputs, our approach can reconcile noise suppression with
the preservation of finer structural details. Experiments on the challenging
KPIs2024 dataset demonstrate that CTI-Unet outperforms state-of-the-art
architectures such as nnU-Net, Swin-Unet, and CE-Net, offering a robust and
flexible framework for kidney pathology image segmentation.</p>

  Operational On-Demand Fulfillment via Reinforcement Learning with Information
  Shaping</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Xinwei Chen, Marlin W. Ulmer, Barrett W. Thomas</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-08 03:25:37</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The last few years have witnessed rapid growth in the on-demand delivery
market, with many start-ups entering the field. However, not all of these
start-ups have succeeded due to various reasons, among others, not being able
to establish a large enough customer base. In this paper, we address this
problem that many on-demand transportation start-ups face: how to establish
themselves in a new market. When starting, such companies often have limited
fleet resources to serve demand across a city. Depending on the use of the
fleet, varying service quality is observed in different areas of the city, and
in turn, the service quality impacts the respective growth of demand in each
area. Thus, operational fulfillment decisions drive the longer-term demand
development. To integrate strategic demand development into real-time
fulfillment operations, we propose a two-step approach. First, we derive
analytical insights into optimal allocation decisions for a stylized problem.
Second, we use these insights to shape the training data of a reinforcement
learning strategy for operational real-time fulfillment. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining operational efficiency with long-term strategic
planning is highly advantageous. Further, we show that the careful shaping of
training data is essential for the successful development of demand.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-07 23:01:50</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We introduce Lazy-DaSH, an improvement over the recent state of the art
multi-robot task and motion planning method DaSH, which scales to more than
double the number of robots and objects compared to the original method and
achieves an order of magnitude faster planning time when applied to a
multi-manipulator object rearrangement problem. We achieve this improvement
through a hierarchical approach, where a high-level task planning layer
identifies planning spaces required for task completion, and motion feasibility
is validated lazily only within these spaces. In contrast, DaSH precomputes the
motion feasibility of all possible actions, resulting in higher costs for
constructing state space representations. Lazy-DaSH maintains efficient query
performance by utilizing a constraint feedback mechanism within its
hierarchical structure, ensuring that motion feasibility is effectively
conveyed to the query process. By maintaining smaller state space
representations, our method significantly reduces both representation
construction time and query time. We evaluate Lazy-DaSH in four distinct
scenarios, demonstrating its scalability to increasing numbers of robots and
objects, as well as its adaptability in resolving conflicts through the
constraint feedback mechanism.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-07 23:00:31</h6>
<p class='card-text'>One approach to using prior experience in robot motion planning is to store
solutions to previously seen problems in a database of paths. Methods that use
such databases are characterized by how they query for a path and how they use
queries given a new problem. In this work we present a new method, Path
Database Guidance (PDG), which innovates on existing work in two ways. First,
we use the database to compute a heuristic for determining which nodes of a
search tree to expand, in contrast to prior work which generally pastes the
(possibly transformed) queried path or uses it to bias a sampling distribution.
We demonstrate that this makes our method more easily composable with other
search methods by dynamically interleaving exploration according to a baseline
algorithm with exploitation of the database guidance. Second, in contrast to
other methods that treat the database as a single fixed prior, our database
(and thus our queried heuristic) updates as we search the implicitly defined
robot configuration space. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of
PDG in a variety of explicitly defined environment distributions in simulation.</p>

the Ethereum ecosystem, driving the development of automated tools for
detection and mitigation. Smart contracts are written in Solidity, a
programming language that is rapidly evolving to add features and improvements
to enhance smart contract security. New versions of Solidity change the
compilation process, potentially affecting how tools interpret and analyze
smart contract code. Objective: In such a continuously evolving landscape, we
aim to investigate the compatibility of detection tools with Solidity versions.
More specifically, we present a plan to study detection tools by empirically
assessing (i) their compatibility with the Solidity pragma directives, (ii)
their detection effectiveness, and (iii) their execution time across different

<p class='card-text'>Zero Trust is the new cybersecurity model that challenges the traditional one
by promoting continuous verification of users, devices, and applications,
whatever their position or origin. This model is critical for reducing the
attack surface and preventing lateral movement without relying on implicit
trust. Adopting the zero trust principle in Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS), especially in the context of connected vehicles (CVs), presents an
adequate solution in the face of increasing cyber threats, thereby
strengthening the ITS environment. This paper offers an understanding of Zero
Trust security through a comprehensive review of existing literature,
principles, and challenges. It specifically examines its applications in
emerging technologies, particularly within connected vehicles, addressing
potential issues and cyber threats faced by CVs. Inclusion/exclusion criteria
for the systematic literature review were planned alongside a bibliometric
analysis. Moreover, keyword co-occurrence analysis was done, which indicates
trends and general themes for the Zero Trust model, Zero Trust implementation,
and Zero Trust application. Furthermore, the paper explores various ZT models
proposed in the literature for connected vehicles, shedding light on the
challenges associated with their integration into CV systems. Future directions
of this research will focus on incorporating Zero Trust principles within
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication
paradigms. This initiative intends to enhance the security posture and safety
protocols within interconnected vehicular networks. The proposed research seeks
to address the unique cybersecurity vulnerabilities inherent in the highly

<p class='card-text'>As generative AI (GenAI) models are increasingly explored for educational
applications, understanding educator preferences for AI-generated lesson plans
is critical for their effective integration into K-12 instruction. This
exploratory study compares lesson plans authored by human curriculum designers,
a fine-tuned LLaMA-2-13b model trained on K-12 content, and a customized GPT-4
model to evaluate their pedagogical quality across multiple instructional
measures: warm-up activities, main tasks, cool-down activities, and overall
quality. Using a large-scale preference study with K-12 math educators, we
examine how preferences vary across grade levels and instructional components.
We employ both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The raw preference
results indicate that human-authored lesson plans are generally favored,
particularly for elementary education, where educators emphasize student
engagement, scaffolding, and collaborative learning. However, AI-generated
models demonstrate increasing competitiveness in cool-down tasks and structured
learning activities, particularly in high school settings. Beyond quantitative
results, we conduct thematic analysis using LDA and manual coding to identify
key factors influencing educator preferences. Educators value human-authored
plans for their nuanced differentiation, real-world contextualization, and
student discourse facilitation. Meanwhile, AI-generated lesson plans are often
praised for their structure and adaptability for specific instructional tasks.
Findings suggest a human-AI collaborative approach to lesson planning, where
GenAI can serve as an assistive tool rather than a replacement for educator
expertise in lesson planning. This study contributes to the growing discourse
on responsible AI integration in education, highlighting both opportunities and
challenges in leveraging GenAI for curriculum development.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a widely adopted control paradigm that
leverages predictive models to estimate future system states and optimize
control inputs accordingly. However, while MPC excels in planning and control,
it lacks the capability for environmental perception, leading to failures in
complex and unstructured scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce
Vision-Language Model Predictive Control (VLMPC), a robotic manipulation
planning framework that integrates the perception power of vision-language
models (VLMs) with MPC. VLMPC utilizes a conditional action sampling module
that takes a goal image or language instruction as input and leverages VLM to
generate candidate action sequences. These candidates are fed into a video
prediction model that simulates future frames based on the actions. In
addition, we propose an enhanced variant, Traj-VLMPC, which replaces video
prediction with motion trajectory generation to reduce computational complexity
while maintaining accuracy. Traj-VLMPC estimates motion dynamics conditioned on
the candidate actions, offering a more efficient alternative for long-horizon
tasks and real-time applications. Both VLMPC and Traj-VLMPC select the optimal
action sequence using a VLM-based hierarchical cost function that captures both
pixel-level and knowledge-level consistency between the current observation and
the task input. We demonstrate that both approaches outperform existing
state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks and achieve excellent performance
in various real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Code is available at

<p class='card-text'>Existing language models (LMs) often exhibit a Western-centric bias and
struggle to represent diverse cultural knowledge. Previous attempts to address
this rely on synthetic data and express cultural knowledge only in English. In
this work, we study whether a small amount of human-written, multilingual
cultural preference data can improve LMs across various model families and
sizes. We first introduce CARE, a multilingual resource of 24.1k responses with
human preferences on 2,580 questions about Chinese and Arab cultures, all
carefully annotated by native speakers and offering more balanced coverage.
Using CARE, we demonstrate that cultural alignment improves existing LMs beyond
generic resources without compromising general capabilities. Moreover, we
evaluate the cultural awareness of LMs, native speakers, and retrieved web
content when queried in different languages. Our experiment reveals regional
disparities among LMs, which may also be reflected in the documentation gap:
native speakers often take everyday cultural commonsense and social norms for
granted, while non-natives are more likely to actively seek out and document
them. CARE is publicly available at https://github.com/Guochry/CARE (we plan to
add Japanese data in the near future).</p>

<p class='card-text'>The proliferation of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has positioned
mixed traffic environments, which encompass both CAVs and human driven vehicles
(HDVs), as critical components of emerging mobility systems. Signalized
intersections are paramount for optimizing transportation efficiency and
enhancing energy economy, as they inherently induce stop and go traffic
dynamics. In this paper, we present an integrated framework that concurrently
optimizes signal timing and CAV trajectories at signalized intersections, with
the dual objectives of maximizing traffic throughput and minimizing energy
consumption for CAVs. We first formulate an optimal control strategy for CAVs
that prioritizes trajectory planning to circumvent state constraints, while
incorporating the impact of signal timing and HDV behavior. Furthermore, we
introduce a traffic signal control methodology that dynamically adjusts signal
phases based on vehicular density per lane, while mitigating disruption for
CAVs scheduled to traverse the intersection. Acknowledging the system's
inherent dynamism, we also explore event triggered replanning mechanisms that
enable CAVs to iteratively refine their planned trajectories in response to the
emergence of more efficient routing options. The efficacy of our proposed
framework is evaluated through comprehensive simulations in MATLAB.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cloth manipulation is a difficult problem mainly because of the non-rigid
nature of cloth, which makes a good representation of deformation essential. We
present a new representation for the deformation-state of clothes. First, we
propose the dGLI disk representation, based on topological indices computed for
segments on the edges of the cloth mesh border that are arranged on a circular
grid. The heat-map of the dGLI disk uncovers patterns that correspond to
features of the cloth state that are consistent for different shapes, sizes of
positions of the cloth, like the corners and the fold locations. We then
abstract these important features from the dGLI disk onto a circle, calling it
the Cloth StatE representation (CloSE). This representation is compact,
continuous, and general for different shapes. Finally, we show the strengths of
this representation in two relevant applications: semantic labeling and high-

<p class='card-text'>Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP) is a widely used framework for
generating smooth trajectories within a limited compute time--an essential
requirement in many robotic applications. However, traditional GPMP approaches
often struggle with enforcing hard nonlinear constraints and rely on Maximum a
Posteriori (MAP) solutions that disregard the full Bayesian posterior. This
limits planning diversity and ultimately hampers decision-making. Recent
efforts to integrate Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) into motion
planning have shown promise in handling complex constraints. Nonetheless, these
methods still face persistent challenges, such as difficulties in strictly
enforcing constraints and inefficiencies when the probabilistic inference
problem is poorly conditioned. To address these issues, we propose a novel
constrained Stein Variational Gaussian Process Motion Planning (cSGPMP)
framework, incorporating a GPMP prior specifically designed for trajectory
optimization under hard constraints. Our approach improves the efficiency of
particle-based inference while explicitly handling nonlinear constraints. This
advancement significantly broadens the applicability of GPMP to motion planning
scenarios demanding robust Bayesian inference, strict constraint adherence, and
computational efficiency within a limited time. We validate our method on
standard benchmarks, achieving an average success rate of 98.57% across 350
planning tasks, significantly outperforming competitive baselines. This
demonstrates the ability of our method to discover and use diverse trajectory
modes, enhancing flexibility and adaptability in complex environments, and
delivering significant improvements over standard baselines without incurring
major computational costs.</p>
