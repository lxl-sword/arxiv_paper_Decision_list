<p class='card-text'>Continual learning in robotics seeks systems that can constantly adapt to
changing environments and tasks, mirroring human adaptability. A key challenge
is refining dynamics models, essential for planning and control, while
addressing issues such as safe adaptation, catastrophic forgetting, outlier
management, data efficiency, and balancing exploration with exploitation -- all
within task and onboard resource constraints. Towards this goal, we introduce a
generative framework leveraging flow matching for online robot dynamics model
alignment. Rather than executing actions based on a misaligned model, our
approach refines planned actions to better match with those the robot would
take if its model was well aligned. We find that by transforming the actions
themselves rather than exploring with a misaligned model -- as is traditionally
done -- the robot collects informative data more efficiently, thereby
accelerating learning. Moreover, we validate that the method can handle an
evolving and possibly imperfect model while reducing, if desired, the
dependency on replay buffers or legacy model snapshots. We validate our
approach using two platforms: an unmanned ground vehicle and a quadrotor. The
results highlight the method's adaptability and efficiency, with a record
34.2\% higher task success rate, demonstrating its potential towards enabling
continual robot learning. Code:

<p class='card-text'>Bias is an inherent threat to human decision-making, including in decisions
made during software development. Extensive research has demonstrated the
presence of biases at various stages of the software development life-cycle.
Notably, code reviews are highly susceptible to prejudice-induced biases, and
individuals are often unaware of these biases as they occur. Developing methods
to automatically detect these biases is crucial for addressing the associated
challenges. Recent advancements in visual data analytics have shown promising
results in detecting potential biases by analyzing user interaction patterns.
In this project, we propose a controlled experiment to extend this approach to
detect potentially biased outcomes in code reviews by observing how reviewers
interact with the code. We employ the "spotlight model of attention", a
cognitive framework where a reviewer's gaze is tracked to determine their focus
areas on the review screen. This focus, identified through gaze tracking,
serves as an indicator of the reviewer's areas of interest or concern. We plan
to analyze the sequence of gaze focus using advanced sequence modeling
techniques, including Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and
Conditional Random Fields (CRF). These techniques will help us identify
patterns that may suggest biased interactions. We anticipate that the ability
to automatically detect potentially biased interactions in code reviews will
significantly reduce unnecessary push-backs, enhance operational efficiency,
and foster greater diversity and inclusion in software development. This
approach not only helps in identifying biases but also in creating a more
equitable development environment by mitigating these biases effectively</p>

<p class='card-text'>In the trajectory planning of automated driving, data-driven statistical
artificial intelligence (AI) methods are increasingly established for
predicting the emergent behavior of other road users. While these methods
achieve exceptional performance in defined datasets, they usually rely on the
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption and thus tend to be
vulnerable to distribution shifts that occur in the real world. In addition,
these methods lack explainability due to their black box nature, which poses
further challenges in terms of the approval process and social trustworthiness.
Therefore, in order to use the capabilities of data-driven statistical AI
methods in a reliable and trustworthy manner, the concept of TrustMHE is
introduced and investigated in this paper. TrustMHE represents a complementary
approach, independent of the underlying AI systems, that combines AI-driven
out-of-distribution detection with control-driven moving horizon estimation
(MHE) to enable not only detection and monitoring, but also intervention. The
effectiveness of the proposed TrustMHE is evaluated and proven in three
simulation scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Shared autonomy allows for combining the global planning capabilities of a
human operator with the strengths of a robot such as repeatability and accurate
control. In a real-time teleoperation setting, one possibility for shared
autonomy is to let the human operator decide for the rough movement and to let
the robot do fine adjustments, e.g., when the view of the operator is occluded.
We present a learning-based concept for shared autonomy that aims at supporting
the human operator in a real-time teleoperation setting. At every step, our
system tracks the target pose set by the human operator as accurately as
possible while at the same time satisfying a set of constraints which influence
the robot's behavior. An important characteristic is that the constraints can
be dynamically activated and deactivated which allows the system to provide
task-specific assistance. Since the system must generate robot commands in
real-time, solving an optimization problem in every iteration is not feasible.
Instead, we sample potential target configurations and use Neural Networks for
predicting the constraint costs for each configuration. By evaluating each
configuration in parallel, our system is able to select the target
configuration which satisfies the constraints and has the minimum distance to
the operator's target pose with minimal delay. We evaluate the framework with a
pick and place task on a bi-manual setup with two Franka Emika Panda robot arms
with Robotiq grippers.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly utilized in search

enhancements in automation, avionics, and the reduced cost of electronics. In
this work, we introduce a collaborative model predictive control (MPC)
framework aimed at addressing the joint problem of guidance and state
estimation for tracking multiple castaway targets with a fleet of autonomous
UAV agents. We assume that each UAV agent is equipped with a camera sensor,
which has a limited sensing range and is utilized for receiving noisy
observations from multiple moving castaways adrift in maritime conditions. We
derive a nonlinear mixed integer programming (NMIP) -based controller that
facilitates the guidance of the UAVs by generating non-myopic trajectories
within a receding planning horizon. These trajectories are designed to minimize
the tracking error across multiple targets by directing the UAV fleet to
locations expected to yield targets measurements, thereby minimizing the
uncertainty of the estimated target states. Extensive simulation experiments
validate the effectiveness of our proposed method in tracking multiple

<p class='card-text'>Navigating autonomous vehicles in open scenarios is a challenge due to the
difficulties in handling unseen objects. Existing solutions either rely on
small models that struggle with generalization or large models that are
resource-intensive. While collaboration between the two offers a promising
solution, the key challenge is deciding when and how to engage the large model.
To address this issue, this paper proposes opportunistic collaborative planning
(OCP), which seamlessly integrates efficient local models with powerful cloud
models through two key innovations. First, we propose large vision model guided
model predictive control (LVM-MPC), which leverages the cloud for LVM
perception and decision making. The cloud output serves as a global guidance
for a local MPC, thereby forming a closed-loop perception-to-control system.
Second, to determine the best timing for large model query and service, we
propose collaboration timing optimization (CTO), including object detection
confidence thresholding (ODCT) and cloud forward simulation (CFS), to decide
when to seek cloud assistance and when to offer cloud service. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed OCP outperforms existing methods in terms of
both navigation time and success rate.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, pivotal to Advanced
Air Mobility (AAM), are emerging as a transformative transportation paradigm
with the potential to redefine urban and regional mobility. While these systems
offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely
heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time
navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating
robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves
offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight
path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum
conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to
maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer
promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit
for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying
nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which
leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates,
excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these
challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms
that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy
consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with
primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed
Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte

selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and

<p class='card-text'>Efficient trajectory generation is critical for autonomous systems, yet
current numerical methods often struggle to handle periodic behaviors
effectively, especially when equidistant time nodes are required. This paper
introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored
explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the
uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic
behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series.
Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for
approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed
error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach
for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and
practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish
feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous
counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing
theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying
the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle.
Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance,
demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and
precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our
mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically
grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal

<p class='card-text'>Gait disorders are commonly observed in older adults, who frequently
experience various issues related to walking. Additionally, researchers and
clinicians extensively investigate mobility related to gait in typically and
atypically developing children, athletes, and individuals with orthopedic and
neurological disorders. Effective gait analysis enables the understanding of
the causal mechanisms of mobility and balance control of patients, the
development of tailored treatment plans to improve mobility, the reduction of
fall risk, and the tracking of rehabilitation progress. However, analyzing gait
data is a complex task due to the multivariate nature of the data, the large
volume of information to be interpreted, and the technical skills required.
Existing tools for gait analysis are often limited to specific patient groups
(e.g., cerebral palsy), only handle a specific subset of tasks in the entire
workflow, and are not openly accessible. To address these shortcomings, we
conducted a requirements assessment with gait practitioners (e.g., researchers,
clinicians) via surveys and identified key components of the workflow,
including (1) data processing and (2) data analysis and visualization. Based on
the findings, we designed VIGMA, an open-access visual analytics framework

approach this problem by learning the constituent models of a
Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where the robot can
observe the outcome of a push, but the physical properties of the block that
govern the dynamics remain unknown. The pushing problem is a difficult POMDP to
solve due to the challenge of state estimation. The physical properties have a
nonlinear relationship with the outcomes, requiring computationally expensive
methods, such as particle filters, to represent beliefs. Leveraging the
Attentive Neural Process architecture, we propose to replace the particle
filter with a neural network that learns the inference computation over the
physical properties given a history of actions. This Neural Process is

<p class='card-text'>To safely traverse non-flat terrain, robots must account for the influence of
terrain shape in their planned motions. Terrain-aware motion planners use an
estimate of the vehicle roll and pitch as a function of pose, vehicle
suspension, and ground elevation map to weigh the cost of edges in the search
space. Encoding such information in a traditional two-dimensional cost map is
limiting because it is unable to capture the influence of orientation on the
roll and pitch estimates from sloped terrain. The research presented herein
addresses this problem by encoding kinodynamic information in the edges of a
recombinant motion planning search space based on the Efficiently Adaptive
State Lattice (EASL). This approach, which we describe as a Kinodynamic
Efficiently Adaptive State Lattice (KEASL), differs from the prior
representation in two ways. First, this method uses a novel encoding of
velocity and acceleration constraints and vehicle direction at expanded nodes
in the motion planning graph. Second, this approach describes additional steps
for evaluating the roll, pitch, constraints, and velocities associated with
poses along each edge during search in a manner that still enables the graph to
remain recombinant. Velocities are computed using an iterative bidirectional
method using Eulerian integration that more accurately estimates the duration
of edges that are subject to terrain-dependent velocity limits. Real-world
experiments on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog Unmanned Ground Vehicle were
performed in a non-flat, unstructured environment. Results from 2093 planning
queries from these experiments showed that KEASL provided a more efficient
route than EASL in 83.72% of cases when EASL plans were adjusted to satisfy
terrain-dependent velocity constraints. An analysis of relative runtimes and

an optimal path given the robot's current position. To control the high-level
operation, a finite state machine is used to switch between two modes:
navigating towards a POI using Nav2, and scanning the local surrounding. We

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Bernhard Jaeger, Daniel Dauner, Jens Beißwenger, Simon Gerstenecker, Kashyap Chitta, Andreas Geiger</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-24 17:56:01</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We investigate reinforcement learning (RL) for privileged planning in
autonomous driving. State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based,
but these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is
scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning.
Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum
multiple individual rewards, \eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We
show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the
mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches.
Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single
intuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by
terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion. We find
that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple
reward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes
enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to
300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The
resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark,
outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin.
Requiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is
the best learning-based approach on nuPlan. It scores 91.3 in non-reactive and
90.6 in reactive traffic on the Val14 benchmark while being an order of
magnitude faster than prior work.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Online experiments using metaverse platforms have gained significant traction
in Human-Computer Interaction and Virtual Reality (VR) research. However,
current research workflows are highly fragmented, as researchers must use
separate tools for system implementation, participant recruitment, experiment
execution, and data collection, reducing consistency and increasing workload.
We present LUIDA (Large-scale Unified Infrastructure for Digital Assessments),
a metaverse-based framework that integrates these fragmented processes. LUIDA
automatically allocates interconnected virtual environments for parallel
experiment execution and provides implementation templates adaptable to various
VR research domains, requiring minimal metaverse development expertise. Our
evaluation included two studies using a prototype built on Cluster, the
commercial metaverse platform. First, VR researchers using LUIDA to develop and
run experiments reported high usability scores (SUS: 73.75) and moderate
workload (NASA-TLX: 24.11) for overall usage, with interviews confirming
streamlined workflows compared to traditional laboratory experiments. Second,
we conducted three replicated experiments with public Cluster users, each
recruiting approximately 200 participants within one week. These experiments
produced results that closely matched the original studies, validating the
experimental integrity of LUIDA across research domains. After technical
refinements, we plan to release LUIDA as an open platform, providing a
standardized protocol to improve research efficiency and experimental
reproducibility in VR studies.</p>

  Correction in Construction Monitoring</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Asier Bikandi, Muhammad Shaheer, Hriday Bavle, Jayan Jevanesan, Holger Voos, Jose Luis Sanchez-Lopez</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-24 16:02:02</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Augmented reality (AR) applications for construction monitoring rely on
real-time environmental tracking to visualize architectural elements. However,
construction sites present significant challenges for traditional tracking
methods due to featureless surfaces, dynamic changes, and drift accumulation,
leading to misalignment between digital models and the physical world. This
paper proposes a BIM-aware drift correction method to address these challenges.
Instead of relying solely on SLAM-based localization, we align ``as-built"
detected planes from the real-world environment with ``as-planned"
architectural planes in BIM. Our method performs robust plane matching and
computes a transformation (TF) between SLAM (S) and BIM (B) origin frames using
optimization techniques, minimizing drift over time. By incorporating BIM as
prior structural knowledge, we can achieve improved long-term localization and
enhanced AR visualization accuracy in noisy construction environments. The
method is evaluated through real-world experiments, showing significant
reductions in drift-induced errors and optimized alignment consistency. On
average, our system achieves a reduction of 52.24% in angular deviations and a
reduction of 60.8% in the distance error of the matched walls compared to the
initial manual alignment by the user.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Navigating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) through cluttered and dynamic
environments remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with
fast-moving or sudden-appearing obstacles. This paper introduces a complete
LiDAR-based system designed to enable UAVs to avoid various moving obstacles in
complex environments. Benefiting the high computational efficiency of
perception and planning, the system can operate in real time using onboard
computing resources with low latency. For dynamic environment perception, we
have integrated our previous work, M-detector, into the system. M-detector
ensures that moving objects of different sizes, colors, and types are reliably
detected. For dynamic environment planning, we incorporate dynamic object
predictions into the integrated planning and control (IPC) framework, namely
DynIPC. This integration allows the UAV to utilize predictions about dynamic
obstacles to effectively evade them. We validate our proposed system through
both simulations and real-world experiments. In simulation tests, our system
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across several metrics, including
success rate, time consumption, average flight time, and maximum velocity. In
real-world trials, our system successfully navigates through forests, avoiding
moving obstacles along its path.</p>

  Clustering and a Geographical Prior</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-24 13:41:27</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Urban land use classification and mapping are critical for urban planning,
resource management, and environmental monitoring. Existing remote sensing
techniques often lack precision in complex urban environments due to the
absence of ground-level details. Unlike aerial perspectives, street view images
provide a ground-level view that captures more human and social activities
relevant to land use in complex urban scenes. Existing street view-based
methods primarily rely on supervised classification, which is challenged by the
scarcity of high-quality labeled data and the difficulty of generalizing across
diverse urban landscapes. This study introduces an unsupervised contrastive
clustering model for street view images with a built-in geographical prior, to
enhance clustering performance. When combined with a simple visual assignment
of the clusters, our approach offers a flexible and customizable solution to
land use mapping, tailored to the specific needs of urban planners. We
experimentally show that our method can generate land use maps from geotagged
street view image datasets of two cities. As our methodology relies on the
universal spatial coherence of geospatial data ("Tobler's law"), it can be
adapted to various settings where street view images are available, to enable
scalable, unsupervised land use mapping and updating. The code will be

<p class='card-text'>On-demand feeder bus services present an innovative solution to urban
mobility challenges, yet their success depends on thorough assessment and
strategic planning. Despite their potential, a comprehensive framework for
evaluating feasibility and identifying suitable service areas remains
underdeveloped. Simulation Framework for Feeder Location Evaluation (SimFLEX)
uses spatial, demographic, and transport-specific data to run microsimulations
and compute key performance indicators (KPIs), including service
attractiveness, waiting time reduction, and added value. SimFLEX employs
multiple replications to estimate demand and mode choices and integrates
OpenTripPlanner (OTP) for public transport routing and ExMAS for calculating
shared trip attributes and KPIs. For each demand scenario, we model the
traveler learning process using the method of successive averages (MSA),
stabilizing the system. After stabilization, we calculate KPIs for comparative
and sensitivity analyzes. We applied SimFLEX to compare two remote urban areas
in Krakow, Poland - Bronowice and Skotniki - the candidates for service launch.
Our analysis revealed notable differences between analyzed areas: Skotniki
exhibited higher service attractiveness (up to 30%) and added value (up to 7%),
while Bronowice showed greater potential for reducing waiting times (by nearly
77%). To assess the reliability of our model output, we conducted a sensitivity
analysis across a range of alternative-specific constants (ASC). The results
consistently confirmed Skotniki as the superior candidate for service
implementation. SimFLEX can be instrumental for policymakers to estimate new
service performance in the considered area, publicly available and applicable
to various use cases. It can integrate alternative models and approaches,
making it a versatile tool for policymakers and urban planners to enhance urban

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-24 13:20:32</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The lack of generalization in learning-based autonomous driving applications
is shown by the narrow range of road scenarios that vehicles can currently
cover. A generalizable approach should capture many distinct road structures
and topologies, as well as consider traffic participants, and dynamic changes
in the environment, so that vehicles can navigate and perform motion planning
tasks even in the most difficult situations. Designing suitable feature spaces
for neural network-based motion planers that encapsulate all kinds of road
scenarios is still an open research challenge. This paper tackles this
learning-based generalization challenge and shows how graph representations of
road networks can be leveraged by using multidimensional scaling (MDS)
techniques in order to obtain such feature spaces. State-of-the-art graph
representations and MDS approaches are analyzed for the autonomous driving use
case. Finally, the option of embedding graph nodes is discussed in order to
perform easier learning procedures and obtain dimensionality reduction.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Over the last few decades, European rail transport has undergone major
changes as part of the process of liberalization set out in European
regulations. In this context of liberalization, railway undertakings compete
with each other for the limited infrastructure capacity available to offer
their rail services. The infrastructure manager is responsible for the
equitable allocation of infrastructure between all companies in the market,
which is essential to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of this
competitive ecosystem. In this paper, a methodology based on Jain, Gini and
Atkinson equity metrics is used to solve the rail service allocation problem in
a liberalized railway market, analyzing the solutions obtained. The results
show that the proposed methodology and the equity metrics used allow for
equitable planning in different competitiveness scenarios. These results
contrast with solutions where the objective of the infrastructure manager is to
maximize its own profit, without regard for the equitable allocation of
infrastructure. Therefore, the computational tests support the methodology and
metrics used as a planning and decision support tool in a liberalized railway

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-24 12:13:55</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Reliability plays a key role in the experience of a rail traveler. The
reliability of journeys involving transfers is affected by the reliability of
the transfers and the consequences of missing a transfer, as well as the
possible delay of the train used to reach the destination. In this paper, we
propose a flexible method to model the reliability of train journeys with any
number of transfers. The method combines a transfer reliability model based on
gradient boosting responsible for predicting the reliability of transfers
between trains and a delay model based on probabilistic Bayesian regression,
which is used to model train arrival delays. The models are trained on delay
data from four Swedish train stations and evaluated on delay data from another
two stations, in order to evaluate the generalization performance of the
models. We show that the probabilistic delay model, which models train delays
following a mixture distribution with two lognormal components, allows to much
more realistically model the distribution of actual train delays compared to a
standard lognormal model. Finally, we show how these models can be used
together to sample the arrival delay at the final destination of the entire
journey. The results indicate that the method accurately predicts the
reliability for nine out of ten tested journeys. The method could be used to
improve journey planners by providing reliability information to travelers.
Further applications include timetable planning and transport modeling.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Rapid progress in intelligent unmanned systems has presented new
opportunities for mobile crowd sensing (MCS). Today, heterogeneous air-ground
collaborative multi-agent framework, which comprise unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), have presented superior flexibility
and efficiency compared to traditional homogeneous frameworks in complex
sensing tasks. Within this context, task allocation among different agents
always play an important role in improving overall MCS quality. In order to
better allocate tasks among heterogeneous collaborative agents, in this paper,
we investigated two representative complex multi-agent task allocation
scenarios with dual optimization objectives: (1) For AG-FAMT (Air-Ground Few
Agents More Tasks) scenario, the objectives are to maximize the task completion
while minimizing the total travel distance; (2) For AG-MAFT (Air-Ground More
Agents Few Tasks) scenario, where the agents are allocated based on their
locations, has the optimization objectives of minimizing the total travel
distance while reducing travel time cost. To achieve this, we proposed a
Multi-Task Minimum Cost Maximum Flow (MT-MCMF) optimization algorithm tailored
for AG-FAMT, along with a multi-objective optimization algorithm called W-ILP
designed for AG-MAFT, with a particular focus on optimizing the charging path
planning of UAVs. Our experiments based on a large-scale real-world dataset
demonstrated that the proposed two algorithms both outperform baseline

<p class='card-text'>Accurate 3D trajectory data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving. Yet,
traditional datasets are usually captured by fixed sensors mounted on a car and
are susceptible to occlusion. Additionally, such an approach can precisely
reconstruct the dynamic environment in the close vicinity of the measurement
vehicle only, while neglecting objects that are further away. In this paper, we
introduce the DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset (DSC3D), a high-quality,
occlusion-free dataset of 6 degrees of freedom bounding box trajectories
acquired through a novel monocular camera drone tracking pipeline. Our dataset
includes more than 175,000 trajectories of 14 types of traffic participants and
significantly exceeds existing datasets in terms of diversity and scale,
containing many unprecedented scenarios such as complex vehicle-pedestrian
interaction on highly populated urban streets and comprehensive parking
maneuvers from entry to exit. DSC3D dataset was captured in five various
locations in Europe and the United States and include: a parking lot, a crowded
inner-city, a steep urban intersection, a federal highway, and a suburban
intersection. Our 3D trajectory dataset aims to enhance autonomous driving
systems by providing detailed environmental 3D representations, which could
lead to improved obstacle interactions and safety. We demonstrate its utility
across multiple applications including motion prediction, motion planning,
scenario mining, and generative reactive traffic agents. Our interactive online

<p class='card-text'>Effective stock price forecasting (estimating future prices) and prediction
(estimating future price changes) are pivotal for investors, regulatory
agencies, and policymakers. These tasks enable informed decision-making, risk
management, strategic planning, and superior portfolio returns. Despite their
importance, forecasting and prediction are challenging due to the dynamic
nature of stock price data, which exhibit significant temporal variations in
distribution and statistical properties. Additionally, while both forecasting
and prediction targets are derived from the same dataset, their statistical
characteristics differ significantly. Forecasting targets typically follow a
log-normal distribution, characterized by significant shifts in mean and
variance over time, whereas prediction targets adhere to a normal distribution.
Furthermore, although multi-step forecasting and prediction offer a broader
perspective and richer information compared to single-step approaches, it is
much more challenging due to factors such as cumulative errors and long-term
temporal variance. As a result, many previous works have tackled either
single-step stock price forecasting or prediction instead. To address these
issues, we introduce a novel model, termed Patched Channel Integration Encoder
(PCIE), to tackle both stock price forecasting and prediction. In this model,
we utilize multiple stock channels that cover both historical prices and price
changes, and design a novel tokenization method to effectively embed these
channels in a cross-channel and temporally efficient manner. Specifically, the
tokenization process involves univariate patching and temporal learning with a
channel-mixing encoder to reduce cumulative errors. Comprehensive experiments
validate that PCIE outperforms current state-of-the-art models in forecast and
prediction tasks.</p>
