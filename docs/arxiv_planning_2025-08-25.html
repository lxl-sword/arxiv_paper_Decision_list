  Navigation in Urban 3D Environments</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Hichem Cheriet, Khellat Kihel Badra, Chouraqui Samira</h6>

<p class='card-text'>The most crucial challenges for UAVs are planning paths and avoiding
obstacles in their way. In recent years, a wide variety of path-planning
algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have successfully solved
path-planning problems; however, they suffer from multiple challenges and
limitations. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of three widely used
algorithms, namely A*, RRT*, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this paper
conducts extensive experiments in 3D urban city environments cluttered with
obstacles. Three experiments were designed with two scenarios each to test the
aforementioned algorithms. These experiments consider different city map sizes,
different altitudes, and varying obstacle densities and sizes in the
environment. According to the experimental results, the A* algorithm
outperforms the others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO is
especially suitable for tight turns and dense environments, and RRT* offers a
balance and works well across all experiments due to its randomized approach to
finding solutions.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-22 16:35:01</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This work casts the kinodynamic planning problem for car-like vehicles as an
optimization task to compute a minimum-time trajectory and its associated
velocity profile, subject to boundary conditions on velocity, acceleration, and
steering. The approach simultaneously optimizes both the spatial path and the
sequence of acceleration and steering controls, ensuring continuous motion from
a specified initial position and velocity to a target end position and
velocity.The method analyzes the admissible control space and terrain to avoid
local minima. The proposed method operates efficiently in simplicial complex
environments, a preferred terrain representation for capturing intricate 3D
landscapes. The problem is initially posed as a mixed-integer fractional
program with quadratic constraints, which is then reformulated into a
mixed-integer bilinear objective through a variable transformation and
subsequently relaxed to a mixed-integer linear program using McCormick
envelopes. Comparative simulations against planners such as MPPI and log-MPPI
demonstrate that the proposed approach generates solutions 104 times faster
while strictly adhering to the specified constraints</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-22 16:29:11</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Quadrupedal mobile robots can traverse a wider range of terrain types than
their wheeled counterparts but do not perform the same on all terrain types.
These robots are prone to undesirable behaviours like sinking and slipping on
challenging terrains. To combat this issue, we propose a terrain classifier
that provides information on terrain type that can be used in robotic systems
to create a traversability map to plan safer paths for the robot to navigate.
The work presented here is a terrain classifier developed for a Boston Dynamics
Spot robot. Spot provides over 100 measured proprioceptive signals describing
the motions of the robot and its four legs (e.g., foot penetration, forces,
joint angles, etc.). The developed terrain classifier combines dimensionality
reduction techniques to extract relevant information from the signals and then
applies a classification technique to differentiate terrain based on
traversability. In representative field testing, the resulting terrain
classifier was able to identify three different terrain types with an accuracy
of approximately 97%</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Min-Seung Ko, Hao Zhu</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-22 15:18:50</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper develops a new dynamic power profiling approach for modeling
AI-centric datacenter loads and analyzing their impact on grid operations,
particularly their potential to induce wide-area grid oscillations. We
characterize the periodic stochastic power fluctuations inherent to large-scale
AI workloads during both the training and fine-tuning stages, driven by the
state-of-the-art GPU computing architecture designs. These sustained, large
power fluctuations, unlike conventional load ramping, act as persistent forcing
inputs capable of interacting with and amplifying local and inter-area
oscillation modes. Using the WECC 179-bus system as a test case, we examine the
amplitude and variability of oscillatory responses under different factors,
ranging from system strength, penetration level, fluctuation frequency range,
individual datacenter size, to geographical deployment. Simulation results show
that, notably, narrower fluctuation bands, larger single-site capacities, or
dispersed siting can intensify oscillations across multiple modes. Our models
and numerical studies provide a quantitative basis for integrating AI-dominant
electricity demands into grid oscillation studies, and further support the
development of new planning and operational measures to power the continuous AI
load growth.</p>

  Modeling and Exercise Recommendation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Yahya Badran, Christine Preisach</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-22 10:12:35</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-22 09:24:55</h6>
<p class='card-text'>A Bayesian player acting in an infinite multi-player game learns to predict
the other players' strategies if his prior assigns positive probability to
their play (or contains a grain of truth). Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of
truth problem is to find a reasonably large class of strategies that contains
the Bayes-optimal policies with respect to this class, allowing
mutually-consistent beliefs about strategy choice that obey the rules of
Bayesian inference. Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and
the literature contains several related impossibility results. In this paper we
present a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we
construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable
strategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over
the class. When the "environment" is a known repeated stage game, we show
convergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is
unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\varepsilon$-Nash
equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally,
we include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning.
While these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve
a classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be
computationally approximated arbitrarily closely.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The atomic hydrogen anion H$^-$ is the lightest stable anion and its bound
states and resonances are well studied in the literature. Due to the planned
comparison of the bare antiproton to H$^-$ in a Penning trap, we study the
magnetic shielding of H$^-$ using the nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics
theory, by accurately calculating the non-relativistic shielding, as well as
finite nuclear mass, relativistic, and partially QED corrections. We find that
the finite nuclear mass correction is quite significant in H$^-$ contributing
about $0.1\%$ of the total shielding, which is more than twice as much as the
relativistic correction. Our final result for the shielding constant has a

<p class='card-text'>As the global shift toward transportation electrification has accelerated,
capacity planning for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure has become
a critical challenge in the development of low-carbon urban energy systems.
This study proposes the first demand-driven, multi-objective planning model for
optimizing city-scale capacity allocation of EV charging infrastructure. The
model employs a bottom-up approach to estimate charging demand differentiated
by vehicle type-battery electric vehicles (BEVs), extended-range electric
vehicles (EREVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Chongqing, a
rapidly expanding EV hub in China with a strong industrial base, supportive
policies, and diverse urban morphologies, is selected as the case study. The
results show that (1) monthly EV electricity consumption in Chongqing rose from
18.9 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in June 2022 to 57.5 GWh in December 2024, with
associated carbon emissions increasing from 9.9 kilotons of carbon dioxide
(ktCO2) to 30 ktCO2, driven primarily by BEVs; (2) 181,622 additional charging
piles were installed between 2022 and 2024, concentrated in densely populated
areas, reflecting a demand-responsive strategy that prioritizes population
density over geographic coverage; and (3) between 2025 and 2030, EV electricity
demand is projected to reach 1940 GWh, with the number of charging piles
exceeding 1.4 million, and charging demand from EREVs and PHEVs expected to
overtake BEVs later in the period. While Chongqing serves as the pilot area,
the proposed planning platform is adaptable for application in cities
worldwide, enabling cross-regional comparisons under diverse socio-economic,
geographic, and policy conditions. Overall, this work offers policymakers a
versatile tool to support sustainable, cost-effective EV infrastructure
deployment aligned with low-carbon electrification targets in the
transportation sector.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-22 07:31:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This study proposes an integrated heuristic framework for the strategic
optimization of distributed maintenance operations in geo-distributed
production systems (GDPS). It introduces a dual-entity maintenance structure
comprising a Centralized Maintenance Workshop (CMW) and a Mobile Maintenance
Workshop (MMW), aimed at minimizing total long-term maintenance costs. The cost
function incorporates transport, operations, and downtime penalties, optimized
via a two-stage algorithmic approach: a Maintenance Planning Algorithm (MPA)
based on predictive maintenance scheduling, and a Long-term Heuristic
Scheduling Algorithm (LHSA) addressing a capacitated vehicle routing problem
with time windows (CVRPTW). A novel contribution includes a heuristic for CMW
location determination using the weighted barycentre of site failure
probabilities and a discrete selection of MMW capacities. Mixed Integer Linear
Programming (MILP) and a divide-and-conquer heuristic are utilized to handle
the NP-hard nature of the problem. Experimental validation using
Weibull-distributed failure data and various cost scenarios demonstrates that
the proposed Optimised Maintenance and Capacitated Routing (OMCR) framework can
reduce lifecycle maintenance costs by up to 50%, with increased scalability for
systems exceeding 30 GDPS. The framework is applicable to sectors requiring
high availability and centralized servicing, including aerospace, railway, and

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-22 05:42:55</h6>
<p class='card-text'>With the increasing deployment of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) in
unfamiliar and complex environments, Environmental Digital Twins (EDT) that
comprise weather, airspace, and terrain data are critical for safe flight
planning and for maintaining appropriate altitudes during search and
surveillance operations. With the expansion of sUAS capabilities through edge
and cloud computing, accurate EDT are also vital for advanced sUAS
capabilities, like geolocation. However, real-world sUAS deployment introduces
significant sources of uncertainty, necessitating a robust validation process
for EDT components. This paper focuses on the validation of terrain models, one
of the key components of an EDT, for real-world sUAS tasks. These models are
constructed by fusing U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) datasets and satellite
imagery, incorporating high-resolution environmental data to support mission
tasks. Validating both the terrain models and their operational use by sUAS
under real-world conditions presents significant challenges, including limited
data granularity, terrain discontinuities, GPS and sensor inaccuracies, visual
detection uncertainties, as well as onboard resources and timing constraints.
We propose a 3-Dimensions validation process grounded in software engineering
principles, following a workflow across granularity of tests, simulation to
real world, and the analysis of simple to edge conditions. We demonstrate our
approach using a multi-sUAS platform equipped with a Terrain-Aware Digital
Shadow.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-22 02:57:52</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from
diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods
typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on
the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable
to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal
models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an
Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning
modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive
Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which
enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle
retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific
strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach
preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly
task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models.
Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach
matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27

Republicans improved their standing in rural and rural-suburban areas, while

<p class='card-text'>In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

  Manipulators for On-Orbit Servicing</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Gargi Das, Daegyun Choi, Donghoon Kim</h6>

<p class='card-text'>This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization
algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling
between the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing
the system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on
minimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work
investigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve
trajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling
matrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling
behavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength
and directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory
optimization framework. To assess the feasibility of the optimized trajectory,
a sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the
required joint torque inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that explicitly
accounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed
and potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the
control of free-floating SMSs.</p>

  Maps</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Franz Hanke, Antonia Bieringer, Olaf Wysocki, Boris Jutzi</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

  Planning and Low-Level Policies in Mobile Manipulation</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.</p>
