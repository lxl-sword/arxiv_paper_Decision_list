  in Open Agent Systems</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Alireza Saleh Abadi, Leen-Kiat Soh</h6>

<p class='card-text'>In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers
to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a
system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et
al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at
any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or
disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents
change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,
focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem
(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the
overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open
environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static
agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making
them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,
in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent
turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental
stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We
then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural
algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness
directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and
significant performance degradation.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-30 11:32:45</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).</p>

<p class='card-text'>Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARl) has achieved strong results in

teamwork (AHT) relaxes this by allowing collaboration with unknown partners,

with multiple mutually unfamiliar groups of uncontrolled teammates. To address

<p class='card-text'>Frequent natural disasters cause significant losses to human society, and
timely, efficient collection of post-disaster environmental information is the
foundation for effective rescue operations. Due to the extreme complexity of
post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies such as mobile
crowdsensing suffer from weak environmental adaptability, insufficient
professional sensing capabilities, and poor practicality of sensing solutions.
Therefore, this paper explores a heterogeneous multi-agent online collaborative
scheduling algorithm, HoCs-MPQ, to achieve efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoCs-MPQ models collaboration and
conflict relationships among multiple elements through weighted undirected
graph construction, and iteratively solves the maximum weight independent set
based on multi-priority queues, ultimately achieving collaborative sensing
scheduling of time-dependent UA Vs, vehicles, and workers. Specifically, (1)
HoCs-MPQ constructs weighted undirected graph nodes based on collaborative
relationships among multiple elements and quantifies their weights, then models
the weighted undirected graph based on conflict relationships between nodes;
(2) HoCs-MPQ solves the maximum weight independent set based on iterated local
search, and accelerates the solution process using multi-priority queues.
Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive real-world and
simulated data. The experiments show that, compared to baseline methods (e.g.,
HoCs-GREEDY, HoCs-K-WTA, HoCs-MADL, and HoCs-MARL), HoCs-MPQ improves task
completion rates by an average of 54.13%, 23.82%, 14.12%, and 12.89%
respectively, with computation time for single online autonomous scheduling
decisions not exceeding 3 seconds.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) is a recent trend in automated machine
learning, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm's configuration during the
execution process and relieve users from tedious trial-and-error tuning tasks.
Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have improved
the configuration of multiple heterogeneous hyperparameters, making various
parameter configurations for complex algorithms possible. However, many complex
algorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g.,
determining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which
are, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to
sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC
(Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent
inter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a
sequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order
information through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from
synthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization
algorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art
MARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes. Seq-MADAC
establishes a new paradigm for the widespread dependency-aware automated
algorithm configuration. Our code is available at

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-27 03:42:18</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation
plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While
centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a
central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer
from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed
Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed
learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and
limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion
Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.
Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP
employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future
trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby
alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE
methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field
(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This
design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with
minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further
theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation
error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence
stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL
baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its
scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-26 16:21:24</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We consider the distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO) problem, which is
fundamental in accurate trajectory estimation in multi-robot simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM). Conventional iterative approaches linearize a
highly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal
equations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal
estimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO
framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed
PGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where
each action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner
decomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent
edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating
to denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid
policy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local
graph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to
produce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a
comprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
learned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5%
more than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing
inference efficiency by at least 6X. We also demonstrate that actor replication
allows a single learned policy to scale effortlessly to substantially larger
robot teams without any retraining. Code is publicly available at

<p class='card-text'>As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices continuously grows and
application scenarios constantly enrich, the volume of sensor data experiences
an explosive increase. However, substantial data demands considerable energy
during computation and transmission. Redundant deployment or mobile assistance
is essential to cover the target area reliably with fault-prone sensors.
Consequently, the ``butterfly effect" may appear during the IoT operation,
since unreasonable data overlap could result in many duplicate data. To this
end, we propose Senses, a novel online energy saving solution for edge IoT
networks, with the insight of sensing and storing less at the network edge by
adopting Muti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Senses achieves data
de-duplication by dynamically adjusting sensor coverage at the sensor level.
For exceptional cases where sensor coverage cannot be altered, Senses conducts
data partitioning and eliminates redundant data at the controller level.
Furthermore, at the global level, considering the heterogeneity of IoT devices,
Senses balances the operational duration among the devices to prolong the
overall operational duration of edge IoT networks. We evaluate the performance
of Senses through testbed experiments and simulations. The results show that
Senses saves 11.37% of energy consumption on control devices and prolongs 20%
overall operational duration of the IoT device network.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The ability to model interactions among agents is crucial for effective
coordination and understanding their cooperation mechanisms in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, previous efforts to model high-order
interactions have been primarily hindered by the combinatorial explosion or the
opaque nature of their black-box network structures. In this paper, we propose
a novel value decomposition framework, called Continued Fraction Q-Learning
(QCoFr), which can flexibly capture arbitrary-order agent interactions with
only linear complexity $\mathcal{O}\left({n}\right)$ in the number of agents,
thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion when modeling rich cooperation.
Furthermore, we introduce the variational information bottleneck to extract
latent information for estimating credits. This latent information helps agents
filter out noisy interactions, thereby significantly enhancing both cooperation
and interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QCoFr not only
consistently achieves better performance but also provides interpretability
that aligns with our theoretical analysis.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards
desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a
human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On
the other hand, designing external mechanisms (e.g., intrinsic rewards and
human feedback) to coordinate agents mostly relies on empirical studies,
lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ multi-agent
influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the above
issues. First, we introduce the concept of MARL interaction paradigms
(orthogonal to MARL learning paradigms), using MAIDs to analyze and visualize
both unguided self-organization and global guidance mechanisms in MARL. Then,
we design a new MARL interaction paradigm, referred to as the targeted
intervention paradigm that is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the
problem of global guidance can be mitigated. In implementation, we introduce a
causal inference technique, referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI), to
realize the targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a
special class of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates
the primary task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by
maximizing the corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the
bundled relevance graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether
an MARL learning paradigm is workable under the design of an MARL interaction
paradigm. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
targeted intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Social networks have become a crucial source of real-time information for
individuals. The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered
considerable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous
detection technologies. However, the vulnerability and robustness of these
detection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited
control over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the
heterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the
first adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot
control attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.
Specifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts
by reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby
evading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving
social bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social
accounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then
employed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the
attachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a
hierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to
accelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot
detection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the
performance of GNN-based detectors.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning focuses on training the behaviors of
multiple learning agents that coexist in a shared environment. Recently, MARL
models, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep
Q-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging
sequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance
performance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in
which agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action
Decisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which
agents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence
of action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and
predict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a
Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the
sequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL
architecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next
agent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss
function to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential
decision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive
experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo

outperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the
effectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Current macroeconomic models with agent heterogeneity can be broadly divided
into two main groups. Heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium (GE) models, such
as those based on Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) or Krusell-Smith
(KS) approaches, rely on GE and 'rational expectations', somewhat unrealistic
assumptions that make the models very computationally cumbersome, which in turn
limits the amount of heterogeneity that can be modelled. In contrast,
agent-based models (ABMs) can flexibly encompass a large number of arbitrarily
heterogeneous agents, but typically require the specification of explicit
behavioural rules, which can lead to a lengthy trial-and-error
model-development process. To address these limitations, we introduce MARL-BC,
a framework that integrates deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with
Real Business Cycle (RBC) models. We demonstrate that MARL-BC can: (1) recover
textbook RBC results when using a single agent; (2) recover the results of the
mean-field KS model using a large number of identical agents; and (3)
effectively simulate rich heterogeneity among agents, a hard task for
traditional GE approaches. Our framework can be thought of as an ABM if used
with a variety of heterogeneous interacting agents, and can reproduce GE
results in limit cases. As such, it is a step towards a synthesis of these

trustworthy MARL systems requires a deep understanding of robustness, which
ensures stability under uncertainties, and resilience, the ability to recover
from disruptions--a concept extensively studied in control systems but largely
overlooked in MARL. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study
comprising over 82,620 experiments to evaluate cooperation, robustness, and
resilience in MARL across 4 real-world environments, 13 uncertainty types, and
15 hyperparameters. Our key findings are: (1) Under mild uncertainty,
optimizing cooperation improves robustness and resilience, but this link
weakens as perturbations intensify. Robustness and resilience also varies by
algorithm and uncertainty type. (2) Robustness and resilience do not generalize
across uncertainty modalities or agent scopes: policies robust to action noise
for all agents may fail under observation noise on a single agent. (3)
Hyperparameter tuning is critical for trustworthy MARL: surprisingly, standard
practices like parameter sharing, GAE, and PopArt can hurt robustness, while
early stopping, high critic learning rates, and Leaky ReLU consistently help.
By optimizing hyperparameters only, we observe substantial improvement in
cooperation, robustness and resilience across all MARL backbones, with the
phenomenon also generalizing to robust MARL methods across these backbones.

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-13 13:48:38</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Previous work has shown that when multiple selfish Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
are introduced to future cities and start learning optimal routing strategies
using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), they may destabilize traffic
systems, as they would require a significant amount of time to converge to the
optimal solution, equivalent to years of real-world commuting.
  We demonstrate that moving beyond the selfish component in the reward
significantly relieves this issue. If each AV, apart from minimizing its own
travel time, aims to reduce its impact on the system, this will be beneficial
not only for the system-wide performance but also for each individual player in
this routing game.
  By introducing an intrinsic reward signal based on the marginal cost matrix,
we significantly reduce training time and achieve convergence more reliably.
Marginal cost quantifies the impact of each individual action (route-choice) on
the system (total travel time). Including it as one of the components of the
reward can reduce the degree of non-stationarity by aligning agents'
objectives. Notably, the proposed counterfactual formulation preserves the
system's equilibria and avoids oscillations.
  Our experiments show that training MARL algorithms with our novel reward
formulation enables the agents to converge to the optimal solution, whereas the
baseline algorithms fail to do so. We show these effects in both a toy network
and the real-world network of Saint-Arnoult. Our results optimistically
indicate that social awareness (i.e., including marginal costs in routing
decisions) improves both the system-wide and individual performance of future
urban systems with AVs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The empirical success of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has
motivated the search for more efficient and scalable algorithms for large scale
multi-agent systems. However, existing state-of-the-art algorithms do not fully
exploit inter-agent coupling information to develop MARL algorithms. In this
paper, we propose a systematic approach to leverage structures in the
inter-agent couplings for efficient model-free reinforcement learning. We model
the cooperative MARL problem via a Bayesian network and characterize the subset
of agents, termed as the value dependency set, whose information is required by
each agent to estimate its local action value function exactly. Moreover, we
propose a partially decentralized training decentralized execution (P-DTDE)
paradigm based on the value dependency set. We theoretically establish that the
total variance of our P-DTDE policy gradient estimator is less than the
centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) policy gradient estimator.
We derive a multi-agent policy gradient theorem based on the P-DTDE scheme and
develop a scalable actor-critic algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency and
scalability of the proposed algorithm on multi-warehouse resource allocation
and multi-zone temperature control examples. For dense value dependency sets,
we propose an approximation scheme based on truncation of the Bayesian network
and empirically show that it achieves a faster convergence than the exact value
dependence set for applications with a large number of agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Climate policy studies require models that capture the combined effects of
multiple greenhouse gases on global temperature, but these models are
computationally expensive and difficult to embed in reinforcement learning. We
present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a
high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment
loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas
dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network
architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to
surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains
near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\approx 0.0004
\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\times$ faster one-step inference. When
substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it
accelerates end-to-end training by $>\!100\times$. We show that the surrogate

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent systems (MAS) solve complex problems through coordinated
autonomous entities with individual decision-making capabilities. While
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) enables these agents to learn
intelligent strategies, it faces challenges of non-stationarity and partial
observability. Communications among agents offer a solution, but questions
remain about its optimal structure and evaluation. This paper explores two
underexamined aspects: communication topology and information efficiency. We
demonstrate that directed and sequential topologies improve performance while
reducing communication overhead across both homogeneous and heterogeneous
tasks. Additionally, we introduce two metrics -- Information Entropy Efficiency
Index (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) -- to evaluate message
compactness and role differentiation. Incorporating these metrics into training
objectives improves success rates and convergence speed. Our findings highlight

<p class='card-text'>The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it

<p class='card-text'>High Altitude Balloons (HABs) can leverage stratospheric wind layers for
limited horizontal control, enabling applications in reconnaissance,
environmental monitoring, and communications networks. Existing multi-agent HAB
coordination approaches use deterministic methods like Voronoi partitioning and
extremum seeking control for large global constellations, which perform poorly
for smaller teams and localized missions. While single-agent HAB control using
reinforcement learning has been demonstrated on HABs, coordinated multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) has not yet been investigated. This work presents
the first systematic application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
to HAB coordination for distributed area coverage. We extend our previously
developed reinforcement learning simulation environment (RLHAB) to support
cooperative multi-agent learning, enabling multiple agents to operate
simultaneously in realistic atmospheric conditions. We adapt QMIX for HAB area
coverage coordination, leveraging Centralized Training with Decentralized
Execution to address atmospheric vehicle coordination challenges. Our approach
employs specialized observation spaces providing individual state,
environmental context, and teammate data, with hierarchical rewards
prioritizing coverage while encouraging spatial distribution. We demonstrate
that QMIX achieves similar performance to the theoretically optimal geometric

<p class='card-text'>LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team

<p class='card-text'>As climate change intensifies extreme weather events, water disasters pose
growing threats to global communities, making adaptive reservoir management
critical for protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring water security.
Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading
uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These
uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental
variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons
downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional
centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational
complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while
existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve
effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we
present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by
starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment,
separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs
to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In
addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to
adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on
real-world USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\%,
cuts computation by 35\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\%, exhibiting
super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000
nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and
protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) optimizes strategic interactions in
non-cooperative dynamic games, where agents have misaligned objectives.
However, data-driven methods such as multi-agent policy gradients (MA-PG) often
suffer from instability and limit-cycle behaviors. Prior stabilization
techniques typically rely on entropy-based exploration, which slows learning
and increases variance. We propose a model-based approach that incorporates
approximate priors into the reward function as regularization. In linear
quadratic (LQ) games, we prove that such priors stabilize policy gradients and
guarantee local exponential convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium. We
then extend this idea to infinite-horizon nonlinear games by introducing
Multi-agent Guided Policy Search (MA-GPS), which constructs short-horizon local
LQ approximations from trajectories of current policies to guide training.
Experiments on nonlinear vehicle platooning and a six-player strategic
basketball formation show that MA-GPS achieves faster convergence and more

<p class='card-text'>Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL),
where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to
model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL
(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness
to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to
suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can
promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,
are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual
representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that
interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value
functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking
evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem
for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic
risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic
algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative
benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves
coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a

machine learning framework for solving the multi-agent state-constrained
optimal control problem (MASC-OCP). Our method leverages an epigraph-based
reformulation of SC-OCP to simultaneously capture performance and safety, and
approximates its solution via a physics-informed neural network. Scalability is
achieved by training the SC-OCP value function on reduced-agent systems and
deploying them in a decentralized fashion, where each agent relies only on
local observations of its neighbours for decision-making. To further enhance
safety and efficiency, we introduce an Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based
neighbour selection strategy to prioritize safety-critical interactions, and a
receding-horizon policy execution scheme that adapts to dynamic interactions

<p class='card-text'>The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication
networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage
limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing
applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and
security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic
environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel
conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links
that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV
swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV
swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an
integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent
energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed
to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between
equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy
expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory
control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions
across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a
novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking
(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action

in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
