<p class='card-text'>Partial agent failure becomes inevitable when systems scale up, making it
crucial to identify the subset of agents whose compromise would most severely
degrade overall performance. In this paper, we study this Vulnerable Agent
Identification (VAI) problem in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL). We frame VAI as a Hierarchical Adversarial Decentralized Mean Field
Control (HAD-MFC), where the upper level involves an NP-hard combinatorial task
of selecting the most vulnerable agents, and the lower level learns worst-case
adversarial policies for these agents using mean-field MARL. The two problems
are coupled together, making HAD-MFC difficult to solve. To solve this, we
first decouple the hierarchical process by Fenchel-Rockafellar transform,
resulting a regularized mean-field Bellman operator for upper level that
enables independent learning at each level, thus reducing computational
complexity. We then reformulate the upper-level combinatorial problem as a MDP
with dense rewards from our regularized mean-field Bellman operator, enabling
us to sequentially identify the most vulnerable agents by greedy and RL
algorithms. This decomposition provably preserves the optimal solution of the
original HAD-MFC. Experiments show our method effectively identifies more
vulnerable agents in large-scale MARL and the rule-based system, fooling system
into worse failures, and learns a value function that reveals the vulnerability
of each agent.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) holds substantial promise for
intelligent decision-making in complex environments. However, it suffers from a
coordination and scalability bottleneck as the number of agents increases. To
address these issues, we propose the LLM-empowered expert demonstrations
framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (LEED). LEED consists of two
components: a demonstration generation (DG) module and a policy optimization
(PO) module. Specifically, the DG module leverages large language models to
generate instructions for interacting with the environment, thereby producing
high-quality demonstrations. The PO module adopts a decentralized training
paradigm, where each agent utilizes the generated demonstrations to construct
an expert policy loss, which is then integrated with its own policy loss. This
enables each agent to effectively personalize and optimize its local policy
based on both expert knowledge and individual experience. Experimental results
show that LEED achieves superior sample efficiency, time efficiency, and robust
scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major
challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks,
simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures
often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration
rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address
these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural
Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL
algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture
permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers,
canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous
representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on
cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong
baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO
demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for
learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to
robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint
action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent
to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination
through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built
upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching
Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot
coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of
foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT
automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of
subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what
follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and
refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement
loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation
tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In
addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware

<p class='card-text'>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown significant potential in
robotics due to its high sample efficiency and planning capability. However,
extending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the
complexity of joint dynamics. To address this, we propose the Sequential World
Model (SeqWM), a novel framework that integrates the sequential paradigm into
model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. SeqWM employs independent,
sequentially structured agent-wise world models to decompose complex joint
dynamics. Latent rollouts and decision-making are performed through sequential
communication, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its
actions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design enables
explicit intention sharing, enhancing cooperative performance, and reduces
communication overhead to linear complexity. Results in challenging simulated
environments (Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad) show that SeqWM outperforms existing
state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines in both overall
performance and sample efficiency, while exhibiting advanced cooperative
behaviors such as predictive adaptation and role division. Furthermore, SeqWM
has been success fully deployed on physical quadruped robots, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems. Demos and code are available

benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,

<p class='card-text'>In recent years, diversity has emerged as a useful mechanism to enhance the
efficiency of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing
methods predominantly focus on designing policies based on individual agent
characteristics, often neglecting the interplay and mutual influence among
agents during policy formation. To address this gap, we propose Competitive
Diversity through Constructive Conflict (CoDiCon), a novel approach that
incorporates competitive incentives into cooperative scenarios to encourage
policy exchange and foster strategic diversity among agents. Drawing
inspiration from sociological research, which highlights the benefits of
moderate competition and constructive conflict in group decision-making, we
design an intrinsic reward mechanism using ranking features to introduce
competitive motivations. A centralized intrinsic reward module generates and
distributes varying reward values to agents, ensuring an effective balance
between competition and cooperation. By optimizing the parameterized
centralized reward module to maximize environmental rewards, we reformulate the
constrained bilevel optimization problem to align with the original task
objectives. We evaluate our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods in the
SMAC and GRF environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDiCon
achieves superior performance, with competitive intrinsic rewards effectively
promoting diverse and adaptive strategies among cooperative agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>When supersonic plasma flows collide, many physical processes contribute to
the morphology of the resulting shock. One of these processes is the
acceleration of non-thermal ions, which will, eventually, reach relativistic
speeds and become cosmic rays. This process is difficult to simulate in a
computer model because it requires both macro-physics (the overall shape of the
shock) and micro-physics (the interaction between individual particles and the
magnetic field). The combined PIC-MHD method is one of several options to get
around this problem. It is based on the assumption that a plasma can be
described as a combination of a thermal gas, which can be accurately described
as a fluid using grid-based magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and a small non-thermal
component which has to be described as individual particles using
particle-in-cell (PIC). By combining aspects of both methods, we reduce the
computational costs while maintaining the ability to trace the acceleration of
individual particles. We apply this method to a variety of astrophysical shock
configurations to investigate if, and how, they can contribute to the cosmic

other agents. While being straightforward, this approach does not account for
the updates of other agents at the same update step, resulting in
miscoordination. In this paper, we introduce the $K$-Level Policy Gradient
(KPG), a method that recursively updates each agent against the updated
policies of other agents, speeding up the discovery of effective coordinated
policies. We theoretically prove that KPG with finite iterates achieves
monotonic convergence to a local Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. We
provide principled implementations of KPG by applying it to the deep MARL

<p class='card-text'>For groups of autonomous agents to achieve a particular goal, they must
engage in coordination and long-horizon reasoning. However, designing reward
functions to elicit such behavior is challenging. In this paper, we study how
self-supervised goal-reaching techniques can be leveraged to enable agents to
cooperate. The key idea is that, rather than have agents maximize some scalar
reward, agents aim to maximize the likelihood of visiting a certain goal. This
problem setting enables human users to specify tasks via a single goal state
rather than implementing a complex reward function. While the feedback signal
is quite sparse, we will demonstrate that self-supervised goal-reaching
techniques enable agents to learn from such feedback. On MARL benchmarks, our
proposed method outperforms alternative approaches that have access to the same
sparse reward signal as our method. While our method has no explicit mechanism
for exploration, we observe that self-supervised multi-agent goal-reaching
leads to emergent cooperation and exploration in settings where alternative

<p class='card-text'>As sixth-generation (6G) networks move toward ultra-dense, intelligent edge
environments, efficient resource management under stringent privacy, mobility,

Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Fed-MARL) framework that
incorporates cross-layer orchestration of both the MAC layer and application
layer for energy-efficient, privacy-preserving, and real-time resource
management across heterogeneous edge devices. Each agent uses a Deep Recurrent
Q-Network (DRQN) to learn decentralized policies for task offloading, spectrum
access, and CPU energy adaptation based on local observations (e.g., queue
length, energy, CPU usage, and mobility). To protect privacy, we introduce a
secure aggregation protocol based on elliptic curve Diffie Hellman key
exchange, which ensures accurate model updates without exposing raw data to
semi-honest adversaries. We formulate the resource management problem as a
partially observable multi-agent Markov decision process (POMMDP) with a
multi-objective reward function that jointly optimizes latency, energy

<p class='card-text'>Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant progress
in solving complex multi-player games through self-play. However, training
effective adversarial policies requires millions of experience samples and
substantial computational resources. Moreover, these policies lack
interpretability, hindering their practical deployment. Recently, researchers
have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
programmatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based
policies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.
Inspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating
programmatic policies in multi-player games. PolicyEvolve significantly reduces
reliance on manually crafted policy code, achieving high-performance policies
with minimal environmental interactions. The framework comprises four modules:
Global Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool
preserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool
stores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently
high-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The
Policy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top
three policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the
current iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy
using feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited
into the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves
a sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it
is integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction
data from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes
directional improvements to guide the Policy Planner</p>

<p class='card-text'>The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Can we build efficient Quantum Error Correction (QEC) that adapts on the fly
to time-varying noise? In this work we say yes, and show how. We present a two
level framework based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) that learns to correct
even non-stationary errors from scratch. At the first level we take advantage
of model-free Multi-Agent RL (MARL) to automatically discover full QEC cycle --
logical state encoding, stabilizer measurements, and recovery -- without any
prior system knowledge, relying only on orthogonality conditions. Leveraging
the stabilizer formalism, we demonstrate that our MARL framework can discover
novel QEC codes tailored for multi-level quantum architectures. At the second
level we introduce BRAVE (Bandit Retraining for Adaptive Variational Error
correction), an efficient algorithm that tunes the variational layer on the fly
to change the physical basis of the errors, adapting the QEC code to
time-varying noise while minimizing computational overhead and reducing the
number of retraining steps. By combining our MARL and BRAVE approaches and
testing them on multi-level systems subjected to competing bit- and phase-flip

<p class='card-text'>World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have
demonstrated its application potential in modern games. Beginning with
foundational work and progressing to landmark achievements such as AlphaStar in
StarCraft II and OpenAI Five in Dota 2, MARL has proven capable of achieving
superhuman performance across diverse game environments through techniques like
self-play, supervised learning, and deep reinforcement learning. With its
growing impact, a comprehensive review has become increasingly important in
this field. This paper aims to provide a thorough examination of MARL's
application from turn-based two-agent games to real-time multi-agent video
games including popular genres such as Sports games, First-Person Shooter (FPS)
games, Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games and Multiplayer Online Battle Arena
(MOBA) games. We further analyze critical challenges posed by MARL in video
games, including nonstationary, partial observability, sparse rewards, team
coordination, and scalability, and highlight successful implementations in
games like Rocket League, Minecraft, Quake III Arena, StarCraft II, Dota 2,
Honor of Kings, etc. This paper offers insights into MARL in video game AI
systems, proposes a novel method to estimate game complexity, and suggests
future research directions to advance MARL and its applications in game
development, inspiring further innovation in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions
while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to
centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited
observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized
framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the
specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared
server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as
a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global
resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe
reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global
goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate
our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and
independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cybersecurity defense involves interactions between adversarial parties
(namely defenders and hackers), making multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) an ideal approach for modeling and learning strategies for these
scenarios. This paper addresses one of the key challenges to MARL, the
complexity of simultaneous training of agents in nontrivial environments, and
presents a novel policy-based Nash Q-learning to directly converge onto a
steady equilibrium. We demonstrate the successful implementation of this
algorithm in a notable complex cyber defense simulation treated as a two-player
zero-sum Markov game setting. We propose the Nash Q-Network, which aims to
learn Nash-optimal strategies that translate to robust defenses in
cybersecurity settings. Our approach incorporates aspects of proximal policy
optimization (PPO), deep Q-network (DQN), and the Nash-Q algorithm, addressing
common challenges like non-stationarity and instability in multi-agent
learning. The training process employs distributed data collection and
carefully designed neural architectures for both agents and critics.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-28 14:16:17</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-28 13:47:40</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) and agent
systems has heightened interest in mobile GUI agents that can reliably
translate natural language into interface operations. Existing single-agent
approaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although
multi-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress
in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by
inefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To
address these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved
reinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates
MARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one
agent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable
training and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we
provide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem,
and convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled
optimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a
Navigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and
an Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and
low-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strong
capability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential as
a general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cyber defense requires automating defensive decision-making under stealthy,
deceptive, and continuously evolving adversarial strategies. The FlipIt game
provides a foundational framework for modeling interactions between a defender
and an advanced adversary that compromises a system without being immediately
detected. In FlipIt, the attacker and defender compete to control a shared
resource by performing a Flip action and paying a cost. However, the existing
FlipIt frameworks rely on a small number of heuristics or specialized learning
techniques, which can lead to brittleness and the inability to adapt to new
attacks. To address these limitations, we introduce PoolFlip, a multi-agent gym
environment that extends the FlipIt game to allow efficient learning for
attackers and defenders. Furthermore, we propose Flip-PSRO, a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that leverages population-based training
to train defender agents equipped to generalize against a range of unknown,
potentially adaptive opponents. Our empirical results suggest that Flip-PSRO
defenders are $2\times$ more effective than baselines to generalize to a
heuristic attack not exposed in training. In addition, our newly designed
ownership-based utility functions ensure that Flip-PSRO defenders maintain a
high level of control while optimizing performance.</p>

real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial

Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection

<p class='card-text'>Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a
workload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured
coordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task
allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout
and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing
an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare
workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address
this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines
fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment.
Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired
environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling
impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this
problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with
four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics.
Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to
task-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that
capture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for
studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort

<p class='card-text'>Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is
fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints
and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP
communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,
a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs
act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,

<p class='card-text'>To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors. While prior work typically
evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward signals, it is
unclear how to infer agent contributions in the absence of any value feedback.
In this work, we investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors
can be extracted solely by analyzing the policy distribution. Inspired by the
phenomenon that intelligent agents tend to pursue convergent instrumental
values, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a method based on
information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each agent's causal
influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment. Specifically, ICVs
measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies by assessing their
decision (un)certainty and preference alignment. By analyzing action effects on
policies and value functions across cooperative and competitive MARL tasks, our
method identifies which agent behaviors are beneficial to team success, either
by fostering deterministic decisions or by preserving flexibility for future
action choices, while also revealing the extent to which agents adopt similar
or diverse strategies. Our proposed method offers novel insights into
cooperation dynamics and enhances explainability in MARL systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) typically rely on pre-analysis of
the target area, network size, and sensor coverage to determine initial
deployment. This often results in significant overlap to ensure continued
network operation despite sensor energy depletion. With the emergence of Mobile
Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs), issues such as sensor failure and static
coverage limitations can be more effectively addressed through mobility. This
paper proposes a novel deployment strategy in which mobile sensors autonomously
position themselves to maximize area coverage, eliminating the need for
predefined policies. A live camera system, combined with deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), monitors the network by detecting sensor LED indicators and
evaluating real-time coverage. Rewards based on coverage efficiency and sensor
movement are computed at each learning step and shared across the network
through a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework, enabling
decentralized, cooperative sensor control. Key contributions include a
vision-based, low-cost coverage evaluation method; a scalable MARL-DRL
framework for autonomous deployment; and a self-reconfigurable system that
adjusts sensor positioning in response to energy depletion. Compared to
traditional distance-based localization, the proposed method achieves a 26.5%
improvement in coverage, a 32% reduction in energy consumption, and a 22%
decrease in redundancy, extending network lifetime by 45%. This approach
significantly enhances adaptability, energy efficiency, and robustness in
MWSNs, offering a practical deployment solution within the IoT framework.</p>
