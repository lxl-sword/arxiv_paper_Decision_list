<p class='card-text'>Accurate prediction of urban wind flow is essential for urban planning,
pedestrian safety, and environmental management. Yet, it remains challenging
due to uncertain boundary conditions and the high cost of conventional CFD
simulations. This paper presents the use of the modular and efficient
uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework OpenLB-UQ for urban wind flow
simulations. We specifically use the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) coupled
with a stochastic collocation (SC) approach based on generalized polynomial
chaos (gPC). The framework introduces a relative-error noise model for inflow
wind speeds based on real measurements. The model is propagated through a
non-intrusive SC LBM pipeline using sparse-grid quadrature. Key quantities of
interest, including mean flow fields, standard deviations, and vertical
profiles with confidence intervals, are efficiently computed without altering
the underlying deterministic solver. We demonstrate this on a real urban
scenario, highlighting how uncertainty localizes in complex flow regions such
as wakes and shear layers. The results show that the SC LBM approach provides
accurate, uncertainty-aware predictions with significant computational
efficiency, making OpenLB-UQ a practical tool for real-time urban wind
analysis.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-25 15:58:19</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Robot swarms require cohesive collective behaviour to address diverse
challenges, including shape formation and decision-making. Existing approaches
often treat consensus in discrete and continuous decision spaces as distinct
problems. We present DANCeRS, a unified, distributed algorithm leveraging
Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to achieve consensus in both domains. By
representing a swarm as a factor graph our method ensures scalability and
robustness in dynamic environments, relying on purely peer-to-peer message
passing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our general framework through two
applications where agents in a swarm must achieve consensus on global behaviour
whilst relying on local communication. In the first, robots must perform path
planning and collision avoidance to create shape formations. In the second, we
show how the same framework can be used by a group of robots to form a
consensus over a set of discrete decisions. Experimental results highlight our
method's scalability and efficiency compared to recent approaches to these
problems making it a promising solution for multi-robot systems requiring
distributed consensus. We encourage the reader to see the supplementary video

<p class='card-text'>Join ordering is a key factor in query performance, yet traditional
cost-based optimizers often produce sub-optimal plans due to inaccurate
cardinality estimates in multi-predicate, multi-join queries. Existing
alternatives such as learning-based optimizers and adaptive query processing
improve accuracy but can suffer from high training costs, poor generalization,
or integration challenges. We present an extension of OmniSketch - a
probabilistic data structure combining count-min sketches and K-minwise hashing
- to enable multi-join cardinality estimation without assuming uniformity and
independence. Our approach introduces the OmniSketch join estimator, ensures
sketch interoperability across tables, and provides an algorithm to process
alpha-acyclic join graphs. Our experiments on SSB-skew and JOB-light show that
OmniSketch-enhanced cost-based optimization can improve estimation accuracy and
plan quality compared to DuckDB. For SSB-skew, we show intermediate result
decreases up to 1,077x and execution time decreases up to 3.19x. For JOB-light,
OmniSketch join cardinality estimation shows occasional individual improvements
but largely suffers from a loss of witnesses due to unfavorable join graph
shapes and large numbers of unique values in foreign key columns.</p>

<p class='card-text'>OpenStar Technologies is a private fusion company exploring the levitated
dipole concept for commercial fusion energy production. OpenStar has
manufactured a new generation of levitated dipole experiment, called "Junior",
leveraging recent advances made in high-temperature superconducting magnet
technologies. Junior houses a ~5.6 T REBCO high-temperature superconducting
magnet in a 5.2 m vacuum chamber, with plasma heating achieved via < 50 kW of
electron cyclotron resonance heating power. Importantly, this experiment
integrates novel high temperature superconductor power supply technology on
board the dipole magnet. Recently OpenStar has completed first experimental
campaigns with the Junior experiment, achieving first plasmas in late 2024.
Experiments conducted with the full levitated system are planned for 2025. This

<p class='card-text'>Urban climate resilience requires more than high-resolution data; it demands
systems that embed data collection, interpretation, and action within the daily
lives of citizens. This chapter presents a scalable, citizen-centric framework
that reimagines environmental infrastructure through participatory sensing,
open analytics, and prescriptive urban planning tools. Applied in Pune, India,
the framework comprises three interlinked modules: (1) a smartphone-based
measurement toolkit enhanced by AI segmentation to extract tree height, canopy
diameter, and trunk girth; (2) a percentile-based model using satellite-derived
Land Surface Temperature to calculate localized cooling through two new
metrics, Cooling Efficacy and Ambient Heat Relief; and (3) an eco-routing
engine that guides mobility using a Static Environmental Quality score, based
on tree density, species diversity, and cumulative carbon sequestration.
Together, these modules form a closed feedback loop where citizens generate
actionable data and benefit from personalized, sustainable interventions. This
framework transforms open data from a passive repository into an active
platform for shared governance and environmental equity. In the face of growing
ecological inequality and data centralization, this chapter presents a
replicable model for citizen-driven urban intelligence, reframing planning as a
co-produced, climate-resilient, and radically local practice.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-25 02:03:36</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Push-1 is one of the simplest abstract frameworks for motion planning;
however, the complexity of deciding if a Push-1 problem can be solved was a
several-decade-old open question. We resolve the complexity of the motion
planning problem Push-1 by showing that it is PSPACE-complete, and we formally
verify the correctness of our constructions. Our results build upon a recent
work which demonstrated that Push-1F (a variant of Push-1 with fixed blocks)
and Push-k for $k \geq 2$ (a variant of Push-1 where the agent can push $k$
blocks at once) are PSPACE-complete and more generally on the
motion-planning-though-gadgets framework.
  In the process of resolving this open problem, we make two general
contributions to the motion planning complexity theory. First, our proof
technique extends the standard motion planning framework by assigning the agent
a state. This state is preserved when traversing between gadgets but can change
when taking transitions in gadgets. Second, we designed and implemented a
system, GADGETEER, for computationally verifying the behavior of systems of
gadgets. This system is agnostic to the underlying motion planning problem, and
allows for formally verifying the correspondence between a low-level
construction and a high-level system of gadgets as well as automatically
synthesizing gadgets from low-level constructions. In the case of Push-1, we
use this system to formally prove that our constructions match our high-level
specifications of their behavior. This culminates in the construction and
verification of a self-closing door, as deciding reachability in a system of
self-closing doors is PSPACE-complete.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Dashboards are powerful visualization tools for data-driven decision-making,
integrating multiple interactive views that allow users to explore, filter, and
navigate data. Unlike static charts, dashboards support rich interactivity,
which is essential for uncovering insights in real-world analytical workflows.
However, existing question-answering benchmarks for data visualizations largely
overlook this interactivity, focusing instead on static charts. This limitation
severely constrains their ability to evaluate the capabilities of modern
multimodal agents designed for GUI-based reasoning. To address this gap, we
introduce DashboardQA, the first benchmark explicitly designed to assess how
vision-language GUI agents comprehend and interact with real-world dashboards.
The benchmark includes 112 interactive dashboards from Tableau Public and 405
question-answer pairs with interactive dashboards spanning five categories:
multiple-choice, factoid, hypothetical, multi-dashboard, and conversational. By
assessing a variety of leading closed- and open-source GUI agents, our analysis
reveals their key limitations, particularly in grounding dashboard elements,
planning interaction trajectories, and performing reasoning. Our findings
indicate that interactive dashboard reasoning is a challenging task overall for
all the VLMs evaluated. Even the top-performing agents struggle; for instance,
the best agent based on Gemini-Pro-2.5 achieves only 38.69% accuracy, while the
OpenAI CUA agent reaches just 22.69%, demonstrating the benchmark's significant
difficulty. We release DashboardQA at https://github.com/vis-nlp/DashboardQA</p>

<p class='card-text'>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
tasks, exhibiting emergent, human-like thinking patterns. Despite their
advances, we identify a fundamental limitation: current LRMs lack a dedicated
meta-level cognitive system-an essential faculty in human cognition that
enables "thinking about thinking". This absence leaves their emergent abilities
uncontrollable (non-adaptive reasoning), unreliable (intermediate error), and
inflexible (lack of a clear methodology). To address this gap, we introduce
Meta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit
metacognitive capabilities. Drawing on principles from cognitive science,
Meta-R1 decomposes the reasoning process into distinct object-level and
meta-level components, orchestrating proactive planning, online regulation, and
adaptive early stopping within a cascaded framework. Experiments on three
challenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that
Meta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to
27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and
improving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts;

<p class='card-text'>With the rapidly increased number of vehicles in urban areas, existing road
infrastructure struggles to accommodate modern traffic demands, resulting in
the issue of congestion. This highlights the importance of efficient path
planning strategies. However, most recent navigation models focus solely on
deterministic or time-dependent networks, while overlooking the correlations
and the stochastic nature of traffic flows. In this work, we address the
reliable shortest path problem within stochastic transportation networks under
certain dependencies. We propose a path planning solution that integrates the
decision Transformer with the Generalized Policy Gradient (GPG) framework.
Based on the decision Transformer's capability to model long-term dependencies,
our proposed solution improves the accuracy and stability of path decisions.
Experimental results on the Sioux Falls Network (SFN) demonstrate that our

from these decisions, but only when individuals arrive at the same time and
choose the same route. Although motivated by bird migration, our model applies
to scenarios such as traffic planning, disaster evacuation, and other animal
movements. Early arrivals secure better territories, while traveling together
enhances navigation accuracy, foraging efficiency, and energy efficiency.
Longer or more difficult migration routes reduce predation risks but increase
travel costs, such as higher elevations and scarce food resources. Our analysis
reveals a richer set of subgame perfect equilibria (SPEs) and heightened

<p class='card-text'>Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early
detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic
(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-23 14:36:48</h6>
<p class='card-text'>As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming
increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing
path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking.
The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory
planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves
maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory,
particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based
rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above
challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time
efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance
framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned
trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal
smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the
proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path
adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to
maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility
of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time
efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other
iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the
proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle,
demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Studies of nuclear fission over recent decades have led to a well-defined
mapping of neutron and proton shell effects across the nuclear chart,
particularly within the valley of stability. These shell effects play a crucial
role in driving the asymmetric splitting of fissioning nuclei, as reflected in
fission yields that are strongly influenced by spherical and deformed shell
closures. In the actinide region, the existence of two primary fission modes,
standard I and standard II, has been well-established. These fission modes are
associated with the proton (neutron) shells at $Z=52$ ($N=82$) and $Z=56$
($N=88$), respectively. Recently, a new proton shell around $Z=36$ has been
found for the lighter fission fragments of pre-actinide nuclei. This discovery
demonstrates that as we expand fission studies towards more exotic regions of
the nuclear chart, new shell structures emerge. In this proposal, we aim to
explore for the first time the most neutron-deficient isotopes of Th, Ac, and
Ra. This region offers a unique opportunity to investigate stabilization
effects around the spherical neutron shell $N=50$. To achieve this, we plan to
use a primary beam of $^{238}$U at 1~GeV/u together with the Fragment Separator
(FRS) to produce secondary beams of $^{213-216}$Th, $^{209-214}$Ac and
$^{207-213}$Ra. For the investigation of the fission process, we will use the
experimental methodology successfully applied in the S415, S438, and S455
experiments, being a continuation of those studies. Fission will be induced by
electromagnetic-excitation (Coulex) reactions in inverse kinematics on an
active target composed of Pb and C foils. The resulting fission fragments,
together with emitted neutrons, will be measured using the R$^3$B experimental
setup, which allows for complete kinematic measurements.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy,
surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis.
While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant
progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational
efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize
performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy
for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient
dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features
a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at
training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the
noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.
Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),
and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature
representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale
segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss
function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA

EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse

<p class='card-text'>We introduce WebSight, a vision-based autonomous web agent, designed to
interact with web environments purely through visual perception, eliminating
dependence on HTML or DOM-based inputs. Central to our approach we introduce
our new model, WebSight-7B, a fine-tuned vision-language model optimized for UI
element interaction, trained using LoRA on a web-focused subset of the
Wave-UI-25K dataset. WebSight integrates this model into a modular multi-agent
architecture, comprising planning, reasoning, vision-action, and verification
agents, coordinated through an episodic memory mechanism.
  WebSight-7B achieves a top-1 accuracy of 58.84% on the Showdown Clicks
benchmark, outperforming several larger generalist models while maintaining
lower latency. The full WebSight agent achieves a 68.0% success rate on the
WebVoyager benchmark, surpassing systems from labs such as OpenAI (61.0%) and
HCompany (Runner H, 67.0%). Among tasks completed, WebSight answers correctly
97.14% of the time, indicating high precision. Together, WebSight and
WebSight-7B establish a new standard for interpretable, robust, and efficient
visual web navigation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate segmentation of laryngo-pharyngeal tumors is crucial for precise
diagnosis and effective treatment planning. However, traditional
single-modality imaging methods often fall short of capturing the complex
anatomical and pathological features of these tumors. In this study, we present
an innovative multi-modality representation learning framework based on the
`Align-Disentangle-Fusion' mechanism that seamlessly integrates 2D White Light
Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) pairs to enhance segmentation
performance. A cornerstone of our approach is multi-scale distribution
alignment, which mitigates modality discrepancies by aligning features across
multiple transformer layers. Furthermore, a progressive feature disentanglement
strategy is developed with the designed preliminary disentanglement and
disentangle-aware contrastive learning to effectively separate
modality-specific and shared features, enabling robust multimodal contrastive
learning and efficient semantic fusion. Comprehensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving superior accuracy across diverse real clinical scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The fast development of technology and artificial intelligence has
significantly advanced Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research, emphasizing the need
for extensive simulation testing. Accurate and adaptable maps are critical in
AV development, serving as the foundation for localization, path planning, and
scenario testing. However, creating simulation-ready maps is often difficult
and resource-intensive, especially with simulators like CARLA (CAR Learning to
Act). Many existing workflows require significant computational resources or
rely on specific simulators, limiting flexibility for developers. This paper
presents a custom workflow to streamline map creation for AV development,
demonstrated through the generation of a 3D map of a parking lot at Ontario
Tech University. Future work will focus on incorporating SLAM technologies,
optimizing the workflow for broader simulator compatibility, and exploring more
flexible handling of latitude and longitude values to enhance map generation

<p class='card-text'>The rapid proliferation of Generative AI (GenAI) into diverse, high-stakes
domains necessitates robust and reproducible evaluation methods. However,
practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common
metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g.,
automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g.,
text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI
system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI
Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and
standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible
framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for
unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images,
audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end
analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside
direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility
through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI
Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to
efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve
development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems,
aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment. Since its
release on PyPI in Jun 2025, the tool has been downloaded over 13K times,
across versions, by Aug 2025, demonstrating growing community interest.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The most crucial challenges for UAVs are planning paths and avoiding
obstacles in their way. In recent years, a wide variety of path-planning
algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have successfully solved
path-planning problems; however, they suffer from multiple challenges and
limitations. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of three widely used
algorithms, namely A*, RRT*, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this paper
conducts extensive experiments in 3D urban city environments cluttered with
obstacles. Three experiments were designed with two scenarios each to test the
aforementioned algorithms. These experiments consider different city map sizes,
different altitudes, and varying obstacle densities and sizes in the
environment. According to the experimental results, the A* algorithm
outperforms the others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO is
especially suitable for tight turns and dense environments, and RRT* offers a
balance and works well across all experiments due to its randomized approach to
finding solutions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This work casts the kinodynamic planning problem for car-like vehicles as an
optimization task to compute a minimum-time trajectory and its associated
velocity profile, subject to boundary conditions on velocity, acceleration, and
steering. The approach simultaneously optimizes both the spatial path and the
sequence of acceleration and steering controls, ensuring continuous motion from
a specified initial position and velocity to a target end position and
velocity.The method analyzes the admissible control space and terrain to avoid
local minima. The proposed method operates efficiently in simplicial complex
environments, a preferred terrain representation for capturing intricate 3D
landscapes. The problem is initially posed as a mixed-integer fractional
program with quadratic constraints, which is then reformulated into a
mixed-integer bilinear objective through a variable transformation and
subsequently relaxed to a mixed-integer linear program using McCormick
envelopes. Comparative simulations against planners such as MPPI and log-MPPI

<p class='card-text'>Quadrupedal mobile robots can traverse a wider range of terrain types than
their wheeled counterparts but do not perform the same on all terrain types.
These robots are prone to undesirable behaviours like sinking and slipping on
challenging terrains. To combat this issue, we propose a terrain classifier
that provides information on terrain type that can be used in robotic systems
to create a traversability map to plan safer paths for the robot to navigate.
The work presented here is a terrain classifier developed for a Boston Dynamics
Spot robot. Spot provides over 100 measured proprioceptive signals describing
the motions of the robot and its four legs (e.g., foot penetration, forces,
joint angles, etc.). The developed terrain classifier combines dimensionality
reduction techniques to extract relevant information from the signals and then
applies a classification technique to differentiate terrain based on
traversability. In representative field testing, the resulting terrain
classifier was able to identify three different terrain types with an accuracy
of approximately 97%</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper develops a new dynamic power profiling approach for modeling
AI-centric datacenter loads and analyzing their impact on grid operations,
particularly their potential to induce wide-area grid oscillations. We
characterize the periodic stochastic power fluctuations inherent to large-scale
AI workloads during both the training and fine-tuning stages, driven by the
state-of-the-art GPU computing architecture designs. These sustained, large
power fluctuations, unlike conventional load ramping, act as persistent forcing
inputs capable of interacting with and amplifying local and inter-area
oscillation modes. Using the WECC 179-bus system as a test case, we examine the
amplitude and variability of oscillatory responses under different factors,
ranging from system strength, penetration level, fluctuation frequency range,
individual datacenter size, to geographical deployment. Simulation results show
that, notably, narrower fluctuation bands, larger single-site capacities, or
dispersed siting can intensify oscillations across multiple modes. Our models
and numerical studies provide a quantitative basis for integrating AI-dominant
electricity demands into grid oscillation studies, and further support the
development of new planning and operational measures to power the continuous AI
load growth.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.</p>

<p class='card-text'>A Bayesian player acting in an infinite multi-player game learns to predict
the other players' strategies if his prior assigns positive probability to
their play (or contains a grain of truth). Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of
truth problem is to find a reasonably large class of strategies that contains
the Bayes-optimal policies with respect to this class, allowing
mutually-consistent beliefs about strategy choice that obey the rules of
Bayesian inference. Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and
the literature contains several related impossibility results. In this paper we
present a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we
construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable
strategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over
the class. When the "environment" is a known repeated stage game, we show
convergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is
unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\varepsilon$-Nash
equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally,
we include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning.
While these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve
a classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be
computationally approximated arbitrarily closely.</p>

<p class='card-text'>As the global shift toward transportation electrification has accelerated,
capacity planning for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure has become
a critical challenge in the development of low-carbon urban energy systems.
This study proposes the first demand-driven, multi-objective planning model for
optimizing city-scale capacity allocation of EV charging infrastructure. The
model employs a bottom-up approach to estimate charging demand differentiated
by vehicle type-battery electric vehicles (BEVs), extended-range electric
vehicles (EREVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Chongqing, a
rapidly expanding EV hub in China with a strong industrial base, supportive
policies, and diverse urban morphologies, is selected as the case study. The
results show that (1) monthly EV electricity consumption in Chongqing rose from
18.9 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in June 2022 to 57.5 GWh in December 2024, with
associated carbon emissions increasing from 9.9 kilotons of carbon dioxide
(ktCO2) to 30 ktCO2, driven primarily by BEVs; (2) 181,622 additional charging
piles were installed between 2022 and 2024, concentrated in densely populated
areas, reflecting a demand-responsive strategy that prioritizes population
density over geographic coverage; and (3) between 2025 and 2030, EV electricity
demand is projected to reach 1940 GWh, with the number of charging piles
exceeding 1.4 million, and charging demand from EREVs and PHEVs expected to
overtake BEVs later in the period. While Chongqing serves as the pilot area,
the proposed planning platform is adaptable for application in cities
worldwide, enabling cross-regional comparisons under diverse socio-economic,
geographic, and policy conditions. Overall, this work offers policymakers a
versatile tool to support sustainable, cost-effective EV infrastructure
deployment aligned with low-carbon electrification targets in the
transportation sector.</p>
