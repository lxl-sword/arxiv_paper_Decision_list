<p class='card-text'>Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL
approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.</p>

  Manipulation</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Learned world models hold significant potential for robotic manipulation, as
they can serve as simulator for real-world interactions. While extensive
progress has been made in 2D video-based world models, these approaches often
lack geometric and spatial reasoning, which is essential for capturing the
physical structure of the 3D world. To address this limitation, we introduce
iMoWM, a novel interactive world model designed to generate color images, depth
maps, and robot arm masks in an autoregressive manner conditioned on actions.
To overcome the high computational cost associated with three-dimensional
information, we propose MMTokenizer, which unifies multi-modal inputs into a
compact token representation. This design enables iMoWM to leverage large-scale
pretrained VideoGPT models while maintaining high efficiency and incorporating
richer physical information. With its multi-modal representation, iMoWM not
only improves the visual quality of future predictions but also serves as an
effective simulator for model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and
facilitates real-world imitation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of iMoWM across these tasks, showcasing the advantages of
multi-modal world modeling for robotic manipulation. Homepage:

<p class='card-text'>Effective exploration remains a central challenge in model-based
reinforcement learning (MBRL), particularly in high-dimensional continuous
control tasks where sample efficiency is crucial. A prominent line of recent
work leverages learned policies as proposal distributions for Model-Predictive
Path Integral (MPPI) planning. Initial approaches update the sampling policy
independently of the planner distribution, typically maximizing a learned value
function with deterministic policy gradient and entropy regularization.
However, because the states encountered during training depend on the MPPI
planner, aligning the sampling policy with the planner improves the accuracy of
value estimation and long-term performance. To this end, recent methods update
the sampling policy by minimizing KL divergence to the planner distribution or
by introducing planner-guided regularization into the policy update. In this
work, we unify these MPPI-based reinforcement learning methods under a single
framework by introducing Policy Optimization-Model Predictive Control (PO-MPC),
a family of KL-regularized MBRL methods that integrate the planner's action
distribution as a prior in policy optimization. By aligning the learned policy
with the planner's behavior, PO-MPC allows more flexibility in the policy
updates to trade off Return maximization and KL divergence minimization. We
clarify how prior approaches emerge as special cases of this family, and we
explore previously unstudied variations. Our experiments show that these
extended configurations yield significant performance improvements, advancing
the state of the art in MPPI-based RL.</p>

<p class='card-text'>A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample
inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive
environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates
this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate
synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world
models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects
and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally
inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly
influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we
introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic
modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich
the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived
from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level
motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic
categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model
(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments
demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k
benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new
record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\%
performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark. Our code is
released at https://github.com/Ultraman-Tiga1/DyMoDreamer.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown significant potential in
robotics due to its high sample efficiency and planning capability. However,
extending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the
complexity of joint dynamics and the reliance on synchronous communication.
SeqWM employs independent, autoregressive agent-wise world models to represent
joint dynamics, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its
actions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design lowers
modeling complexity, alleviates the reliance on communication synchronization,
and enables the emergence of advanced cooperative behaviors through explicit
intention sharing. Experiments in challenging simulated environments
(Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad) demonstrate that SeqWM outperforms existing
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free baselines in both overall
performance and sample efficiency, while exhibiting advanced cooperative
behaviors such as predictive adaptation, temporal alignment, and role division.
Furthermore, SeqWM has been success fully deployed on physical quadruped
robots, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems.

  Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-16 00:13:14</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In visuomotor policy learning, the control policy for the robotic agent is
derived directly from visual inputs. The typical approach, where a policy and
vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel
visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy
network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent
developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is
more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has
found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness
in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show
that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline
model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying
levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can
maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in
promoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence
for their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Traditional RL-based locomotion controllers often suffer from low data
efficiency, requiring extensive interaction to achieve robust performance. We
present a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework that improves
sample efficiency for quadrupedal locomotion by appending synthetic data to the
end of standard rollouts in PPO-based controllers, following the Dyna-Style
paradigm. A predictive model, trained alongside the policy, generates
short-horizon synthetic transitions that are gradually integrated using a
scheduling strategy based on the policy update iterations. Through an ablation
study, we identified a strong correlation between sample efficiency and rollout
length, which guided the design of our experiments. We validated our approach
in simulation on the Unitree Go1 robot and showed that replacing part of the
simulated steps with synthetic ones not only mimics extended rollouts but also
improves policy return and reduces variance. Finally, we demonstrate that this
improvement transfers to the ability to track a wide range of locomotion
commands using fewer simulated steps.</p>

<p class='card-text'>There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that
leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While
early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared
to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical
due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can
approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver
efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts,
which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples
trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled
using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a
learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables
efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator
gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation
rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and
speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality
of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other
first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark
control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot,
across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-09 14:11:37</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The rapid growth of the digital economy and artificial intelligence has
transformed cloud data centers into essential infrastructure with substantial
energy consumption and carbon emission, necessitating effective energy
management. However, existing methods face challenges such as incomplete
information, uncertain parameters, and dynamic environments, which hinder their
real-world implementation. This paper proposes an adaptive power capping
framework tailored to cloud data centers. By dynamically setting the energy
consumption upper bound, the power load of data centers can be reshaped to
align with the electricity price or other market signals. To this end, we
formulate the power capping problem as a partially observable Markov decision
process. Subsequently, we develop an uncertainty-aware model-based
reinforcement learning (MBRL) method to perceive the cloud data center
operational environment and optimize power-capping decisions. By incorporating
a two-stage uncertainty-aware optimization algorithm into the MBRL, we improve
its adaptability to the ever-changing environment. Additionally, we derive the
optimality gap of the proposed scheme under finite iterations, ensuring
effective decisions under complex and uncertain scenarios. The numerical
experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a cloud
data center operational environment simulator built on real-world production
traces from Alibaba, which demonstrates its potential as an efficient energy
management solution for cloud data centers.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-26 21:39:01</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We introduce Massively Multi-Task Model-Based Policy Optimization (M3PO), a
scalable model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework designed to
address sample inefficiency in single-task settings and poor generalization in
multi-task domains. Existing model-based approaches like DreamerV3 rely on
pixel-level generative models that neglect control-centric representations,
while model-free methods such as PPO suffer from high sample complexity and
weak exploration. M3PO integrates an implicit world model, trained to predict
task outcomes without observation reconstruction, with a hybrid exploration
strategy that combines model-based planning and model-free uncertainty-driven
bonuses. This eliminates the bias-variance trade-off in prior methods by using
discrepancies between model-based and model-free value estimates to guide
exploration, while maintaining stable policy updates through a trust-region
optimizer. M3PO provides an efficient and robust alternative to existing
model-based policy optimization approaches and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks.</p>
