<p class='card-text'>Active vision, also known as active perception, refers to the process of
actively selecting where and how to look in order to gather task-relevant
information. It is a critical component of efficient perception and
decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and
decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention.
However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence,
there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn
active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic
definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the
recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a
special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search
efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose
ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on
top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We
further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across
both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding,
and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote
sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive
segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot
reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit
reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and
evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in
MLLMs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We introduce $\texttt{mosca}$, a $\texttt{Mathematica}$ package designed to
facilitate on-shell calculations in effective field theories (EFTs). This
initial release focuses on the reduction of Green's bases to physical bases, as
well as transformations between arbitrary operator bases. The core of the
package is based on a diagrammatic on-shell matching procedure, grounded in the
equivalence of physical observables derived from both redundant and
non-redundant Lagrangians. $\texttt{mosca}$ offers a complete set of tools for
performing basis transformations, diagram isomorphism detection, numerical
substitution of kinematic configurations, and symbolic manipulation of
algebraic expressions. Planned future developments include extension to
one-loop computations, thus providing support for EFT renormalization directly
in a physical basis and automated computation of one-loop finite matching,
including contributions from evanescent operators. The package, along with

robotic positioners to place fibers feeding optical and infrared spectrographs
across a wide field. SDSS-V uses this system to observe targets throughout the
year at two observatories in support of the science goals of its Milky Way
Mapper and Black Hole Mapper programs. These science goals require observations
of objects over time with preferred temporal spacinges (referred to as
"cadences"), which can differ from object to object even in the same area of
sky. robostrategy is the software we use to construct our planned observations
so that they can best achieve the desired goals given the time available as a
function of sky brightness and local sidereal time, and to assign fibers to
targets during specific observations. We use linear programming techniques to
seek optimal allocations of time under the constraints given. We present the

  Planning</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-27 13:16:03</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Many motion planning algorithms for automated driving require estimating the
probability of collision (POC) to account for uncertainties in the measurement
and estimation of the motion of road users. Common POC estimation techniques
often utilize sampling-based methods that suffer from computational
inefficiency and a non-deterministic estimation, i.e., each estimation result
for the same inputs is slightly different. In contrast, optimization-based
motion planning algorithms require computationally efficient POC estimation,
ideally using deterministic estimation, such that typical optimization
algorithms for motion planning retain feasibility. Estimating the POC
analytically, however, is challenging because it depends on understanding the
collision conditions (e.g., vehicle's shape) and characterizing the uncertainty
in motion prediction. In this paper, we propose an approach in which we
estimate the POC between two vehicles by over-approximating their shapes by a
multi-circular shape approximation. The position and heading of the predicted
vehicle are modelled as random variables, contrasting with the literature,
where the heading angle is often neglected. We guarantee that the provided POC
is an over-approximation, which is essential in providing safety guarantees,
and present a computationally efficient algorithm for computing the POC
estimate for Gaussian uncertainty in the position and heading. This algorithm
is then used in a path-following stochastic model predictive controller (SMPC)
for motion planning. With the proposed algorithm, the SMPC generates
reproducible trajectories while the controller retains its feasibility in the
presented test cases and demonstrates the ability to handle varying levels of
uncertainty.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The Generalized Independent Set (GIS) problem extends the classical maximum
independent set problem by incorporating profits for vertices and penalties for
edges. This generalized problem has been identified in diverse applications in
fields such as forest harvest planning, competitive facility location, social
network analysis, and even machine learning. However, solving the GIS problem
in large-scale, real-world networks remains computationally challenging. In
this paper, we explore data reduction techniques to address this challenge. We
first propose 14 reduction rules that can reduce the input graph with rigorous
optimality guarantees. We then present a reduction-driven local search (RLS)
algorithm that integrates these reduction rules into the pre-processing, the
initial solution generation, and the local search components in a
computationally efficient way. The RLS is empirically evaluated on 278 graphs
arising from different application scenarios. The results indicates that the
RLS is highly competitive -- For most graphs, it achieves significantly
superior solutions compared to other known solvers, and it effectively provides
solutions for graphs exceeding 260 million edges, a task at which every other
known method fails. Analysis also reveals that the data reduction plays a key
role in achieving such a competitive performance.</p>

interesting and safety-critical scenarios from uncurated driving logs remains a
significant challenge. Traditional scenario mining techniques are error-prone
and prohibitively time-consuming, often relying on hand-crafted structured
queries. In this work, we revisit spatio-temporal scenario mining through the
lens of recent vision-language models (VLMs) to detect whether a described
scenario occurs in a driving log and, if so, precisely localize it in both time

interactions relevant to motion planning derived from 1000 driving logs in the
Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset. We evaluate several referential multi-object

development. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages an
FM-powered multi-agent system called AlignMind to address this issue. By having
a cognitive architecture that enhances FMs with Theory-of-Mind capabilities,
our approach considers the mental states and perspectives of software makers.
This allows our solution to iteratively clarify the beliefs, desires, and
intentions of stakeholders, translating these into a set of refined
requirements and a corresponding actionable natural language workflow in the
often-overlooked requirements refinement phase of software engineering, which
is crucial after initial elicitation. Through a multifaceted evaluation

<p class='card-text'>BESIII (BEijing Spectrometer III) is a particle physics experiment with a
vast physics program centered around the study of charmonium and the $\tau$
lepton. The performance of the spectrometer's inner tracker, the innermost part
of a large drift chamber, has been degrading due to aging phenomena related to
the large particle rate. Planned upgrades to the BEPCII (Beijing Electron
Positron Collider II) collider, servicing the experiment, may further aggravate
the problem, with the risk of disrupting the data taking. The Italian component
of the BESIII collaboration proposed a detector based on cylindrical GEM (Gas
Electron Multiplier) technology to replace the aging inner tracker. The new
detector aims to improve the current tracker's spatial resolution in the beam
direction at least a factor 2 and to ensure the continuation of BESIII's data
taking until its end in 2030. After more than 10 years of design, development,
and construction the three layers of the CGEM-IT (Cylindrical GEM Inner
Tracker) are finally being installed in the spectrometer. This thesis describes
the three final years of the detector's development, which led from diagnosing
and resolving mechanical issues preventing the largest layer from powering on
to securing the approval of the experiment's internal review committee for
installation. Particular focus is given to the technological solutions adopted
to overcome the challenges encountered during the development process, which
often required a complete rethinking of previous methods and procedures. The
thesis concludes with a snapshot of the ongoing installation of the detector,
commenting on the results of the preparatory work undertaken to ensure its

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-27 09:19:58</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of human mobility is crucial for
addressing societal challenges, such as epidemic control and urban
transportation optimization. Despite advancements in data collection, the
complexity and scale of mobility data continue to pose significant analytical
challenges. Existing methods often result in losing location-specific details
and fail to fully capture the intricacies of human movement. This study
proposes a two-step dimensionality reduction framework to overcome existing
limitations. First, we construct a potential landscape of human flow from
origin-destination (OD) matrices using combinatorial Hodge theory, preserving
essential spatial and structural information while enabling an intuitive
visualization of flow patterns. Second, we apply principal component analysis
(PCA) to the potential landscape, systematically identifying major
spatiotemporal patterns. By implementing this two-step reduction method, we
reveal significant shifts during a pandemic, characterized by an overall
declines in mobility and stark contrasts between weekdays and holidays. These
findings underscore the effectiveness of our framework in uncovering complex
mobility patterns and provide valuable insights into urban planning and public

<p class='card-text'>An unmanned deformable vehicle is a wheel-legged robot transforming between
two configurations: vehicular and humanoid states, with different motion modes

configurations, a center-of-mass adjustment mechanism was designed. Further, a
motion stability hierarchical control algorithm was proposed, and an
electromechanical model based on a two-degree-of-freedom center-of-mass

by sharing perception and driving intention. Cooperative maneuver planning uses
connectivity to enhance traffic efficiency, which has, so far, been mainly
considered for automated intersection management. In this article, we present a

other vehicles at any distribution. Our solution is based on an optimization
approach accompanied by an efficient heuristic method for high-load scenarios.
We extensively evaluate the proposed planer in a distinctly realistic

<p class='card-text'>Generating long videos that can show complex stories, like movie scenes from
scripts, has great promise and offers much more than short clips. However,
current methods that use autoregression with diffusion models often struggle
because their step-by-step process naturally leads to a serious error
accumulation (drift). Also, many existing ways to make long videos focus on
single, continuous scenes, making them less useful for stories with many events
and changes. This paper introduces a new approach to solve these problems.
First, we propose a novel way to annotate datasets at the frame-level,
providing detailed text guidance needed for making complex, multi-scene long
videos. This detailed guidance works with a Frame-Level Attention Mechanism to
make sure text and video match precisely. A key feature is that each part
(frame) within these windows can be guided by its own distinct text prompt. Our
training uses Diffusion Forcing to provide the model with the ability to handle
time flexibly. We tested our approach on difficult VBench 2.0 benchmarks
("Complex Plots" and "Complex Landscapes") based on the WanX2.1-T2V-1.3B model.
The results show our method is better at following instructions in complex,
changing scenes and creates high-quality long videos. We plan to share our
dataset annotation methods and trained models with the research community.

<p class='card-text'>Achieving generalizable and precise robotic manipulation across diverse
environments remains a critical challenge, largely due to limitations in
spatial perception. While prior imitation-learning approaches have made
progress, their reliance on raw RGB inputs and handcrafted features often leads
to overfitting and poor 3D reasoning under varied lighting, occlusion, and
object conditions. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that couples
robust multimodal perception with reliable grasp prediction. Our architecture
fuses domain-randomized augmentation, monocular depth estimation, and a
depth-aware 6-DoF Grasp Prompt into a single spatial representation for
downstream action planning. Conditioned on this encoding and a high-level task
prompt, our diffusion-based policy yields precise action sequences, achieving
up to 40% improvement in grasp success and 45% higher task success rates under
environmental variation. These results demonstrate that spatially grounded

<p class='card-text'>Despite hundreds of papers on preconditioned linear systems of equations,
there remains a significant lack of comprehensive performance benchmarks
comparing various preconditioners for solving symmetric positive definite (SPD)
systems. In this paper, we present a comparative study of 79 matrices using a
broad range of preconditioners. Specifically, we evaluate 10 widely used
preconditoners across 108 configurations to assess their relative performance
against using no preconditioner. Our focus is on preconditioners that are
commonly used in practice, are available in major software packages, and can be
utilized as black-box tools without requiring significant \textit{a priori}
knowledge. In addition, we compare these against a selection of classical
methods. We primarily compare them without regards to effort needed to compute
the preconditioner. Our results show that symmetric positive definite systems
are mostly likely to benefit from incomplete symmetric factorizations, such as
incomplete Cholesky (IC). Multigrid methods occasionally do exceptionally well.
Simple classical techniques, symmetric Gauss Seidel and symmetric SOR, are not
productive. We find that including preconditioner construction costs
significantly diminishes the advantages of iterative methods compared to direct
solvers; although, tuned IC methods often still outperform direct methods.
Additionally, ordering strategies such as approximate minimum degree
significantly enhance IC effectiveness. We plan to expand the benchmark with
larger matrices, additional solvers, and detailed metrics to provide actionable

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous driving requires real-time, robust reasoning across perception,
prediction, planning, and behavior. However, conventional end-to-end models
fail to generalize in complex scenarios due to the lack of structured
reasoning. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have been applied to driving
tasks, but they typically rely on isolated modules and static supervision,
limiting their ability to support multi-stage decision-making. We present
AutoDriveRL, a unified training framework that formulates autonomous driving as
a structured reasoning process over four core tasks. Each task is independently
modeled as a vision-language question-answering problem and optimized using
task-specific reward models, enabling fine-grained reinforcement signals at
different reasoning stages. Within this framework, we train DriveRX, a
cross-task reasoning VLM designed for real-time decision-making. DriveRX
achieves strong performance on a public benchmark, outperforming GPT-4o in

<p class='card-text'>Analysing and modeling urban individual tour behavior are of great
significance for a wide range of applications such as transportation management
and urban planning. However, the urban tour length distribution has long been
neglected in individual mobility models that can be found in recent literature.
To fill in this gap, we analyse Foursquare user check-in data and find that
urban human tour length distribution follows a power-law with exponential
truncation. This law also appears in China's urban heavy truck trajectory data
which can reflect commercial vehicle mobility. To reproduce the universal
scaling law on tours of urban human and truck mobility, we introduce a tour
terminate-continue model. Our model can not only reproduce the urban tour
length distribution, but also the Heaps' law and Zipf's law in human and truck
mobility, providing a new perspective for characterizing individual human
mobility.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Clear communication of robot intent fosters transparency and interpretability
in physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), particularly during assistive tasks
involving direct human-robot contact. We introduce CoRI, a pipeline that
automatically generates natural language communication of a robot's upcoming
actions directly from its motion plan and visual perception. Our pipeline first
processes the robot's image view to identify human poses and key environmental
features. It then encodes the planned 3D spatial trajectory (including velocity
and force) onto this view, visually grounding the path and its dynamics. CoRI
queries a vision-language model with this visual representation to interpret
the planned action within the visual context before generating concise,
user-directed statements, without relying on task-specific information. Results
from a user study involving robot-assisted feeding, bathing, and shaving tasks
across two different robots indicate that CoRI leads to statistically
significant difference in communication clarity compared to a baseline
communication strategy. Specifically, CoRI effectively conveys not only the
robot's high-level intentions but also crucial details about its motion and any
collaborative user action needed.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-26 18:47:50</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Accurate prediction of blast pressure fields is essential for applications in
structural safety, defense planning, and hazard mitigation. Traditional methods
such as empirical models and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations
offer limited trade offs between speed and accuracy; empirical models fail to
capture complex interactions in cluttered environments, while CFD simulations
are computationally expensive and time consuming. In this work, we introduce
BlastOFormer, a novel Transformer based surrogate model for full field maximum
pressure prediction from arbitrary obstacle and charge configurations.
BlastOFormer leverages a signed distance function (SDF) encoding and a grid to
grid attention based architecture inspired by OFormer and Vision Transformer
(ViT) frameworks. Trained on a dataset generated using the open source
blastFoam CFD solver, our model outperforms convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) across both log transformed and
unscaled domains. Quantitatively, BlastOFormer achieves the highest R2 score
(0.9516) and lowest error metrics, while requiring only 6.4 milliseconds for
inference, more than 600,000 times faster than CFD simulations. Qualitative
visualizations and error analyses further confirm BlastOFormer's superior
spatial coherence and generalization capabilities. These results highlight its
potential as a real time alternative to conventional CFD approaches for blast
pressure estimation in complex environments.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-26 17:10:43</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Existing Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems primarily focus on
single-session dialogues, limiting their effectiveness in long-term memory
augmentation. To address this challenge, we introduce a MS-TOD dataset, the
first multi-session TOD dataset designed to retain long-term memory across
sessions, enabling fewer turns and more efficient task completion. This defines
a new benchmark task for evaluating long-term memory in multi-session TOD.
Based on this new dataset, we propose a Memory-Active Policy (MAP) that
improves multi-session dialogue efficiency through a two-stage approach. 1)
Memory-Guided Dialogue Planning retrieves intent-aligned history, identifies
key QA units via a memory judger, refines them by removing redundant questions,
and generates responses based on the reconstructed memory. 2) Proactive
Response Strategy detects and correct errors or omissions, ensuring efficient
and accurate task completion. We evaluate MAP on MS-TOD dataset, focusing on
response quality and effectiveness of the proactive strategy. Experiments on
MS-TOD demonstrate that MAP significantly improves task success and turn
efficiency in multi-session scenarios, while maintaining competitive
performance on conventional single-session tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The increasing deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other
autonomous algorithmic systems presents the world with new systemic risks.
While focus often lies on the function of individual algorithms, a critical and
underestimated danger arises from their interactions, particularly when
algorithmic systems operate without awareness of each other, or when those
deploying them are unaware of the full algorithmic ecosystem deployment is
occurring in. These interactions can lead to unforeseen, rapidly escalating
negative outcomes - from market crashes and energy supply disruptions to
potential physical accidents and erosion of public trust - often exceeding the
human capacity for effective monitoring and the legal capacities for proper
intervention. Current governance frameworks are inadequate as they lack
visibility into this complex ecosystem of interactions. This paper outlines the
nature of this challenge and proposes some initial policy suggestions centered
on increasing transparency and accountability through phased system

<p class='card-text'>Collision-free motion planning for redundant robot manipulators in complex
environments is yet to be explored. Although recent advancements at the
intersection of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and robotics have highlighted
its potential to handle versatile robotic tasks, current DRL-based
collision-free motion planners for manipulators are highly costly, hindering
their deployment and application. This is due to an overreliance on the minimum
distance between the manipulator and obstacles, inadequate exploration and
decision-making by DRL, and inefficient data acquisition and utilization. In
this article, we propose URPlanner, a universal paradigm for collision-free
robotic motion planning based on DRL. URPlanner offers several advantages over
existing approaches: it is platform-agnostic, cost-effective in both training
and deployment, and applicable to arbitrary manipulators without solving
inverse kinematics. To achieve this, we first develop a parameterized task
space and a universal obstacle avoidance reward that is independent of minimum
distance. Second, we introduce an augmented policy exploration and evaluation
algorithm that can be applied to various DRL algorithms to enhance their
performance. Third, we propose an expert data diffusion strategy for efficient
policy learning, which can produce a large-scale trajectory dataset from only a
few expert demonstrations. Finally, the superiority of the proposed methods is
comprehensively verified through experiments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Spatial Planning is a crucial part in the field of spatial intelligence,
which requires the understanding and planning about object arrangements in
space perspective. AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt
to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic
assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct
benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial
reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers
from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task
execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive
benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability
of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild
requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on
the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial
planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data
collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates
spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial
understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on
MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based
agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their
spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues
for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development
for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-26 15:28:17</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by
vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate
structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains
their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive
simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that
enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by
injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal
input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that
provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud
capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich
spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints.
Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware
working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities
with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on
this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which
the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline
features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment
setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene
hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and
challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior
work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs
to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path
planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in
computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper employs a game-theoretic approach to analyze investment decisions
in Ireland's electricity market. It compares optimal electricity investment
strategies among energy generators under a perfect competition framework with
an imperfect Nash-Cournot competition. The model incorporates market price
based on competition among generators while accounting for the supply capacity
of each firm and each technology, along with the System Non-Synchronous
Penetration (SNSP) constraint to reflect operational limitations in renewable
energy contribution to the power system. Both models are formulated as
single-objective function optimization problems. Furthermore, unit commitment
constraints are introduced to the perfect competition model, allowing the model
to incorporate binary decision variables to capture energy unit scheduling
decisions of online status, startup, and shutdown costs. The proposed models
are evaluated under three different demand test cases, using Ireland's
electricity generation projections for 2023 to 2033. The results highlight key
differences in investment decisions, carbon emissions, and the contribution of
renewable technologies in perfect and imperfect competition structures. The
findings provide managerial insights for policymakers and stakeholders,

<p class='card-text'>Due to the powerful vision-language reasoning and generalization abilities,
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention in
the field of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, their application to
closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have

this work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed

<p class='card-text'>Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as the urban heat island
effect and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to
distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale
quantities (e.g., total population or area). However, these approaches suffer
from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect
intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here we use high-resolution
data of urban temperatures, air quality, population counts, and street
intersections from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint
probability distributions follow universal scaling functions. By using a
logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we
show that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the
entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within
and across cities. We further demonstrate that traditional models linking
climate variables to the distance from the city center fail to reproduce the
observed distributions unless the stochasticity of urban structure is fully

<p class='card-text'>Recent progress in strengthening the capabilities of large language models
has stemmed from applying reinforcement learning to domains with automatically
verifiable outcomes. A key question is whether we can similarly use RL to
optimize for outcomes in domains where evaluating outcomes inherently requires
human feedback; for example, in tasks like deep research and trip planning,
outcome evaluation is qualitative and there are many possible degrees of
success. One attractive and scalable modality for collecting human feedback is
preference data: ordinal rankings (pairwise or $k$-wise) that indicate, for $k$
given outcomes, which one is preferred. In this work, we study a critical
roadblock: preference data fundamentally and significantly limits outcome-based
optimization. Even with idealized preference data (infinite, noiseless, and
online), the use of ordinal feedback can prevent obtaining even approximately
optimal solutions. We formalize this impossibility using voting theory, drawing
an analogy between how a model chooses to answer a query with how voters choose
a candidate to elect. This indicates that grounded human scoring and
algorithmic innovations are necessary for extending the success of RL
post-training to domains demanding human feedback. We also explore why these
limitations have disproportionately impacted RLHF when it comes to eliciting
reasoning behaviors (e.g., backtracking) versus situations where RLHF has been
historically successful (e.g., instruction-tuning and safety training), finding
that the limitations of preference data primarily suppress RLHF's ability to
elicit robust strategies -- a class that encompasses most reasoning behaviors.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-26 11:50:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>With the recent success of world-model agents, which extend the core idea of
model-based reinforcement learning by learning a differentiable model for
sample-efficient control across diverse tasks, active inference (AIF) offers a
complementary, neuroscience-grounded paradigm that unifies perception,
learning, and action within a single probabilistic framework powered by a
generative model. Despite this promise, practical AIF agents still rely on
accurate immediate predictions and exhaustive planning, a limitation that is
exacerbated in delayed environments requiring plans over long horizons, tens to
hundreds of steps. Moreover, most existing agents are evaluated on robotic or
vision benchmarks which, while natural for biological agents, fall short of
real-world industrial complexity. We address these limitations with a
generative-policy architecture featuring (i) a multi-step latent transition
that lets the generative model predict an entire horizon in a single
look-ahead, (ii) an integrated policy network that enables the transition and
receives gradients of the expected free energy, (iii) an alternating
optimization scheme that updates model and policy from a replay buffer, and
(iv) a single gradient step that plans over long horizons, eliminating
exhaustive planning from the control loop. We evaluate our agent in an
environment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario with delayed and
long-horizon settings. The empirical results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, demonstrating the coupled world-model with the AIF formalism
yields an end-to-end probabilistic controller capable of effective decision
making in delayed, long-horizon settings without handcrafted rewards or
expensive planning.</p>
