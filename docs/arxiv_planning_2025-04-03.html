  Estimation via Gaussian Splatting</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Shu-Wei Lu, Yi-Hsuan Tsai, Yi-Ting Chen</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-02 17:59:38</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Bird's-eye view (BEV) perception has gained significant attention because it
provides a unified representation to fuse multiple view images and enables a
wide range of down-stream autonomous driving tasks, such as forecasting and
planning. Recent state-of-the-art models utilize projection-based methods which
formulate BEV perception as query learning to bypass explicit depth estimation.
While we observe promising advancements in this paradigm, they still fall short
of real-world applications because of the lack of uncertainty modeling and
expensive computational requirement. In this work, we introduce GaussianLSS, a
novel uncertainty-aware BEV perception framework that revisits
unprojection-based methods, specifically the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) paradigm,
and enhances them with depth un-certainty modeling. GaussianLSS represents
spatial dispersion by learning a soft depth mean and computing the variance of
the depth distribution, which implicitly captures object extents. We then
transform the depth distribution into 3D Gaussians and rasterize them to
construct uncertainty-aware BEV features. We evaluate GaussianLSS on the
nuScenes dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to
unprojection-based methods. In particular, it provides significant advantages
in speed, running 2.5x faster, and in memory efficiency, using 0.3x less memory
compared to projection-based methods, while achieving competitive performance
with only a 0.4% IoU difference.</p>

  Fiber Trajectories in Cardiac Diffusion Tensor Imaging</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Mohini Anand, Xavier Tricoche</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-02 17:56:57</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Understanding the complex myocardial architecture is critical for diagnosing
and treating heart disease. However, existing methods often struggle to
accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)
data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous,
intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning
framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a
data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine
a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential
information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape
features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context.
Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33
to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber
trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new,
flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a
level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved,
with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing
disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac
care.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-02 17:47:23</h6>
<p class='card-text'>End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable progress by integrating
perception, prediction, and planning into a fully differentiable framework.
Yet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation
is indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a
given trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal
can be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics
and predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving
framework WoTE, which leverages a BEV World model to predict future BEV states
for Trajectory Evaluation. The proposed BEV world model is latency-efficient
compared to image-level world models and can be seamlessly supervised using
off-the-shelf BEV-space traffic simulators. We validate our framework on both
the NAVSIM benchmark and the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark based on the
CARLA simulator, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is released at
https://github.com/liyingyanUCAS/WoTE.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-02 16:02:43</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Trajectory prediction of other vehicles is crucial for autonomous vehicles,
with applications from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. Typically,
target trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles
exhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in
thermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised
Machine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of
targets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts
the distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and
parameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using
a time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed
virtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only
training data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in
replacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path
planning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for
aerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic
predictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms
for autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Motion planning in uncertain environments like complex urban areas is a key
challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The aim of our research is to
investigate how AVs can navigate crowded, unpredictable scenarios with multiple
pedestrians while maintaining a safe and efficient vehicle behavior. So far,
most research has concentrated on static or deterministic traffic participant
behavior. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for motion planning in
crowded spaces by combining social force principles for simulating realistic
pedestrian behavior with a risk-aware motion planner. We evaluate this new
algorithm in a 2D simulation environment to rigorously assess AV-pedestrian
interactions, demonstrating that our algorithm enables safe, efficient, and
adaptive motion planning, particularly in highly crowded urban environments - a
first in achieving this level of performance. This study has not taken into
consideration real-time constraints and has been shown only in simulation so
far. Further studies are needed to investigate the novel algorithm in a
complete software stack for AVs on real cars to investigate the entire
perception, planning and control pipeline in crowded scenarios. We release the
code developed in this research as an open-source resource for further studies

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must navigate dynamic urban environments where
occlusions and perception limitations introduce significant uncertainties. This
research builds upon and extends existing approaches in risk-aware motion
planning and occlusion tracking to address these challenges. While prior
studies have developed individual methods for occlusion tracking and risk
assessment, a comprehensive method integrating these techniques has not been
fully explored. We, therefore, enhance a phantom agent-centric model by
incorporating sequential reasoning to track occluded areas and predict
potential hazards. Our model enables realistic scenario representation and
context-aware risk evaluation by modeling diverse phantom agents, each with
distinct behavior profiles. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach
improves situational awareness and balances proactive safety with efficient
traffic flow. While these results underline the potential of our method,
validation in real-world scenarios is necessary to confirm its feasibility and
generalizability. By utilizing and advancing established methodologies, this
work contributes to safer and more reliable AV planning in complex urban

hanging below them and passing through or around obstacles. A novel composition
mechanism is proposed, which simplifies the degrees of freedom of the combined
aerial system and expresses the corresponding states in a compact form. Given
the state of the composition, a dynamic body is generated that encapsulates the
quadrotors-rope system and makes the procedure of collision checking between
the system and the environment more efficient. By utilizing the above two
abstractions, an RRT path planning scheme is implemented and a collision-free
path for the formation is generated. This path is decomposed back to the
quadrotors' desired positions that are fed to the Model Predictive Controller
(MPC) for each one. The efficiency of the proposed framework is experimentally
evaluated.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Computer use agents automate digital tasks by directly interacting with
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on computers and mobile devices, offering
significant potential to enhance human productivity by completing an open-ended
space of user queries. However, current agents face significant challenges:
imprecise grounding of GUI elements, difficulties with long-horizon task
planning, and performance bottlenecks from relying on single generalist models
for diverse cognitive tasks. To this end, we introduce Agent S2, a novel
compositional framework that delegates cognitive responsibilities across
various generalist and specialist models. We propose a novel
Mixture-of-Grounding technique to achieve precise GUI localization and
introduce Proactive Hierarchical Planning, dynamically refining action plans at
multiple temporal scales in response to evolving observations. Evaluations
demonstrate that Agent S2 establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on three prominent computer use benchmarks. Specifically, Agent S2 achieves
18.9% and 32.7% relative improvements over leading baseline agents such as
Claude Computer Use and UI-TARS on the OSWorld 15-step and 50-step evaluation.
Moreover, Agent S2 generalizes effectively to other operating systems and
applications, surpassing previous best methods by 52.8% on WindowsAgentArena
and by 16.52% on AndroidWorld relatively. Code available at

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-01 13:26:28</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This study focuses on Embodied Complex-Question Answering task, which means
the embodied robot need to understand human questions with intricate structures
and abstract semantics. The core of this task lies in making appropriate plans
based on the perception of the visual environment. Existing methods often
generate plans in a once-for-all manner, i.e., one-step planning. Such approach
rely on large models, without sufficient understanding of the environment.
Considering multi-step planning, the framework for formulating plans in a
sequential manner is proposed in this paper. To ensure the ability of our
framework to tackle complex questions, we create a structured semantic space,
where hierarchical visual perception and chain expression of the question
essence can achieve iterative interaction. This space makes sequential task
planning possible. Within the framework, we first parse human natural language
based on a visual hierarchical scene graph, which can clarify the intention of
the question. Then, we incorporate external rules to make a plan for current
step, weakening the reliance on large models. Every plan is generated based on
feedback from visual perception, with multiple rounds of interaction until an
answer is obtained. This approach enables continuous feedback and adjustment,
allowing the robot to optimize its action strategy. To test our framework, we
contribute a new dataset with more complex questions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach performs excellently and stably on complex tasks.
And also, the feasibility of our approach in real-world scenarios has been
established, indicating its practical applicability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reconstructing and decomposing dynamic urban scenes is crucial for autonomous
driving, urban planning, and scene editing. However, existing methods fail to
perform instance-aware decomposition without manual annotations, which is
crucial for instance-level scene editing.We propose UnIRe, a 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) based approach that decomposes a scene into a static
background and individual dynamic instances using only RGB images and LiDAR
point clouds. At its core, we introduce 4D superpoints, a novel representation
that clusters multi-frame LiDAR points in 4D space, enabling unsupervised
instance separation based on spatiotemporal correlations. These 4D superpoints
serve as the foundation for our decomposed 4D initialization, i.e., providing
spatial and temporal initialization to train a dynamic 3DGS for arbitrary
dynamic classes without requiring bounding boxes or object
templates.Furthermore, we introduce a smoothness regularization strategy in
both 2D and 3D space, further improving the temporal stability.Experiments on
benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods in
decomposed dynamic scene reconstruction while enabling accurate and flexible
instance-level editing, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Collision avoidance capability is an essential component in an autonomous
vessel navigation system. To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic
obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction
face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the
intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating
the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the
own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in
this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel
intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different
interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its
inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this
model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating
considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The
proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from
historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-01 12:00:37</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted communication is a revolutionary
technology that has been recently presented as a potential candidate for beyond
fifth-generation millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Although mmWaves can
offer a notably high data rate, their high penetration and propagation losses
mean that line of sight (LoS) is necessary for effective communication. Due to
the presence of obstacles and user mobility, UAV trajectory planning plays a
crucial role in improving system performance. In this work, we propose a novel
computational geometry-based trajectory planning scheme by considering the user
mobility, the priority of the delay sensitive ultra-reliable low-latency
communications (URLLC) and the high throughput requirements of the enhanced
mobile broadband (eMBB) traffic. Specifically, we use geometric tools like
Apollonius circle and minimum enclosing ball of balls to find the optimal
position of the UAV that supports uninterrupted connections to the URLLC users
and maximizes the aggregate throughput of the eMBB users. Finally, the
numerical results demonstrate the benefits of the suggested approach over an
existing state of the art benchmark scheme in terms of sum throughput obtained
by URLLC and eMBB users.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Clifford circuit optimization is an important step in the quantum compilation
pipeline. Major compilers employ heuristic approaches. While they are fast,
their results are often suboptimal. Minimization of noisy gates, like 2-qubit
CNOT gates, is crucial for practical computing. Exact approaches have been
proposed to fill the gap left by heuristic approaches. Among these are SAT
based approaches that optimize gate count or depth, but they suffer from
scalability issues. Further, they do not guarantee optimality on more important
metrics like CNOT count or CNOT depth. A recent work proposed an exhaustive
search only on Clifford circuits in a certain normal form to guarantee CNOT
count optimality. But an exhaustive approach cannot scale beyond 6 qubits.
  In this paper, we incorporate search restricted to Clifford normal forms in a
SAT encoding to guarantee CNOT count optimality. By allowing parallel plans, we
propose a second SAT encoding that optimizes CNOT depth. By taking advantage of
flexibility in SAT based approaches, we also handle connectivity restrictions
in hardware platforms, and allow for qubit relabeling. We have implemented the
above encodings and variations in our open source tool Q-Synth.
  In experiments, our encodings significantly outperform existing SAT
approaches on random Clifford circuits. We consider practical VQE and Feynman
benchmarks to compare with TKET and Qiskit compilers. In all-to-all
connectivity, we observe reductions up to 32.1% in CNOT count and 48.1% in CNOT
depth. Overall, we observe better results than TKET in the CNOT count and
depth. We also experiment with connectivity restrictions of major quantum
platforms. Compared to Qiskit, we observe up to 30.3% CNOT count and 35.9% CNOT
depth further reduction.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Mobile robot navigation systems are increasingly relied upon in dynamic and
complex environments, yet they often struggle with map inaccuracies and the
resulting inefficient path planning. This paper presents MRHaD, a Mixed
Reality-based Hand-drawn Map Editing Interface that enables intuitive,
real-time map modifications through natural hand gestures. By integrating the
MR head-mounted display with the robotic navigation system, operators can
directly create hand-drawn restricted zones (HRZ), thereby bridging the gap
between 2D map representations and the real-world environment. Comparative
experiments against conventional 2D editing methods demonstrate that MRHaD
significantly improves editing efficiency, map accuracy, and overall usability,
contributing to safer and more efficient mobile robot operations. The proposed
approach provides a robust technical foundation for advancing human-robot
collaboration and establishing innovative interaction models that enhance the

<p class='card-text'>The Advanced Wakefield Experiment, AWAKE, is a well-established international
collaboration and aims to develop the proton-driven plasma wakefield
acceleration of electron bunches to energies and qualities suitable for first
particle physics applications, such as strong-field QED and fixed target
experiments ($\sim$50-200GeV). Numerical simulations show that these energies
can be reached with an average accelerating gradient of $\sim1$GeV/m in a
single proton-driven plasma wakefield stage. This is enabled by the high energy
per particle and per bunch of the CERN SPS 19kJ, 400GeV and LHC ($\sim$120kJ,
7TeV) proton bunches. Bunches produced by synchrotrons are long, and AWAKE
takes advantage of the self-modulation process to drive wakefields with GV/m
amplitude. By the end of 2025, all physics concepts related to self-modulation
will have been experimentally established as part of the AWAKE ongoing program
that started in 2016. Key achievements include: direct observation of
self-modulation, stabilization and control by two seeding methods, acceleration
of externally injected electrons from 19MeV to more than 2GeV, and sustained
high wakefield amplitudes beyond self-modulation saturation using a plasma
density step. In addition to a brief summary of achievements reached so far,
this document outlines the AWAKE roadmap as a demonstrator facility for
producing beams with quality sufficient for first applications. The plan
includes: 1) Accelerating a quality-controlled electron bunch to multi-GeV
energies in a 10m plasma by 2031; 2) Demonstrating scalability to even higher
energies by LS4. Synergies of the R&D performed in AWAKE that are relevant for
advancing plasma wakefield acceleration in general are highlighted. We argue
that AWAKE and similar advanced accelerator R&D be strongly supported by the
European Strategy for Particle Physics Update.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-01 04:34:37</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Many robotics tasks, such as path planning or trajectory optimization, are
formulated as optimal control problems (OCPs). The key to obtaining high
performance lies in the design of the OCP's objective function. In practice,
the objective function consists of a set of individual components that must be
carefully modeled and traded off such that the OCP has the desired solution. It
is often challenging to balance multiple components to achieve the desired
solution and to understand, when the solution is undesired, the impact of
individual cost components. In this paper, we present a framework addressing
these challenges based on the concept of directional corrections. Specifically,
given the solution to an OCP that is deemed undesirable, and access to an
expert providing the direction of change that would increase the desirability
of the solution, our method analyzes the individual cost components for their
"consistency" with the provided directional correction. This information can be
used to improve the OCP formulation, e.g., by increasing the weight of
consistent cost components, or reducing the weight of - or even redesigning -
inconsistent cost components. We also show that our framework can automatically
tune parameters of the OCP to achieve consistency with a set of corrections.</p>

guarantees and empirical performance relative to uniform subsampling. We
provide, in a first of its kind in compressed sensing, theoretical guarantees

increasing number of measurements for optimized sampling schemes, assuming that
the noise is Gaussian. We moreover provide similar guarantees for measurements
sampled with-replacement with arbitrary probability weights. All our results

<p class='card-text'>Hot exozodiacal dust is dust in the innermost regions of planetary systems,
at temperatures around 1000K to 2000K, and commonly detected by near-infrared
interferometry. The phenomenon is poorly understood and has received renewed
attention as a potential risk to a planned future space mission to image
potentially habitable exoplanets and characterize their atmospheres (exo-Earth
imaging) such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). In this article, we
review the current understanding of hot exozodiacal dust and its implications
for HWO. We argue that the observational evidence suggests that the phenomenon
is most likely real and indeed caused by hot dust, although conclusive proof in
particular of the latter statement is still missing. Furthermore, we find that
there exists as of yet no single model that is able to successfully explain the
presence of the dust. We find that it is plausible and not unlikely that large
amounts of hot exozodiacal dust in a system will critically limit the
sensitivity of exo-Earth imaging observations around that star. It is thus
crucial to better understood the phenomenon in order to be able to evaluate the
actual impact on such a mission, and current and near-future observational
opportunities for acquiring the required data exist. At the same time, hot
exozodiacal dust (and warm exozodiacal dust closer to a system's habitable
zone) has the potential to provide important context for HWO observations of
rocky, HZ planets, constraining the environment in which these planets exist
and hence to determine why a detected planet may be capable to sustain life or
not.</p>
