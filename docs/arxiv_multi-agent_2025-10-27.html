  Edge Internet of Things</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices continuously grows and
application scenarios constantly enrich, the volume of sensor data experiences
an explosive increase. However, substantial data demands considerable energy
during computation and transmission. Redundant deployment or mobile assistance
is essential to cover the target area reliably with fault-prone sensors.
Consequently, the ``butterfly effect" may appear during the IoT operation,
since unreasonable data overlap could result in many duplicate data. To this
end, we propose Senses, a novel online energy saving solution for edge IoT
networks, with the insight of sensing and storing less at the network edge by
adopting Muti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Senses achieves data
de-duplication by dynamically adjusting sensor coverage at the sensor level.
For exceptional cases where sensor coverage cannot be altered, Senses conducts
data partitioning and eliminates redundant data at the controller level.
Furthermore, at the global level, considering the heterogeneity of IoT devices,
Senses balances the operational duration among the devices to prolong the
overall operational duration of edge IoT networks. We evaluate the performance
of Senses through testbed experiments and simulations. The results show that
Senses saves 11.37% of energy consumption on control devices and prolongs 20%
overall operational duration of the IoT device network.</p>
