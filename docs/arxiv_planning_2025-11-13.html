<p class='card-text'>Real world applications as in industry and robotics need modelling rich and diverse automated planning problems. Their resolution usually requires coordinated and concurrent action execution. In several cases, these problems are naturally decomposed in a hierarchical way and expressed by a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) formalism.
  HDDL, a hierarchical extension of the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), unlike PDDL 2.1 does not allow to represent planning problems with numerical and temporal constraints, which are essential for real world applications. We propose to fill the gap between HDDL and these operational needs and to extend HDDL by taking inspiration from PDDL 2.1 in order to express numerical and temporal expressions. This paper opens discussions on the semantics and the syntax needed for a future HDDL 2.1 extension.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Many real-world planning domains involve diverse information sources, external entities, and variable-reliability agents, all of which may impact the confidence, risk, and sensitivity of plans. Humans reviewing a plan may lack context about these factors; however, this information is available during the domain generation, which means it can also be interwoven into the planner and its resulting plans. This paper presents a provenance-based approach to explaining automated plans. Our approach (1) extends the SHOP3 HTN planner to generate dependency information, (2) transforms the dependency information into an established PROV-O representation, and (3) uses graph propagation and TMS-inspired algorithms to support dynamic and counter-factual assessment of information flow, confidence, and support. We qualified our approach's explanatory scope with respect to explanation targets from the automated planning literature and the information analysis literature, and we demonstrate its ability to assess a plan's pertinence, sensitivity, risk, assumption support, diversity, and relative confidence.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We present a novel framework for motion planning in dynamic environments that accounts for the predicted trajectories of moving objects in the scene. We explore the use of composite signed-distance fields in motion planning and detail how they can be used to generate signed-distance fields (SDFs) in real-time to incorporate predicted obstacle motions. We benchmark our approach of using composite SDFs against performing exact SDF calculations on the workspace occupancy grid. Our proposed technique generates predictions substantially faster and typically exhibits an 81--97% reduction in time for subsequent predictions. We integrate our framework with GPMP2 to demonstrate a full implementation of our approach in real-time, enabling a 7-DoF Panda arm to smoothly avoid a moving robot.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper aims to improve the path quality and computational efficiency of kinodynamic planners used for vehicular systems. It proposes a learning framework for identifying promising controls during the expansion process of sampling-based motion planners for systems with dynamics. Offline, the learning process is trained to return the highest-quality control that reaches a local goal state (i.e., a waypoint) in the absence of obstacles from an input difference vector between its current state and a local goal state. The data generation scheme provides bounds on the target dispersion and uses state space pruning to ensure high-quality controls. By focusing on the system's dynamics, this process is data efficient and takes place once for a dynamical system, so that it can be used for different environments with modular expansion functions. This work integrates the proposed learning process with a) an exploratory expansion function that generates waypoints with biased coverage over the reachable space, and b) proposes an exploitative expansion function for mobile robots, which generates waypoints using medial axis information. This paper evaluates the learning process and the corresponding planners for a first and second-order differential drive systems. The results show that the proposed integration of learning and planning can produce better quality paths than kinodynamic planning with random controls in fewer iterations and computation time.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Interactive partially observable Markov decision processes (I-POMDP) provide a formal framework for planning for a self-interested agent in multiagent settings. An agent operating in a multiagent environment must deliberate about the actions that other agents may take and the effect these actions have on the environment and the rewards it receives. Traditional I-POMDPs model this dependence on the actions of other agents using joint action and model spaces. Therefore, the solution complexity grows exponentially with the number of agents thereby complicating scalability. In this paper, we model and extend anonymity and context-specific independence -- problem structures often present in agent populations -- for computational gain. We empirically demonstrate the efficiency from exploiting these problem structures by solving a new multiagent problem involving more than 1,000 agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Ontologies are known for their ability to organize rich metadata, support the identification of novel insights via semantic queries, and promote reuse. In this paper, we consider the problem of automated planning, where the objective is to find a sequence of actions that will move an agent from an initial state of the world to a desired goal state. We hypothesize that given a large number of available planners and diverse planning domains; they carry essential information that can be leveraged to identify suitable planners and improve their performance for a domain. We use data on planning domains and planners from the International Planning Competition (IPC) to construct a planning ontology and demonstrate via experiments in two use cases that the ontology can lead to the selection of promising planners and improving their performance using macros - a form of action ordering constraints extracted from planning ontology. We also make the planning ontology and associated resources available to the community to promote further research.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Classical AI planners provide solutions to planning problems in the form of long and opaque text outputs. To aid in the understanding transferability of planning solutions, it is necessary to have a rich and comprehensible representation for both human and computers beyond the current line-by-line text notation. In particular, it is desirable to encode the trace of literals throughout the plan to capture the dependencies between actions selected. The approach of this paper is to view the actions as maps between literals and the selected plan as a composition of those maps. The mathematical theory, called category theory, provides the relevant structures for capturing maps, their compositions, and maps between compositions. We employ this theory to propose an algorithm agnostic, model-based representation for domains, problems, and plans expressed in the commonly used planning description language, PDDL. This category theoretic representation is accompanied by a graphical syntax in addition to a linear notation, similar to algebraic expressions, that can be used to infer literals used at every step of the plan. This provides the appropriate constructive abstraction and facilitates comprehension for human operators. In this paper, we demonstrate this on a plan within the Blocksworld domain.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In this paper we present an interface between a symbolic planner and a geometric task planner, which is different to a standard trajectory planner in that the former is able to perform geometric reasoning on abstract entities---tasks. We believe that this approach facilitates a more principled interface to symbolic planning, while also leaving more room for the geometric planner to make independent decisions. We show how the two planners could be interfaced, and how their planning and backtracking could be interleaved. We also provide insights for a methodology for using the combined system, and experimental results to use as a benchmark with future extensions to both the combined system, as well as to the geometric task planner.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Automated planning is a major topic of research in artificial intelligence, and enjoys a long and distinguished history. The classical paradigm assumes a distinguished initial state, comprised of a set of facts, and is defined over a set of actions which change that state in one way or another. Planning in many real-world settings, however, is much more involved: an agent's knowledge is almost never simply a set of facts that are true, and actions that the agent intends to execute never operate the way they are supposed to. Thus, probabilistic planning attempts to incorporate stochastic models directly into the planning process. In this article, we briefly report on probabilistic planning through the lens of probabilistic programming: a programming paradigm that aims to ease the specification of structured probability distributions. In particular, we provide an overview of the features of two systems, HYPE and ALLEGRO, which emphasise different strengths of probabilistic programming that are particularly useful for complex modelling issues raised in probabilistic planning. Among other things, with these systems, one can instantiate planning problems with growing and shrinking state spaces, discrete and continuous probability distributions, and non-unique prior distributions in a first-order setting.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Explainable AI is an important area of research within which Explainable Planning is an emerging topic. In this paper, we argue that Explainable Planning can be designed as a service -- that is, as a wrapper around an existing planning system that utilises the existing planner to assist in answering contrastive questions. We introduce a prototype framework to facilitate this, along with some examples of how a planner can be used to address certain types of contrastive questions. We discuss the main advantages and limitations of such an approach and we identify open questions for Explainable Planning as a service that identify several possible research directions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In a variety of application settings, the user preference for a planning task - the precise optimization objective - is difficult to elicit. One possible remedy is planning as an iterative process, allowing the user to iteratively refine and modify example plans. A key step to support such a process are explanations, answering user questions about the current plan. In particular, a relevant kind of question is "Why does the plan you suggest not satisfy $p$?", where p is a plan property desirable to the user. Note that such a question pertains to plan space, i.e., the set of possible alternative plans. Adopting the recent approach to answer such questions in terms of plan-property dependencies, here we implement a tool and user interface for human-guided iterative planning including plan-space explanations. The tool runs in standard Web browsers, and provides simple user interfaces for both developers and users. We conduct a first user study, whose outcome indicates the usefulness of plan-property dependency explanations in iterative planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Radiotherapy (RT) planning is complex, subjective, and time-intensive. Advances with artificial intelligence (AI) promise to improve its precision and efficiency, but progress is often limited by the scarcity of large, standardized datasets. To address this, we introduce the Automated Iterative RT Planning (AIRTP) system, a scalable solution for generating high-quality treatment plans. This scalable solution is designed to generate substantial volumes of consistently high-quality treatment plans, overcoming a key obstacle in the advancement of AI-driven RT planning. Our AIRTP pipeline adheres to clinical guidelines and automates essential steps, including organ-at-risk (OAR) contouring, helper structure creation, beam setup, optimization, and plan quality improvement, using AI integrated with RT planning software like Varian Eclipse. Furthermore, a novel approach for determining optimization parameters to reproduce 3D dose distributions, i.e. a method to convert dose predictions to deliverable treatment plans constrained by machine limitations is proposed. A comparative analysis of plan quality reveals that our automated pipeline produces treatment plans of quality comparable to those generated manually, which traditionally require several hours of labor per plan. Committed to public research, the first data release of our AIRTP pipeline includes nine cohorts covering head-and-neck and lung cancer sites to support an AAPM 2025 challenge. To our best knowledge, this dataset features more than 10 times number of plans compared to the largest existing well-curated public dataset.

<p class='card-text'>This paper explores the application of automated planning to automated theorem proving, which is a branch of automated reasoning concerned with the development of algorithms and computer programs to construct mathematical proofs. In particular, we investigate the use of planning to construct elementary proofs in abstract algebra, which provides a rigorous and axiomatic framework for studying algebraic structures such as groups, rings, fields, and modules. We implement basic implications, equalities, and rules in both deterministic and non-deterministic domains to model commutative rings and deduce elementary results about them. The success of this initial implementation suggests that the well-established techniques seen in automated planning are applicable to the relatively newer field of automated theorem proving. Likewise, automated theorem proving provides a new, challenging domain for automated planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Randomized sampling based algorithms are widely used in robot motion planning due to the problem's intractability, and are experimentally effective on a wide range of problem instances. Most variants do not sample uniformly at random, and instead bias their sampling using various heuristics for determining which samples will provide more information, or are more likely to participate in the final solution. In this work, we define the \emph{motion planning guiding space}, which encapsulates many seemingly distinct prior works under the same framework. In addition, we suggest an information theoretic method to evaluate guided planning which places the focus on the quality of the resulting biased sampling. Finally, we analyze several motion planning algorithms in order to demonstrate the applicability of our definition and its evaluation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The hierarchical structure of production planning has the advantage of assigning different decision variables to their respective time horizons and therefore ensures their manageability. However, the restrictive structure of this top-down approach implying that upper level decisions are the constraints for lower level decisions also has its shortcomings. One problem that occurs is that deterministic mixed integer decision problems are often used for long-term planning, but the real production system faces a set of stochastic influences. Therefore, a planned utilisation factor has to be included into this deterministic aggregate planning problem. In practice, this decision is often based on past data and not consciously taken. In this paper, the effect of long-term forecast error on the optimal planned utilisation factor is evaluated for a production system facing stochastic demand and the benefit of exploiting this decision's potential is discussed. Overall costs including capacity, backorder and inventory costs, are determined with simulation for different multi-stage and multi-item production system structures. The results show that the planned utilisation factor used in the aggregate planning problem has a high influence on optimal costs. Additionally, the negative effect of forecast errors is evaluated and discussed in detail for different production system environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>To make effective decisions in novel environments with long-horizon goals, it is crucial to engage in hierarchical reasoning across spatial and temporal scales. This entails planning abstract subgoal sequences, visually reasoning about the underlying plans, and executing actions in accordance with the devised plan through visual-motor control. We propose Compositional Foundation Models for Hierarchical Planning (HiP), a foundation model which leverages multiple expert foundation model trained on language, vision and action data individually jointly together to solve long-horizon tasks. We use a large language model to construct symbolic plans that are grounded in the environment through a large video diffusion model. Generated video plans are then grounded to visual-motor control, through an inverse dynamics model that infers actions from generated videos. To enable effective reasoning within this hierarchy, we enforce consistency between the models via iterative refinement. We illustrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach in three different long-horizon table-top manipulation tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The research in hierarchical planning has made considerable progress in the last few years. Many recent systems do not rely on hand-tailored advice anymore to find solutions, but are supposed to be domain-independent systems that come with sophisticated solving techniques. In principle, this development would make the comparison between systems easier (because the domains are not tailored to a single system anymore) and -- much more important -- also the integration into other systems, because the modeling process is less tedious (due to the lack of advice) and there is no (or less) commitment to a certain planning system the model is created for. However, these advantages are destroyed by the lack of a common input language and feature set supported by the different systems. In this paper, we propose an extension to PDDL, the description language used in non-hierarchical planning, to the needs of hierarchical planning systems. We restrict our language to a basic feature set shared by many recent systems, give an extension of PDDL's EBNF syntax definition, and discuss our extensions with respect to several planner-specific input languages from related work.</p>

<p class='card-text'>General-purpose service robots are expected to undertake a broad range of tasks at the request of users. Knowledge representation and planning systems are essential to flexible autonomous robots, but the field lacks a unified perspective on which features are essential for general-purpose service robots. Progress towards planning and reasoning for general-purpose service robots is hindered by differing assumptions about users, the environment, and the overall robot system. In this position paper, we propose desiderata for planning and reasoning systems to promote general-purpose service robots. Each proposed item draws on our experience with research on service robots in the office and home and on the demands of these environments. Our desiderata emphasize support for natural human-interfaces as well as for robust fallback methods when interactions with humans and the environment fail. We highlight relevant work towards these goals.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In this paper, we address the knowledge engineering problems for hypothesis generation motivated by applications that require timely exploration of hypotheses under unreliable observations. We looked at two applications: malware detection and intensive care delivery. In intensive care, the goal is to generate plausible hypotheses about the condition of the patient from clinical observations and further refine these hypotheses to create a recovery plan for the patient. Similarly, preventing malware spread within a corporate network involves generating hypotheses from network traffic data and selecting preventive actions. To this end, building on the already established characterization and use of AI planning for similar problems, we propose use of planning for the hypothesis generation problem. However, to deal with uncertainty, incomplete model description and unreliable observations, we need to use a planner capable of generating multiple high-quality plans. To capture the model description we propose a language called LTS++ and a web-based tool that enables the specification of the LTS++ model and a set of observations. We also proposed a 9-step process that helps provide guidance to the domain expert in specifying the LTS++ model. The hypotheses are then generated by running a planner on the translated LTS++ model and the provided trace. The hypotheses can be visualized and shown to the analyst or can be further investigated automatically.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Intelligent Cyber-physical systems can be modelled as multi-agent systems with planning capability to impart adaptivity for changing contexts. In such multi-agent systems, the protocol for plan execution must result in the proper completion and ordering of actions in spite of their distributed execution. However, in untrusted scenarios, there is a possibility of agents not respecting the protocol either due to faults or due to malicious reasons thereby resulting in plan failure. In order to prevent such situations, we propose to implement the execution of agents through smart contracts. This points to a generic architecture seamlessly integrating intelligent planning-based CPS and smart-contracts.</p>

<p class='card-text'>With the recent advances in machine learning, path planning algorithms are also evolving; however, the learned path planning algorithms often have difficulty competing with success rates of classic algorithms. We propose waypoint planning networks (WPN), a hybrid algorithm based on LSTMs with a local kernel - a classic algorithm such as A*, and a global kernel using a learned algorithm. WPN produces a more computationally efficient and robust solution. We compare WPN against A*, as well as related works including motion planning networks (MPNet) and value iteration networks (VIN). In this paper, the design and experiments have been conducted for 2D environments. Experimental results outline the benefits of WPN, both in efficiency and generalization. It is shown that WPN's search space is considerably less than A*, while being able to generate near optimal results. Additionally, WPN works on partial maps, unlike A* which needs the full map in advance. The code is available online.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Planning safe paths in 3D workspace for high DoF robotic systems, such as manipulators, is a challenging problem, especially when the environment is populated with the dynamic obstacles that need to be avoided. In this case the time dimension should be taken into account that further increases the complexity of planning. To mitigate this issue we suggest to combine safe-interval path planning (a prominent technique in heuristic search) with the randomized planning, specifically, with the bidirectional rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT-Connect) - a fast and efficient algorithm for high-dimensional planning. Leveraging a dedicated technique of fast computation of the safe intervals we end up with an efficient planner dubbed SI-RRT. We compare it with the state of the art and show that SI-RRT consistently outperforms the competitors both in runtime and solution cost.
  Our implementation of SI-RRT is publicly available at https://github.com/PathPlanning/ManipulationPlanning-SI-RRT</p>

<p class='card-text'>The propositional planning problem is a notoriously difficult computational problem, which remains hard even under strong syntactical and structural restrictions. Given its difficulty it becomes natural to study planning in the context of parameterized complexity. In this paper we continue the work initiated by Downey, Fellows and Stege on the parameterized complexity of planning with respect to the parameter "length of the solution plan." We provide a complete classification of the parameterized complexity of the planning problem under two of the most prominent syntactical restrictions, i.e., the so called PUBS restrictions introduced by Baeckstroem and Nebel and restrictions on the number of preconditions and effects as introduced by Bylander. We also determine which of the considered fixed-parameter tractable problems admit a polynomial kernel and which don't.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Francesco Fabiano, Biplav Srivastava, Jonathan Lenchner, Lior Horesh, Francesca Rossi, Marianna Bergamaschi Ganapini</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Epistemic Planning (EP) refers to an automated planning setting where the agent reasons in the space of knowledge states and tries to find a plan to reach a desirable state from the current state. Its general form, the Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) problem involves multiple agents who need to reason about both the state of the world and the information flow between agents. In a MEP problem, multiple approaches have been developed recently with varying restrictions, such as considering only the concept of knowledge while not allowing the idea of belief, or not allowing for ``complex" modal operators such as those needed to handle dynamic common knowledge. While the diversity of approaches has led to a deeper understanding of the problem space, the lack of a standardized way to specify MEP problems independently of solution approaches has created difficulties in comparing performance of planners, identifying promising techniques, exploring new strategies like ensemble methods, and making it easy for new researchers to contribute to this research area. To address the situation, we propose a unified way of specifying EP problems - the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language, E-PDDL. We show that E-PPDL can be supported by leading MEP planners and provide corresponding parser code that translates EP problems specified in E-PDDL into (M)EP problems that can be handled by several planners. This work is also useful in building more general epistemic planning environments where we envision a meta-cognitive module that takes a planning problem in E-PDDL, identifies and assesses some of its features, and autonomously decides which planner is the best one to solve it.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Many AI applications involve the interaction of multiple autonomous agents, requiring those agents to reason about their own beliefs, as well as those of other agents. However, planning involving nested beliefs is known to be computationally challenging. In this work, we address the task of synthesizing plans that necessitate reasoning about the beliefs of other agents. We plan from the perspective of a single agent with the potential for goals and actions that involve nested beliefs, non-homogeneous agents, co-present observations, and the ability for one agent to reason as if it were another. We formally characterize our notion of planning with nested belief, and subsequently demonstrate how to automatically convert such problems into problems that appeal to classical planning technology for solving efficiently. Our approach represents an important step towards applying the well-established field of automated planning to the challenging task of planning involving nested beliefs of multiple agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The paper introduces a novel representation for Generalized Planning (GP) problems, and their solutions, as C++ programs. Our C++ representation allows to formally proving the termination of generalized plans, and to specifying their asymptotic complexity w.r.t. the number of world objects. Characterizing the complexity of C++ generalized plans enables the application of a combinatorial search that enumerates the space of possible GP solutions in order of complexity. Experimental results show that our implementation of this approach, which we call BFGP++, outperforms the previous GP as heuristic search approach for the computation of generalized plans represented as compiler-styled programs. Last but not least, the execution of a C++ program on a classical planning instance is a deterministic grounding-free and search-free process, so our C++ representation allows us to automatically validate the computed solutions on large test instances of thousands of objects, where off-the-shelf classical planners get stuck either in the pre-processing or in the search.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2023-08-22 19:51:48</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper presents VBMO, the Voting-Based Multi-Objective path planning algorithm, that generates optimal single-objective plans, evaluates each of them with respect to the other objectives, and selects one with a voting mechanism. VBMO does not use hand-tuned weights, consider the multiple objectives at every step of search, or use an evolutionary algorithm. Instead, it considers how a plan that is optimal in one objective may perform well with respect to others. VBMO incorporates three voting mechanisms: range, Borda, and combined approval. Extensive evaluation in diverse and complex environments demonstrates the algorithm's ability to efficiently produce plans that satisfy multiple objectives.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent to learn from trial-and-error experiences toward achieving long-term goals; automated planning aims to compute plans for accomplishing tasks using action knowledge. Despite their shared goal of completing complex tasks, the development of RL and automated planning has been largely isolated due to their different computational modalities. Focusing on improving RL agents' learning efficiency, we develop Guided Dyna-Q (GDQ) to enable RL agents to reason with action knowledge to avoid exploring less-relevant states. The action knowledge is used for generating artificial experiences from an optimistic simulation. GDQ has been evaluated in simulation and using a mobile robot conducting navigation tasks in a multi-room office environment. Compared with competitive baselines, GDQ significantly reduces the effort in exploration while improving the quality of learned policies.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Local motion planning is a heavily researched topic in the field of robotics with many promising algorithms being published every year. However, it is difficult and time-consuming to compare different methods in the field. In this paper, we present localPlannerBench, a new benchmarking suite that allows quick and seamless comparison between local motion planning algorithms. The key focus of the project lies in the extensibility of the environment and the simulation cases. Out-of-the-box, localPlannerBench already supports many simulation cases ranging from a simple 2D point mass to full-fledged 3D 7DoF manipulators, and it is straightforward to add your own custom robot using a URDF file. A post-processor is built-in that can be extended with custom metrics and plots. To integrate your own motion planner, simply create a wrapper that derives from the provided base class. Ultimately we aim to improve the reproducibility of local motion planning algorithms and encourage standardized open-source comparison.</p>
