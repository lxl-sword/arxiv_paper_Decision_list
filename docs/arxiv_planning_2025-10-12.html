<p class='card-text'>Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic
systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted
offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected
validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from
offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these
settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time
infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly
across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work,
we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive
set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in
simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online
settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of
current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge
the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric
based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to
cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13%
improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further
validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment
in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central
goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on
fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.
We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task
description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any
demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a
video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using
off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative
poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals
and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a
tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics
model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow
naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and
deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot
quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without
demonstrations or embodiment-specific training. Project website:

<p class='card-text'>Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and
depth of thinking. It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and
reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial
challenges for agentic systems. To address this, we propose FlowSearch, a
multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic structured
knowledge flow to drive subtask execution and reasoning. FlowSearch is capable
of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to enable parallel
exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also adjusting the
knowledge flow in real time based on feedback from intermediate reasoning
outcomes and insights. FlowSearch achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
general and scientific benchmarks, including GAIA, HLE, GPQA and TRQA,
demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research scenarios and
its potential to advance scientific discovery. The code is available at

<p class='card-text'>Micro-randomized trials (MRTs) are increasingly used to evaluate mobile
health interventions with binary proximal outcomes. Standard inverse
probability weighting (IPW) estimators are unbiased but unstable in small
samples or under extreme randomization. Estimated mean excursion effect (EMEE)
improves efficiency but lacks double robustness. We propose a doubly robust
EMEE (DR-EMEE) with stabilized and truncated weights, combining per-decision
IPW and outcome regression. We prove double robustness, asymptotic efficiency,
and provide finite-sample variance corrections, with extensions to machine
learning nuisance estimators. In simulations, DR-EMEE reduces root mean squared
error, improves coverage, and achieves up to twofold efficiency gains over IPW
and five to ten percent over EMEE. Applications to HeartSteps, PAMAP2, and
mHealth datasets confirm stable and efficient inference across both randomized

<p class='card-text'>Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than
maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management.
This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a
unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling
reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)
constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent
dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes
policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that
converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.
We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail
inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic
volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves
long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\% and sMAPE by
32\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe
ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These
results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration
aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust,
generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-09 13:09:18</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Increase in the number of space exploration missions has led to the
accumulation of space debris, posing risk of collision with the operational
satellites. Addressing this challenge is crucial for the sustainability of
space operations. To plan a safe trajectory in the presence of moving space
debris, an integrated approach of artificial potential field and sliding mode
controller is proposed and implemented in this paper. The relative 6-DOF
kinematics and dynamics of the spacecraft is modelled in the framework of
geometric mechanics with the relative configuration expressed through
exponential coordinates. Various collision avoidance guidance algorithms have
been proposed in the literature but the Artificial Potential Field guidance
algorithm is computationally efficient and enables real-time path adjustments
to avoid collision with obstacles. However, it is prone to issues such as local
minima. In literature, local minima issue is typically avoided by either
redefining the potential function such as adding vorticity or by employing
search techniques which are computationally expensive. To address these
challenges, a physics-informed APF is proposed in this paper where Hamiltonian
mechanics is used instead of the traditional Newtonian mechanics-based
approach. In this approach, instead of relying on attractive and repulsive
forces for path planning, the Hamiltonian approach uses the potential field to
define a path of minimum potential. Additionally, to track the desired
trajectory planned by the guidance algorithm within a fixed-time frame, a
non-singular fixed-time sliding mode controller (FTSMC) is used. The proposed
fixed-time sliding surface not only ensures fixed-time convergence of system
states but also guarantees the global stability of the closed-loop system
without singularity. The simulation results presented support the claims made.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-09 11:35:54</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper presents a general mathematical programming framework for the
design and optimization of supply chain infrastructures for the upcycling of
plastic waste. For this purpose, a multi-product, multi-echelon, multi-period
mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model has been formulated. The
objective is to minimize the cost of the entire circular supply chain starting
from the collection of post-consumer plastic waste to the production of
virgin-equivalent high value polymers, satisfying a large number of constraints
from collection quota to the quality of the feedstock. The framework aims to
support the strategic planning of future circular supply chains by determining
the optimal number, locations and sizes of various types of facilities as well
as the amounts of materials to be transported between the nodes of the supply
chain network over a specified period. The functionality of the framework has
been tested with a case study for the upcycling of rigid polyurethane foam
waste coming from construction sites in Germany. The economic potential and
infrastructure requirements are evaluated, and it has been found that from a
solely economic perspective, the current status of the value chain is not
competitive with fossil-based feedstock or incineration. However, with the
right economic incentives, there is a considerable potential to establish such
value chains, once the upcycling technology is ready and the economic framework

<p class='card-text'>Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate

<p class='card-text'>Enabling robots to perform precise and generalized manipulation in
unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their
high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for
real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we
introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through
executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that
encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of
manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline
that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an
instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan
physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides
a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction
understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and
generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization
across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world

the ability to serve as high-level planners, enabling robots to follow complex
human instructions. However, their effectiveness, especially in long-horizon
tasks involving dual-arm humanoid robots, remains limited. This limitation
arises from two main challenges: (i) the absence of simulation platforms that
systematically support task evaluation and data collection for humanoid robots,
and (ii) the insufficient embodiment awareness of current MLLMs, which hinders
reasoning about dual-arm selection logic and body positions during planning. To
address these issues, we present DualTHOR, a new dual-arm humanoid simulator,
with continuous transition and a contingency mechanism. Building on this
platform, we propose Proprio-MLLM, a model that enhances embodiment awareness

<p class='card-text'>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) enable autonomous mobile agents to
operate smartphone user interfaces, yet vulnerabilities to UI-level attacks
remain critically understudied. Existing research often depends on conspicuous
UI overlays, elevated permissions, or impractical threat models, limiting
stealth and real-world applicability. In this paper, we present a practical and
stealthy one-shot jailbreak attack that leverages in-app prompt injections:
malicious applications embed short prompts in UI text that remain inert during
human interaction but are revealed when an agent drives the UI via ADB (Android
Debug Bridge). Our framework comprises three crucial components: (1)
low-privilege perception-chain targeting, which injects payloads into malicious
apps as the agent's visual inputs; (2) stealthy user-invisible activation, a
touch-based trigger that discriminates agent from human touches using physical
touch attributes and exposes the payload only during agent operation; and (3)
one-shot prompt efficacy, a heuristic-guided, character-level
iterative-deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs one-shot,

across multiple LVLM backends, including closed-source services and
representative open-source models within three Android applications, and we

<p class='card-text'>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench

<p class='card-text'>We address the challenge of enabling bipedal robots to traverse rough terrain
by developing probabilistically safe planning and control strategies that
ensure dynamic feasibility and centroidal robustness under terrain uncertainty.
Specifically, we propose a high-level Model Predictive Control (MPC) navigation
framework for a bipedal robot with a specified confidence level of safety that
(i) enables safe traversal toward a desired goal location across a terrain map
with uncertain elevations, and (ii) formally incorporates uncertainty bounds
into the centroidal dynamics of locomotion control. To model the rough terrain,
we employ Gaussian Process (GP) regression to estimate elevation maps and
leverage Conformal Prediction (CP) to construct calibrated confidence intervals
that capture the true terrain elevation. Building on this, we formulate
contraction-based reachable tubes that explicitly account for terrain
uncertainty, ensuring state convergence and tube invariance. In addition, we
introduce a contraction-based flywheel torque control law for the reduced-order
Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM), which stabilizes the angular momentum
about the center-of-mass (CoM). This formulation provides both probabilistic
safety and goal reachability guarantees. For a given confidence level, we
establish the forward invariance of the proposed torque control law by
demonstrating exponential stabilization of the actual CoM phase-space
trajectory and the desired trajectory prescribed by the high-level planner.
Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our planning framework through
physics-based simulations of the Digit bipedal robot in MuJoCo.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such

<p class='card-text'>The aging and increasing complexity of infrastructures make efficient
inspection planning more critical in ensuring safety. Thanks to sampling-based
motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require
huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is
large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry
and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit
models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most
primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been
designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn
requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent
transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during
planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called
Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable
sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation
during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a
complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates
that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate
inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the
state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the
state-of-the-art inspection planner.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 21:03:14</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Dexterous manipulation tasks often require switching between different
contact modes, such as rolling, sliding, sticking, or non-contact contact
modes. When formulating dexterous manipulation tasks as a trajectory
optimization problem, a common approach is to decompose these tasks into
sub-tasks for each contact mode, which are each solved independently.
Optimizing each sub-task independently can limit performance, as optimizing
contact points, contact forces, or other variables without information about
future sub-tasks can place the system in a state from which it is challenging
to make progress on subsequent sub-tasks. Further, optimizing these sub-tasks
is very computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose
Amortized Value Optimization (AVO), which introduces a learned value function
that predicts the total future task performance. By incorporating this value
function into the cost of the trajectory optimization at each planning step,
the value function gradients guide the optimizer toward states that minimize
the cost in future sub-tasks. This effectively bridges separately optimized
sub-tasks, and accelerates the optimization by reducing the amount of online
computation needed. We validate AVO on a screwdriver grasping and turning task
in both simulation and real world experiments, and show improved performance
even with 50% less computational budget compared to trajectory optimization
without the value function.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Jun Liu</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 18:09:52</h6>
<p class='card-text'>To overcome the bottleneck of classical path planning schemes in solving NP
problems and address the predicament faced by current mainstream quantum path
planning frameworks in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, this
study attempts to construct a quantum path planning solution based on parallel
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) architecture. Specifically,
the grid path planning problem is mapped to the problem of finding the minimum
quantum energy state. Two parallel QAOA circuits are built to simultaneously
execute two solution processes, namely connectivity energy calculation and path
energy calculation. A classical algorithm is employed to filter out
unreasonable solutions of connectivity energy, and finally, the approximate
optimal solution to the path planning problem is obtained by merging the
calculation results of the two parallel circuits. The research findings
indicate that by setting appropriate filter parameters, quantum states
corresponding to position points with extremely low occurrence probabilities
can be effectively filtered out, thereby increasing the probability of
obtaining the target quantum state. Even when the circuit layer number p is
only 1, the theoretical solution of the optimal path coding combination can
still be found by leveraging the critical role of the filter. Compared with
serial circuits, parallel circuits exhibit a significant advantage, as they can
find the optimal feasible path coding combination with the highest probability.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 17:40:41</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Many real-world scenarios require multiple agents to coordinate in shared
environments, while balancing trade-offs between multiple, potentially
competing objectives. Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding
(MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Pareto
frontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even
when the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of
objectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along
with an algorithm \textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that
directly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference
over objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search with
conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enabling
efficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insights
into optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computes
optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- far
beyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods. Evaluations on standard and
randomized MAPF benchmarks show consistently higher success rates against
state-of-the-art baselines, especially with increasing number of objectives.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) trains policies that
reach user-specified goals at test time, providing a simple, unsupervised,
domain-agnostic way to extract diverse behaviors from unlabeled, reward-free
datasets. Nonetheless, long-horizon decision making remains difficult for GCRL
agents due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, and the
offline setting amplifies these effects. To alleviate this issue, we introduce
Test-Time Graph Search (TTGS), a lightweight planning approach to solve the
GCRL task. TTGS accepts any state-space distance or cost signal, builds a
weighted graph over dataset states, and performs fast search to assemble a
sequence of subgoals that a frozen policy executes. When the base learner is
value-based, the distance is derived directly from the learned goal-conditioned
value function, so no handcrafted metric is needed. TTGS requires no changes to
training, no additional supervision, no online interaction, and no privileged
information, and it runs entirely at inference. On the OGBench benchmark, TTGS
improves success rates of multiple base learners on challenging locomotion
tasks, demonstrating the benefit of simple metric-guided test-time planning for
offline GCRL.</p>

  Micro-Mobility Services</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Binyu Yang, Jinxiao Du, Junlin He, Shi An, Wei Ma</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 16:26:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The spatial-temporal imbalance between supply and demand in shared
micro-mobility services often leads to observed demand being censored,
resulting in incomplete records of the underlying real demand. This phenomenon
undermines the reliability of the collected demand data and hampers downstream
applications such as demand forecasting, fleet management, and micro-mobility
planning. How to accurately estimate the real demand is challenging and has not
been well explored in existing studies. In view of this, we contribute to real
demand estimation for shared micro-mobility services by proposing an analytical
method that rigorously derives the real demand under appropriate assumptions.
Rather than directly modeling the intractable relationship between observed
demand and real demand, we propose a novel random variable, Generalized Vehicle
Survival Time (GVST), which is observable from trip records. The relationship
between GVST and real demand is characterized by introducing a flipped queueing
model (FQM) that captures the operational dynamics of shared micro-mobility
services. Specifically, the distribution of GVST is derived within the FQM,
which allows the real demand estimation problem to be transformed into an
inverse queueing problem. We analytically derive the real demand in closed form
using a one-sided estimation method, and solve the problem by a system of
equations in a two-sided estimation method. We validate the proposed methods
using synthetic data and conduct empirical analyses using real-world datasets
from bike-sharing and shared e-scooter systems. The experimental results show
that both the two-sided and one-sided methods outperform benchmark models. In
particular, the one-sided approach provides a closed-form solution that
delivers acceptable accuracy, constituting a practical rule of thumb for
demand-related analytics and decision-making processes.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-fingered hands are emerging as powerful platforms for performing fine
manipulation tasks, including tool use. However, environmental perturbations or
execution errors can impede task performance, motivating the use of recovery
behaviors that enable normal task execution to resume. In this work, we take
advantage of recent advances in diffusion models to construct a framework that
autonomously identifies when recovery is necessary and optimizes contact-rich
trajectories to recover. We use a diffusion model trained on the task to
estimate when states are not conducive to task execution, framed as an
out-of-distribution detection problem. We then use diffusion sampling to
project these states in-distribution and use trajectory optimization to plan
contact-rich recovery trajectories. We also propose a novel diffusion-based
approach that distills this process to efficiently diffuse the full
parameterization, including constraints, goal state, and initialization, of the
recovery trajectory optimization problem, saving time during online execution.
We compare our method to a reinforcement learning baseline and other methods
that do not explicitly plan contact interactions, including on a hardware
screwdriver-turning task where we show that recovering using our method
improves task performance by 96% and that ours is the only method evaluated
that can attempt recovery without causing catastrophic task failure. Videos can

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 13:57:29</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Periodic 3D reconstruction is essential for crop monitoring, but costly when
each cycle restarts from scratch, wasting resources and ignoring information
from previous captures. We propose temporal-prior-guided view planning for
periodic plant reconstruction, in which a previously reconstructed model of the
same plant is non-rigidly aligned to a new partial observation to form an
approximation of the current geometry. To accommodate plant growth, we inflate
this approximation and solve a set covering optimization problem to compute a
minimal set of views. We integrated this method into a complete pipeline that
acquires one additional next-best view before registration for robustness and
then plans a globally shortest path to connect the planned set of views and
outputs the best view sequence. Experiments on maize and tomato under
hemisphere and sphere view spaces show that our system maintains or improves
surface coverage while requiring fewer views and comparable movement cost
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 13:28:55</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This study develops and analyzes an optimization model of smart contract
adoption under bounded risk, linking structural theory with simulation and
real-world validation. We examine how adoption intensity alpha is structurally
pinned at a boundary solution, invariant to variance and heterogeneity, while
profitability and service outcomes are variance-fragile, eroding under
volatility and heavy-tailed demand. A sharp threshold in the fixed cost
parameter A3 triggers discontinuous adoption collapse (H1), variance shocks
reduce profits monotonically but not adoption (H2), and additional results on
readiness heterogeneity (H3), profit-service co-benefits (H4), and
distributional robustness (H5) confirm the duality between stable adoption and
fragile payoffs. External validity checks further establish convergence of
sample average approximation at the canonical O(1/sqrt(N)) rate (H6). Empirical
validation using S&P 500 returns and the MovieLens100K dataset corroborates the
theoretical structure: bounded and heavy-tailed distributions fit better than
Gaussian models, and profits diverge across volatility regimes even as adoption
remains stable. Taken together, the results demonstrate that adoption choices
are robust to uncertainty, but their financial consequences are highly fragile.
For operations and finance, this duality underscores the need for risk-adjusted
performance evaluation, option-theoretic modeling, and distributional stress
testing in strategic investment and supply chain design.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous
driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning
approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning
suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
(GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key
source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a
discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic
interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed
Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map

neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that
augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging
overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 11:30:57</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Effective path planning is fundamental to the coordination of unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) systems, particularly in
applications such as surveillance, navigation, and emergency response.
Combining UAVs' broad field of view with UGVs' ground-level operational
capability greatly improve the likelihood of successfully achieving task
objectives such as locating victims, monitoring target areas, or navigating
hazardous terrain. In complex environments, UAVs need to provide precise
environmental perception information for UGVs to optimize their routing policy.
However, due to severe interference and non-line-of-sight conditions, wireless
communication is often unstable in such complex environments, making it
difficult to support timely and accurate path planning for UAV-UGV
coordination. To this end, this paper proposes a semantic communication
(SemCom) framework to enhance UAV/UGV cooperative path planning under
unreliable wireless conditions. Unlike traditional methods that transmit raw
data, SemCom transmits only the key information for path planning, reducing
transmission volume without sacrificing accuracy. The proposed framework is
developed by defining key semantics for path planning and designing a
transceiver for meeting the requirements of UAV-UGV cooperative path planning.
Simulation results show that, compared to conventional SemCom transceivers, the
proposed transceiver significantly reduces data transmission volume while
maintaining path planning accuracy, thereby enhancing system collaboration
efficiency.</p>
