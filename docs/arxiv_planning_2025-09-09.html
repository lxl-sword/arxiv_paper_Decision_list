<p class='card-text'>Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable
environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical
motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full
environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural
motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop
directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or
dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural
motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic
environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is
IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million
generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further
improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher
finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at
inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We
evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving
obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,
outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both
simulated and real-world settings. Video results and code available at

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-08 17:58:30</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a
central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to
short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,
we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual
foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a
Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,
foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,
and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to
synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By
forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation
as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that
implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable
capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset
comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training
scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual
foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive
evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1
consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in
both task success rate and generalization ability.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-08 13:43:09</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Deploying self-navigating surface vessels in inland waterways offers a
sustainable alternative to reduce road traffic congestion and emissions.
However, navigating confined waterways presents unique challenges, including
narrow channels, higher traffic density, and hydrodynamic disturbances.
Existing methods for autonomous vessel navigation often lack the robustness or
precision required for such environments. This paper presents a new motion
planning approach for Automated Surface Vessels (ASVs) using Robust Model
Predictive Control (RMPC) combined with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). By
incorporating channel borders and obstacles as safety constraints within the
control design framework, the proposed method ensures both collision avoidance
and robust navigation on complex waterways. Simulation results demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed method in safely guiding ASVs under realistic
conditions, highlighting its improved safety and adaptability compared to the
state-of-the-art.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-08 13:38:39</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper presents an adaptive coverage control method for a fleet of
off-road and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) operating in dynamic
(time-varying) agricultural environments. Traditional coverage control
approaches often assume static conditions, making them unsuitable for
real-world farming scenarios where obstacles, such as moving machinery and
uneven terrains, create continuous challenges. To address this, we propose a
real-time path planning framework that integrates Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) for obstacle detection and terrain assessment, allowing UGVs to
dynamically adjust their coverage paths. The environment is modeled as a
weighted directed graph, where the edge weights are continuously updated based
on the UAV observations to reflect obstacle motion and terrain variations. The
proposed approach incorporates Voronoi-based partitioning, adaptive edge weight
assignment, and cost-based path optimization to enhance navigation efficiency.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
improving path planning, reducing traversal costs, and maintaining robust
coverage in the presence of dynamic obstacles and muddy terrains.</p>

  Long-Term AUV Operations</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-08 13:36:27</h6>
<p class='card-text'>As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-08 12:57:02</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding
in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper
proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like
cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a
plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and
Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select"
cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to
guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves
cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering.
Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional
entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing
unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and
Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with
their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields
consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline
combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points,
demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch"

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-08 12:04:12</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Accurate odometry is a critical component in a robotic navigation stack, and
subsequent modules such as planning and control often rely on an estimate of
the robot's motion. Sensor-based odometry approaches should be robust across
sensor types and deployable in different target domains, from solid-state
LiDARs mounted on cars in urban-driving scenarios to spinning LiDARs on
handheld packages used in unstructured natural environments. In this paper, we
propose a robust LiDAR-inertial odometry system that does not rely on
sensor-specific modeling. Sensor fusion techniques for LiDAR and inertial
measurement unit (IMU) data typically integrate IMU data iteratively in a
Kalman filter or use pre-integration in a factor graph framework, combined with
LiDAR scan matching often exploiting some form of feature extraction. We
propose an alternative strategy that only requires a simplified motion model
for IMU integration and directly registers LiDAR scans in a scan-to-map
approach. Our approach allows us to impose a novel regularization on the LiDAR
registration, improving the overall odometry performance. We detail extensive
experiments on a number of datasets covering a wide array of commonly used
robotic sensors and platforms. We show that our approach works with the exact
same configuration in all these scenarios, demonstrating its robustness. We
have open-sourced our implementation so that the community can build further on
our work and use it in their navigation stacks.</p>

hindering the networking community's understanding of its dynamics. This paper
leverages publicly available Internet Exchange Point traffic statistics to

472 IXPs worldwide, capturing approximately 300 Tbps of peak daily aggregate
traffic by late 2024. Our analysis reveals a 49.2% global traffic increase
(24.5% annualized), uncovers regionally distinct diurnal patterns and
event-driven anomalies, and demonstrates stable utilization rates, reflecting
predictable infrastructure scaling. By analyzing biases and confirming high
self-similarity, we establish IXP traffic as a robust proxy for overall
Internet growth and usage behavior. With transparent, replicable data--covering
87% of the worldwide IXP port capacity--and plans to release our dataset, this

<p class='card-text'>Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:

This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with

<p class='card-text'>Networked Control System (NCS) is a paradigm where sensors, controllers, and
actuators communicate over a shared network. One promising application of NCS
is the control of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in the industrial
environment, for example to transport goods efficiently and to autonomously
follow predefined paths or routes. In this context, communication and control
are tightly correlated, a paradigm referred to as Joint Communication and
Control (JCC), since network issues such as delays or errors can lead to
significant deviations of the AGVs from the planned trajectory. In this paper,
we present a simulation framework based on Gazebo and Robot Operating System 2
(ROS 2) to simulate and visualize, respectively, the complex interaction
between the control of AGVs and the underlying communication network. This
framework explicitly incorporates communication metrics, such as delay and
packet loss, and control metrics, especially the Mean Squared Error (MSE)
between the optimal/desired and actual path of the AGV in response to driving

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-08 06:59:46</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) involves planning efficient paths for
multiple agents to move simultaneously while avoiding collisions. In typical
warehouse environments, agents are often sparsely distributed along aisles.
However, increasing the agent density can improve space efficiency. When the
agent density is high, we must optimize the paths not only for goal-assigned
agents but also for those obstructing them. This study proposes a novel MAPF
framework for high-density environments (MAPF-HD). Several studies have
explored MAPF in similar settings using integer linear programming (ILP).
However, ILP-based methods require substantial computation time to optimize all
agent paths simultaneously. Even in small grid-based environments with fewer
than $100$ cells, these computations can incur tens to hundreds of seconds.
These high computational costs render these methods impractical for large-scale
applications such as automated warehouses and valet parking. To address these
limitations, we introduce the phased null-agent swapping (PHANS) method. PHANS
employs a heuristic approach to incrementally swap positions between agents and
empty vertices. This method solves the MAPF-HD problem within seconds to tens
of seconds, even in large environments containing more than $700$ cells. The
proposed method can potentially improve efficiency in various real-world
applications such as warehouse logistics, traffic management, or crowd control.

We introduce an algorithmic framework for the Minimum-Cost Synthetic Genome
Planning problem, aiming to identify the most cost-effective strategy to
assemble a target genome from a source genome through a combination of reuse,
synthesis, and join operations. By comparing dynamic programming and greedy
heuristic strategies under diverse cost regimes, we demonstrate how algorithmic

problem and systematically compare the performance of the COIN-OR Branch and
Cut (CBC) solver with heuristic methods, including Tabu Search and Iterative
Targeted Pairwise Swap. Scalability experiment on instances with up to 100,000
orders show that CBC consistently achieves optimal solutions in under two
minutes, maintaining optimality even under dynamic conditions with fluctuating
factory capacities and changing customer orders. By reducing day-to-day recipe
discrepancies, this approach supports more accurate ingredient forecasting,
decreases food waste, and improves operational efficiency across multi-factory
network. These results provide the first comprehensive solution framework for

<p class='card-text'>POEMMA Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a NASA super-pressure balloon mission
building toward the proposed Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics
(POEMMA) dual satellite mission. In its planned 2027 launch, PBR will study
Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays, Neutrinos, and High-Altitude Horizontal
Airshowers from 33 km above the Earth. By operating at balloon altitudes, PBR
will provide a novel vantage point to study air-shower physics while offering
competitive instantaneous exposure to neutrinos from transient astrophysical
phenomena. The payload's optical instrument is a 0.95 m$^2$ aperture hybrid
Schmidt telescope with a 3.81 m$^2$ segmented mirror focusing light onto a
Fluorescence Camera and a bi-focalized Cherenkov Camera. The payload will also
feature a Radio Instrument consisting of two sinuous antennas based on the
Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO) low-frequency instrument. A
combined gamma ray/x-ray detector and IR cloud camera round out the
instrumentation package, meaning PBR will be the first multi-hybrid
balloon-borne multi-messenger observatory flown. This extensive instrumentation
must be combined into a radio quiet payload that satisfies the scientific needs
and can operate in near vacuum at extreme temperatures, all while meeting NASA
safety requirements and weighing no more than 3000 lbs (1361 kg). Accomplishing
these tasks together will mark a significant step toward establishing
technological readiness for the POEMMA satellite mission. We present an
overview of PBR's mechanical and optical systems, additionally detailing our
strategies to mitigate electromagnetic interference for the radio instrument
and prepare for the harsh near-space environment.</p>

<p class='card-text'>A good understanding of cities is crucial to implement urban planning
policies leading to social and economic sustainability and an efficient use of
resources. While urban concentration has been associated with both positive and
negative effects, echoing debates on compact cities, few studies have
documented how density evolves with city size. We fill this gap by
investigating how the population density radial structure changes across the
urban hierarchy. Our results uncover strong regularities in urban settlements.
In terms of density, cities can be seen as exponential cones which evolve
homothetically with city population. This rather simple but universal geometric
structure of cities provides a new spatial scaling law, which is an important
step forward in understanding how cities work and grow. Some deviations can be
observed, which mainly oppose dense cities in the developing world and sprawled
cities in high-income countries, associated with high energy use per capita.
This suggests that urban lifestyle in wealthiest countries has come at the
price of negative impacts on environmental outcomes. This research has a broad
range of applications as it provides a powerful tool to compare cities of
different sizes.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-07 16:18:31</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) systems provide mobile robots with a
rich set of motion modes, such as Ackermann steering, lateral steering, and
parallel movement, offering superior maneuverability in constrained
environments. However, existing path planning methods generally assume a single
kinematic model and thus fail to fully exploit the multi-modal capabilities of
4WIS platforms. To address this limitation, we propose an extended Hybrid A*
framework that operates in a four-dimensional state space incorporating both
spatial states and motion modes. Within this framework, we design multi-modal
Reeds-Shepp curves tailored to the distinct kinematic constraints of each
motion mode, develop an enhanced heuristic function that accounts for
mode-switching costs, and introduce a terminal connection strategy with
intelligent mode selection to ensure smooth transitions between different
steering patterns. The proposed planner enables seamless integration of
multiple motion modalities within a single path, significantly improving
flexibility and adaptability in complex environments. Results demonstrate
significantly improved planning performance for 4WIS robots in complex

terrains and Martian environmental hazards and suggested comprehensive
engineering strategies to overcome the odds and establish a successful mining
program in Martian volcanic regions. Slope stabilization methods - such as
terracing and anchored drilling rigs - with terrain-adaptive rovers capable of
autonomous operations on steep unstable slopes has been suggested as feasible
solutions to navigate the complex geological terrains of Martian volcanoes. The
mid range rover design with a mass of approximately 2.1 t, proposed here for
mining operations, incorporates a six-wheel rocker-bogie suspension,
anchoring-enabled drilling arm, dust-mitigation solar arrays, and advanced
sensing systems for hazard detection and navigation. A comparative analysis
regarding choice of roads and rails for building transport infrastructure has
also been performed. We have also looked into the energy requirement of the
rover to work under extreme environmental conditions of Mars and suggested a
combination of solar and nuclear power to account for the huge energy

<p class='card-text'>High-definition maps provide precise environmental information essential for
prediction and planning in autonomous driving systems. Due to the high cost of
labeling and maintenance, recent research has turned to online HD map
construction using onboard sensor data, offering wider coverage and more timely
updates for autonomous vehicles. However, the robustness of online map
construction under adversarial conditions remains underexplored. In this paper,
we present a systematic vulnerability analysis of online map construction
models, which reveals that these models exhibit an inherent bias toward
predicting symmetric road structures. In asymmetric scenes like forks or
merges, this bias often causes the model to mistakenly predict a straight
boundary that mirrors the opposite side. We demonstrate that this vulnerability
persists in the real-world and can be reliably triggered by obstruction or
targeted interference. Leveraging this vulnerability, we propose a novel
two-stage attack framework capable of manipulating online constructed maps.
First, our method identifies vulnerable asymmetric scenes along the victim AV's
potential route. Then, we optimize the location and pattern of camera-blinding
attacks and adversarial patch attacks. Evaluations on a public AD dataset
demonstrate that our attacks can degrade mapping accuracy by up to 9.9%, render
up to 44% of targeted routes unreachable, and increase unsafe planned
trajectory rates, colliding with real-world road boundaries, by up to 27%.
These attacks are also validated on a real-world testbed vehicle. We further
analyze root causes of the symmetry bias, attributing them to training data
imbalance, model architecture, and map element representation. To the best of
our knowledge, this study presents the first vulnerability assessment of online
map construction models and introduces the first digital and physical attack
against them.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) operate on battery power, making energy
efficiency a critical consideration, particularly in outdoor environments where
terrain variations affect energy consumption. While prior research has
primarily focused on computing energy-efficient paths from a source to a
destination, these approaches often overlook practical scenarios where a robot
needs to pick up an object en route - an action that can significantly impact
energy consumption due to changes in payload. This paper introduces the
Object-Pickup Minimum Energy Path Problem (OMEPP), which addresses
energy-efficient route planning for AMRs required to pick up an object from one
of many possible locations and deliver it to a destination. To address OMEPP,
we first introduce a baseline algorithm that employs the Z star algorithm, a
variant of A star tailored for energy-efficient routing, to iteratively visit
each pickup point. While this approach guarantees optimality, it suffers from
high computational cost due to repeated searches at each pickup location. To
mitigate this inefficiency, we propose a concurrent PCPD search that manages
multiple Z star searches simultaneously across all pickup points. Central to
our solution is the Payload-Constrained Path Database (PCPD), an extension of
the Compressed Path Database (CPD) that incorporates payload constraints. We
demonstrate that PCPD significantly reduces branching factors during search,
improving overall performance. Although the concurrent PCPD search may produce
slightly suboptimal solutions, extensive experiments on real-world datasets
show it achieves near-optimal performance while being one to two orders of
magnitude faster than the baseline algorithm.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The rapid electrification of city bus fleets offers significant environmental
benefits, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.
However, it also introduces complex challenges in energy management and
infrastructure planning for public transport operators (PTOs). This study
develops a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach to minimize
daily operational costs for electric bus (EB) networks. The model integrates
on-site photovoltaic (PV) generation, energy storage systems (ESS), and
Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) capabilities, while explicitly accounting for dynamic
electricity tariffs, peak demand charges, and battery degradation costs. A
discrete-event optimization (DEO) scheme is employed to balance computational
efficiency with operational accuracy. The framework is applied to a real-world
case in Brussels involving 28 articulated electric buses (EBs) and 232 trips
over a 24-hour horizon. A scenario-based analysis is conducted to evaluate the
impacts of the extended components. Key findings show that incorporating demand
charges into the optimization reduces daily costs by 5% and decreases the share
of peak power costs by 9%, underlining the importance of load management.
Integrating PV and ESS leads to a total net cost reduction of up to 56%, with
ESS primarily used for energy arbitrage rather than direct bus charging. V2G
participation is highly sensitive to battery degradation costs and policy
incentives: it can become economically viable under high tariff margins and
decreased replacement costs. When all extensions are combined, the model
achieves a 58% reduction in total operational expenses compared to the
baseline, highlighting the substantial value of smart (dis)charging
optimization tools for PTOs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In mathematical optimization, we want to find the best possible solution for
a decision-making problem. Curiously, these problems are harder to solve if
they have discrete decisions. Imagine that you would like to buy chocolate: you
can buy no chocolate or one chocolate bar, but typically you cannot buy just
half of a bar. Now imagine that you could also buy many other items, and that
you need to meet nutritional needs while minimizing the grocery bill. With more
options and more demands, finding the best solution becomes trickier. But since
many real-world settings benefit from mathematical optimization, such as
scheduling trains and flights, planning truck deliveries, and making better
investment decisions, these problems are widely studied in a branch of
mathematics called Operations Research (OR). Sometimes we can simply write the
mathematical model and find an optimal solution with OR software, but for
larger problems we may need to develop new mathematical models and even write

<p class='card-text'>A/B testing is a widely adopted methodology for estimating conditional
average treatment effects (CATEs) in both clinical trials and online platforms.
While most existing research has focused primarily on maximizing estimation
accuracy, practical applications must also account for additional
objectives-most notably welfare or revenue loss. In many settings, it is
critical to administer treatments that improve patient outcomes or to implement
plans that generate greater revenue from customers. Within a machine learning
framework, such objectives are naturally captured through the notion of
cumulative regret. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental trade-off
between social welfare loss and statistical accuracy in (adaptive) experiments
with heterogeneous treatment effects. We establish matching upper and lower
bounds for the resulting multi-objective optimization problem and employ the
concept of Pareto optimality to characterize the necessary and sufficient
conditions for optimal experimental designs. Beyond estimating CATEs,
practitioners often aim to deploy treatment policies that maximize welfare
across the entire population. We demonstrate that our Pareto-optimal adaptive
design achieves optimal post-experiment welfare, irrespective of the
in-experiment trade-off between accuracy and welfare. Furthermore, since
clinical and commercial data are often highly sensitive, it is essential to
incorporate robust privacy guarantees into any treatment-allocation mechanism.
To this end, we develop differentially private algorithms that continue to
achieve our established lower bounds, showing that privacy can be attained at
negligible cost.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Robot path planning is a fundamental challenge in enhancing the environmental
adaptability of autonomous navigation systems. This paper presents a hybrid
path planning algorithm, A-star PRM, which incorporates dynamic weights. By
embedding the Manhattan distance heuristic of the A-star algorithm into the
random sampling process of PRM, the algorithm achieves a balanced optimization
of path quality and computational efficiency. The approach uses a hierarchical
sampling strategy and a dynamic connection mechanism, greatly improving
adaptability to complex obstacle distributions. Experiments show that under a
baseline configuration with one thousand sampled vertices, the path length of
A-star PRM is 1073.23 plus or minus 14.8 meters and is 42.3 percent shorter
than that of PRM with p value less than 0.01. With high-density sampling using
three thousand vertices, the path length is reduced by 0.94 percent, 1036.61
meters compared with 1046.42 meters, while the increase in computational time
is cut to about one tenth of the PRM increase, 71 percent compared with 785

<p class='card-text'>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language
reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is
critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges:
(1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations
without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial
details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language
pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework
that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal
reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs,
OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory
signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly
from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit
reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance
degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and
demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks,
offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for
