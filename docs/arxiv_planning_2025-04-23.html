  Virtual Materiality</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>This paper addresses the concept of materiality in virtual environments,
which we define as being composed of objects that can influence user experience
actively. Such virtual materiality is closely related to its physical
counterpart, which is discussed in theoretical frameworks such as
sociomateriality and actor-network theory. They define phenomena in terms of
the entanglement of human and non-human elements. We report on an early
investigation of virtual materiality within the context of reflection and
perspective change in nature-based virtual environments. We considered the case
of university students reflecting on the planning and management of their
theses and major projects. Inspired by nature's known positive cognitive and
affective effects and repeated questioning processes, we established a virtual
reflection intervention to demonstrate the environmental mechanisms and
material characteristics relevant to virtual materiality. Our work is a
preliminary step toward understanding virtual materiality and its implications
for research and the design of virtual environments.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-22 14:50:09</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper presents an adaptive control approach to information-based
guidance and control of a spacecraft carrying out on-orbit inspection by
actively computing optimal policies for the spacecraft to achieve the best
possible representation of objects within its orbital environment. Due to the
complexity of navigating the space environment, it may be impossible to carry
out on-orbit servicing to maintain space systems like satellites using a
spacecraft equipped with controllers that cannot adapt to changing conditions.
In particular, the presence of constraints such as illumination, field-of-view
(FOV), minimal fuel, the use of visual-inertial navigation for improved
localization, and the need for real-time computation of control policies render
the spacecraft motion planning problem challenging. The control framework
developed in this paper addresses these challenges by formulating the
inspection task as a constrained optimization problem where the goal is to
maximize information gained from the cameras, while navigating to the next best
view, subject to illumination and FOV constraints. The developed architecture
is analyzed using a Lyapunov-based stability analysis and the effectiveness of
the planning algorithm is verified in simulation.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Mohsen Sadatsafavi, Paul Gustafson, Solmaz Setayeshgar, Laure Wynants, Richard Riley</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-22 14:07:05</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Summary: Contemporary sample size calculations for external validation of
risk prediction models require users to specify fixed values of assumed model
performance metrics alongside target precision levels (e.g., 95% CI widths).
However, due to the finite samples of previous studies, our knowledge of true
model performance in the target population is uncertain, and so choosing fixed
values represents an incomplete picture. As well, for net benefit (NB) as a
measure of clinical utility, the relevance of conventional precision-based
inference is doubtful. In this work, we propose a general Bayesian algorithm
for constructing the joint distribution of predicted risks and response values
based on summary statistics of model performance in previous studies. For
statistical metrics of performance, we propose sample size determination rules
that either target desired expected precision, or a desired assurance
probability that the precision criteria will be satisfied. For NB, we propose
rules based on optimality assurance (the probability that the planned study
correctly identifies the most beneficial strategy) and the Expected Value of
Sample Information (EVSI), the expected gain in NB from the planned validation
study. We showcase these developments in a case study on the validation of a
risk prediction model for deterioration of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Compared to the conventional sample size calculation methods, a Bayesian
approach requires explicit quantification of uncertainty around model
performance, but thereby enables various sample size rules based on expected
precision, assurance probabilities, and value of information.</p>

  Learning for Strategic Confrontation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Qizhen Wu Lei Chen, Kexin Liu, Jinhu Lü</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-22 13:22:58</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In swarm robotics, confrontation scenarios, including strategic
confrontations, require efficient decision-making that integrates discrete
commands and continuous actions. Traditional task and motion planning methods
separate decision-making into two layers, but their unidirectional structure
fails to capture the interdependence between these layers, limiting
adaptability in dynamic environments. Here, we propose a novel bidirectional
approach based on hierarchical reinforcement learning, enabling dynamic
interaction between the layers. This method effectively maps commands to task
allocation and actions to path planning, while leveraging cross-training
techniques to enhance learning across the hierarchical framework. Furthermore,
we introduce a trajectory prediction model that bridges abstract task
representations with actionable planning goals. In our experiments, it achieves
over 80\% in confrontation win rate and under 0.01 seconds in decision time,
outperforming existing approaches. Demonstrations through large-scale tests and
real-world robot experiments further emphasize the generalization capabilities
and practical applicability of our method.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Karim Essalmi, Fernando Garrido, Fawzi Nashashibi</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-22 13:11:16</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper introduces COR-MCTS (Conservation of Resources - Monte Carlo Tree
Search), a novel tactical decision-making approach for automated driving
focusing on maneuver planning over extended horizons. Traditional
decision-making algorithms are often constrained by fixed planning horizons,
typically up to 6 seconds for classical approaches and 3 seconds for
learning-based methods limiting their adaptability in particular dynamic
driving scenarios. However, planning must be done well in advance in
environments such as highways, roundabouts, and exits to ensure safe and
efficient maneuvers. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid method
integrating Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with our prior utility-based
framework, COR-MP (Conservation of Resources Model for Maneuver Planning). This
combination enables long-term, real-time decision-making, significantly
enhancing the ability to plan a sequence of maneuvers over extended horizons.
Through simulations across diverse driving scenarios, we demonstrate that
COR-MCTS effectively improves planning robustness and decision efficiency over
extended horizons.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In autonomous driving, accurately predicting the movements of other traffic
participants is crucial, as it significantly influences a vehicle's planning
processes. Modern trajectory prediction models strive to interpret complex
patterns and dependencies from agent and map data. The Motion Transformer (MTR)
architecture and subsequent work define the most accurate methods in common
benchmarks such as the Waymo Open Motion Benchmark. The MTR model employs
pre-generated static intention points as initial goal points for trajectory
prediction. However, the static nature of these points frequently leads to
misalignment with map data in specific traffic scenarios, resulting in
unfeasible or unrealistic goal points. Our research addresses this limitation
by integrating scene-specific dynamic intention points into the MTR model. This
adaptation of the MTR model was trained and evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion
Dataset. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating dynamic intention points
has a significant positive impact on trajectory prediction accuracy, especially
for predictions over long time horizons. Furthermore, we analyze the impact on
ground truth trajectories which are not compliant with the map data or are
illegal maneuvers.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-22 07:54:05</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The energy transition is driving rapid growth in renewable energy generation,
creating the need to balance energy supply and demand with energy price
awareness. One such approach for manufacturers to balance their energy demand
with available energy is energyaware production planning. Through energy-aware
production planning, manufacturers can align their energy demand with dynamic
grid conditions, supporting renewable energy integration while benefiting from
lower prices and reduced emissions. Energy-aware production planning can be
modeled as a multi-criteria scheduling problem, where the objectives extend
beyond traditional metrics like makespan or required workers to also include
minimizing energy costs and emissions. Due to market dynamics and the NP-hard
multi-objective nature of the problem, evolutionary algorithms are widely used
for energy-aware scheduling. However, existing research focuses on the design
and analysis of single algorithms, with limited comparisons between different
approaches. In this study, we adapt NSGA-III, HypE, and $\theta$-DEA as memetic
metaheuristics for energy-aware scheduling to minimize makespan, energy costs,
emissions, and the number of workers, within a real-time energy market context.
These adapted metaheuristics present different approaches for environmental
selection. In a comparative analysis, we explore differences in solution
efficiency and quality across various scenarios which are based on benchmark
instances from the literature and real-world energy market data. Additionally,
we estimate upper bounds on the distance between objective values obtained with
our memetic metaheuristics and reference sets obtained via an exact solver.</p>

  Planning Problems</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-22 07:45:30</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Explaining unsolvability of planning problems is of significant research
interest in Explainable AI Planning. AI planning literature has reported
several research efforts on generating explanations of solutions to planning
problems. However, explaining the unsolvability of planning problems remains a
largely open and understudied problem. A widely practiced approach to plan
generation and automated problem solving, in general, is to decompose tasks
into sub-problems that help progressively converge towards the goal. In this
paper, we propose to adopt the same philosophy of sub-problem identification as
a mechanism for analyzing and explaining unsolvability of planning problems in
hybrid systems. In particular, for a given unsolvable planning problem, we
propose to identify common waypoints, which are universal obstacles to plan
existence; in other words, they appear on every plan from the source to the
planning goal. This work envisions such waypoints as sub-problems of the
planning problem and the unreachability of any of these waypoints as an
explanation for the unsolvability of the original planning problem. We propose
a novel method of waypoint identification by casting the problem as an instance
of the longest common subsequence problem, a widely popular problem in computer
science, typically considered as an illustrative example for the dynamic
programming paradigm. Once the waypoints are identified, we perform symbolic
reachability analysis on them to identify the earliest unreachable waypoint and
report it as the explanation of unsolvability. We present experimental results
on unsolvable planning problems in hybrid domains.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Automated driving on ramps presents significant challenges due to the need to
balance both safety and efficiency during lane changes. This paper proposes an
integrated planner for automated vehicles (AVs) on ramps, utilizing an
unsatisfactory level metric for efficiency and arrow-cluster-based sampling for
safety. The planner identifies optimal times for the AV to change lanes, taking
into account the vehicle's velocity as a key factor in efficiency.
Additionally, the integrated planner employs arrow-cluster-based sampling to
evaluate collision risks and select an optimal lane-changing curve. Extensive
simulations were conducted in a ramp scenario to verify the planner's efficient
and safe performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed planner can
effectively select an appropriate lane-changing time point and a safe
lane-changing curve for AVs, without incurring any collisions during the

imaging with the highest ever spatial resolution to enable detection of the
photon ring of a supermassive black hole. BHEX is being proposed for launch in
2031 as a NASA Small Explorers mission. BHEX science goals and mission
opportunity require a high precision lightweight spaceborne antenna. A survey

Technology readiness (TRL) for the antenna is discussed and assessed to be at
TRL 5. An update on our technology maturation efforts is provided. Design
studies leading to the conceptual design of a metallized carbon fiber

<p class='card-text'>This paper introduces MRTA-Sim, a Python/ROS2/Gazebo simulator for testing
approaches to Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problems on simulated robots
in complex, indoor environments. Grid-based approaches to MRTA problems can be
too restrictive for use in complex, dynamic environments such in warehouses,
department stores, hospitals, etc. However, approaches that operate in
free-space often operate at a layer of abstraction above the control and
planning layers of a robot and make an assumption on approximate travel time
between points of interest in the system. These abstractions can neglect the
impact of the tight space and multi-agent interactions on the quality of the
solution. Therefore, MRTA solutions should be tested with the navigation stacks
of the robots in mind, taking into account robot planning, conflict avoidance
between robots, and human interaction and avoidance. This tool connects the
allocation output of MRTA solvers to individual robot planning using the NAV2
stack and local, centralized multi-robot deconfliction using Control Barrier
Function-Quadrtic Programs (CBF-QPs), creating a platform closer to real-world
operation for more comprehensive testing of these approaches. The simulation
architecture is modular so that users can swap out methods at different levels
of the stack. We show the use of our system with a Satisfiability Modulo

<p class='card-text'>Multi-view understanding, the ability to reconcile visual information across
diverse viewpoints for effective navigation, manipulation, and 3D scene
comprehension, is a fundamental challenge in Multi-Modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to be used as embodied agents. While recent MLLMs have shown impressive
advances in high-level reasoning and planning, they frequently fall short when
confronted with multi-view geometric consistency and cross-view correspondence.
To comprehensively evaluate the challenges of MLLMs in multi-view scene
reasoning, we propose All-Angles Bench, a benchmark of over 2,100 human
carefully annotated multi-view question-answer pairs across 90 diverse
real-world scenes. Our six tasks (counting, attribute identification, relative
distance, relative direction, object manipulation, and camera pose estimation)
specifically test model's geometric correspondence and the capacity to align
information consistently across views. Our extensive experiments, benchmark on
27 representative MLLMs including Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and
GPT-4o against human evaluators reveals a substantial performance gap,
indicating that current MLLMs remain far from human-level proficiency. Through
in-depth analysis, we show that MLLMs are particularly underperforming under
two aspects: (1) cross-view correspondence for partially occluded views and (2)
establishing the coarse camera poses. These findings highlight the necessity of
domain-specific refinements or modules that embed stronger multi-view
awareness. We believe that our All-Angles Bench offers valuable insights and
contribute to bridging the gap between MLLMs and human-level multi-view
understanding. The project and benchmark are publicly available at

<p class='card-text'>We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction
of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably
quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like
real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our
tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a)
discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay,
drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in
designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and
conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic and memorizes excessively;
comparatively, multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and
diffusion models, excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, in
our tasks, we find that to elicit randomness from the Transformer without
hurting coherence, it is better to inject noise right at the input layer (via a
method we dub hash-conditioning) rather than defer to temperature sampling from
the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for
analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond
next-token learning and softmax-based sampling. We make part of the code

<p class='card-text'>Modern power systems face growing risks from cyber-physical attacks,
necessitating enhanced resilience due to their societal function as critical

systems-of-systems requires scalability in their threat and risk assessment
environment for cyber physical analysis including cyber-informed transmission
planning, decision-making, and intrusion response. Hence, we present a scalable
discrete event simulation tool for analysis of energy systems, called DESTinE.
The tool is tailored for largescale cyber-physical systems, with a focus on
power systems. It supports faster-than-real-time traffic generation and models
packet flow and congestion under both normal and adversarial conditions. Using
three well-established power system synthetic cases with 500, 2000, and 10,000
buses, we overlay a constructed cyber network employing star and radial
topologies. Experiments are conducted to identify critical nodes within a
communication network in response to a disturbance. The findings are
incorporated into a constrained optimization problem to assess the impact of
the disturbance on a specific node and its cascading effects on the overall
network. Based on the solution of the optimization problem, a new hybrid
network topology is also derived, combining the strengths of star and radial
structures to improve network resilience. Furthermore, DESTinE is integrated
with a virtual server and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system using Raspberry

<p class='card-text'>Deploying robot learning methods to a quadrotor in unstructured outdoor
environments is an exciting task. Quadrotors operating in real-world
environments by learning-based methods encounter several challenges: a large
amount of simulator generated data required for training, strict demands for
real-time processing onboard, and the sim-to-real gap caused by dynamic and
noisy conditions. Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying
learning-based methods to end-to-end control of quadrotors, but rarely mention
the infrastructure system training from scratch and deploying to reality, which
makes it difficult to reproduce methods and applications. To bridge this gap,
we propose a platform that enables the seamless transfer of end-to-end deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We integrate the training environment,
flight dynamics control, DRL algorithms, the MAVROS middleware stack, and
hardware into a comprehensive workflow and architecture that enables
quadrotors' policies to be trained from scratch to real-world deployment in
several minutes. Our platform provides rich types of environments including
hovering, dynamic obstacle avoidance, trajectory tracking, balloon hitting, and
planning in unknown environments, as a physical experiment benchmark. Through
extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate the efficiency of proposed
sim-to-real platform, and robust outdoor flight performance under real-world
perturbations. Details can be found from our website

<p class='card-text'>In interactions between automated vehicles (AVs) and crossing pedestrians,
modeling implicit vehicle communication is crucial. In this work, we present a
combined prediction and planning approach that allows to consider the influence
of the planned vehicle behavior on a pedestrian and predict a pedestrian's
reaction. We plan the behavior by solving two consecutive optimal control
problems (OCPs) analytically, using variational calculus. We perform a
validation step that assesses whether the planned vehicle behavior is adequate
to trigger a certain pedestrian reaction, which accounts for the closed-loop
characteristics of prediction and planning influencing each other. In this
step, we model the influence of the planned vehicle behavior on the pedestrian
using a probabilistic behavior acceptance model that returns an estimate for
the crossing probability. The probabilistic modeling of the pedestrian reaction
facilitates considering the pedestrian's costs, thereby improving cooperative
behavior planning. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in
simulated vehicle-pedestrian interactions with varying initial settings and
highlight the decision making capabilities of the planning approach.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-21 13:23:48</h6>
<p class='card-text'>A new class of Multi-Rotor Aerial Vehicles (MRAVs), known as omnidirectional
MRAVs (o-MRAVs), has gained attention for their ability to independently
control 3D position and orientation. This capability enhances robust planning
and control in aerial communication networks, enabling more adaptive trajectory
planning and precise antenna alignment without additional mechanical
components. These features are particularly valuable in uncertain environments,
where disturbances such as wind and interference affect communication
stability. This paper examines o-MRAVs in the context of robust aerial network
planning, comparing them with the more common under-actuated MRAVs (u-MRAVs).
Key applications, including physical layer security, optical communications,
and network densification, are highlighted, demonstrating the potential of
o-MRAVs to improve reliability and efficiency in dynamic communication

<p class='card-text'>We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must
choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce
uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as
separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active
inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, offers such a foundation by
minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility
with epistemic drives like ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However,
the computational burden of EFE minimization has remained a major obstacle to
its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises
naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative
model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces
theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle, by casting planning
itself as variational inference. Our formulation yields optimal policies that
jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a
complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This
unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable,
resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Communication is fundamental for multi-robot collaboration, with accurate
radio mapping playing a crucial role in predicting signal strength between
robots. However, modeling radio signal propagation in large and occluded
environments is challenging due to complex interactions between signals and
obstacles. Existing methods face two key limitations: they struggle to predict
signal strength for transmitter-receiver pairs not present in the training set,
while also requiring extensive manual data collection for modeling, making them
impractical for large, obstacle-rich scenarios. To overcome these limitations,
we propose FERMI, a flexible radio mapping framework. FERMI combines
physics-based modeling of direct signal paths with a neural network to capture
environmental interactions with radio signals. This hybrid model learns radio
signal propagation more efficiently, requiring only sparse training data.
Additionally, FERMI introduces a scalable planning method for autonomous data
collection using a multi-robot team. By increasing parallelism in data
collection and minimizing robot travel costs between regions, overall data
collection efficiency is significantly improved. Experiments in both simulation
and real-world scenarios demonstrate that FERMI enables accurate signal
prediction and generalizes well to unseen positions in complex environments. It
also supports fully autonomous data collection and scales to different team
sizes, offering a flexible solution for creating radio maps. Our code is

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-20 21:41:29</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Hierarchical composite endpoints, such as those analyzed using the
Finkelstein-Schoenfeld (FS) statistic, are increasingly used in clinical trials
for their ability to incorporate clinically prioritized outcomes. However,
adaptive design methods for these endpoints remain underdeveloped. This paper
presents a practical framework for implementing sample size re-estimation (SSR)
in trials using hierarchical composites, motivated by a cardiovascular trial
with mortality, hospitalization, and a functional response as prioritized
endpoints. We use a two-stage adaptive design with a single interim analysis
for illustration. The interim analysis incorporates predictive probabilities to
determine whether the trial should stop for futility, continue as planned, or
increase the sample size to maintain power. The decision framework is based on
predefined zones for predictive probability, with corresponding adjustments to
the stage 2 sample size. Simulation studies across various treatment scenarios
demonstrate strong type I error control and increased power compared to a fixed
design, particularly for treatment effects that are clinically relevant but
lower than the alternative hypothesis. We also explore an alternative
conditional power approach for SSR, offering further sample size optimization.
Our results support the use of SSR with hierarchical composite outcomes using
an FS statistic, enhancing trial efficiency.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous driving has garnered significant attention for its potential to
improve safety, traffic efficiency, and user convenience. However, the dynamic
and complex nature of interactive driving poses significant challenges,
including the need to navigate non-linear road geometries, handle dynamic
obstacles, and meet stringent safety and comfort requirements. Traditional
approaches, such as artificial potential fields (APF), often fall short in
addressing these complexities independently, necessitating the development of
integrated and adaptive frameworks. This paper presents a novel approach to
autonomous vehicle navigation that integrates artificial potential fields,
Frenet coordinates, and improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO). A dynamic
risk field, adapted from traditional APF, is proposed to ensure interactive
safety by quantifying risks and dynamically adjusting lane-changing intentions
based on surrounding vehicle behavior. Frenet coordinates are utilized to
simplify trajectory planning on non-straight roads, while an enhanced quintic
polynomial trajectory generator ensures smooth and comfortable path
transitions. Additionally, an IPSO algorithm optimizes trajectory selection in
real time, balancing safety and user comfort within a feasible input range. The
proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world
scenarios, demonstrating its ability to navigate complex traffic environments,
maintain safety margins, and generate smooth, dynamically feasible
trajectories.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate and efficient medical image segmentation is crucial for advancing
clinical diagnostics and surgical planning, yet remains a complex challenge due
to the variability in anatomical structures and the demand for low-complexity
models. In this paper, we introduced Med-2D SegNet, a novel and highly
efficient segmentation architecture that delivers outstanding accuracy while
maintaining a minimal computational footprint. Med-2D SegNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including
KVASIR-SEG, PH2, EndoVis, and GLAS, with an average Dice similarity coefficient
(DSC) of 89.77% across 20 diverse datasets. Central to its success is the
compact Med Block, a specialized encoder design that incorporates dimension
expansion and parameter reduction, enabling precise feature extraction while
keeping model parameters to a low count of just 2.07 million. Med-2D SegNet
excels in cross-dataset generalization, particularly in polyp segmentation,
where it was trained on KVASIR-SEG and showed strong performance on unseen
datasets, demonstrating its robustness in zero-shot learning scenarios, even
though we acknowledge that further improvements are possible. With top-tier
performance in both binary and multi-class segmentation, Med-2D SegNet
redefines the balance between accuracy and efficiency, setting a new benchmark

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-20 18:51:26</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Machine learning (ML)-based planners have recently gained significant
attention. They offer advantages over traditional optimization-based planning
algorithms. These advantages include fewer manually selected parameters and
faster development. Within ML-based planning, imitation learning (IL) is a
common algorithm. It primarily learns driving policies directly from supervised
trajectory data. While IL has demonstrated strong performance on many open-loop
benchmarks, it remains challenging to determine if the learned policy truly
understands fundamental driving principles, rather than simply extrapolating
from the ego-vehicle's initial state. Several studies have identified this
limitation and proposed algorithms to address it. However, these methods often
use original datasets for evaluation. In these datasets, future trajectories
are heavily dependent on initial conditions. Furthermore, IL often overfits to
the most common scenarios. It struggles to generalize to rare or unseen
situations.
  To address these challenges, this work proposes: 1) a novel closed-loop
simulator supporting both imitation and reinforcement learning, 2) a causal
benchmark derived from the Waymo Open Dataset to rigorously assess the impact
of the copycat problem, and 3) a novel framework integrating imitation learning
and reinforcement learning to overcome the limitations of purely imitative
approaches. The code for this work will be released soon.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The moving target traveling salesman problem with obstacles (MT-TSP-O) seeks
an obstacle-free trajectory for an agent that intercepts a given set of moving
targets, each within specified time windows, and returns to the agent's
starting position. Each target moves with a constant velocity within its time
windows, and the agent has a speed limit no smaller than any target's speed. We
present FMC*-TSP, the first complete and bounded-suboptimal algorithm for the
MT-TSP-O, and results for an agent whose configuration space is $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Our algorithm interleaves a high-level search and a low-level search, where the
high-level search solves a generalized traveling salesman problem with time
windows (GTSP-TW) to find a sequence of targets and corresponding time windows
for the agent to visit. Given such a sequence, the low-level search then finds
an associated agent trajectory. To solve the low-level planning problem, we
develop a new algorithm called FMC*, which finds a shortest path on a graph of
convex sets (GCS) via implicit graph search and pruning techniques specialized
for problems with moving targets. We test FMC*-TSP on 280 problem instances
with up to 40 targets and demonstrate its smaller median runtime than a
baseline based on prior work.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Traditional urban planning methodologies often fail to capture the complexity
of contemporary urbanization and environmental sustainability challenges. This
study investigates the integration of Generative Design, Virtual Reality (VR),
and Digital Twins (DT) to enhance walkability in urban planning. VR provides
distinct benefits over conventional approaches, including 2D maps, static

iterative improvements. Preliminary findings from structured interviews with
Eindhoven residents provide critical insights into pedestrian preferences and

development of VR-DT integrated prototypes to simulate urban environments,
assess walkability, and explore the role of Generative Design in generating
adaptive urban planning solutions. The objective is to develop a
decision-support tool that enables urban planners to incorporate diverse

the gap by proposing machine learning (ML)-based approaches for pre-flight

<p class='card-text'>In automated web testing, generating test scripts from natural language task
descriptions is crucial for enhancing the test generation process. This
activity involves creating the correct sequences of actions to form test
scripts for future testing activities. Current state-of-the-art approaches are
limited in generating these action sequences, as they either demand substantial
manual effort for human demonstrations or fail to consider the history of
previous web content and actions to decide the next action. In this paper, we
introduce HxAgent, an iterative large language model agent planning approach
that determines the next action based on: 1) observations of the current
contents and feasible actions, 2) short-term memory of previous web states and
actions, and 3) long-term experience with (in)correct action sequences. The
agent generates a sequence of actions to perform a given task, which is
effectively an automated test case to verify the task. We conducted an
extensive empirical evaluation of HxAgent using two datasets. On the MiniWoB++
dataset, our approach achieves 97% exact-match accuracy that is comparable to
the best baselines while eliminating the need for human demonstrations required
by those methods. For complex tasks requiring navigation through multiple
actions and screens, HxAgent achieves an average 82% exact-match. On the second
dataset, comprising 350 task instances across seven popular websites, including
YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google, HxAgent achieves high performance,
with 87% of the action sequences exactly matching the ground truth and a
