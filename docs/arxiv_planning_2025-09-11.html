<p class='card-text'>Model-free diffusion planners have shown great promise for robot motion
planning, but practical robotic systems often require combining them with
model-based optimization modules to enforce constraints, such as safety.
Naively integrating these modules presents compatibility challenges when
diffusion's multi-modal outputs behave adversarially to optimization-based
modules. To address this, we introduce Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion
(JM2D), a novel generative modeling framework. JM2D formulates module
integration as a joint sampling problem to maximize compatibility via an
interaction potential, without additional training. Using importance sampling,
JM2D guides modules outputs based only on evaluations of the interaction
potential, thus handling non-differentiable objectives commonly arising from
non-convex optimization modules. We evaluate JM2D via application to aligning
diffusion planners with safety modules on offline RL and robot manipulation.
JM2D significantly improves task performance compared to conventional safety
filters without sacrificing safety. Further, we show that conditional
generation is a special case of JM2D and elucidate key design choices by
comparing with SOTA gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.

window on the universe. These cavity-enhanced laser interferometers sense
spacetime strain, generated by distant astrophysical events such as black hole
mergers, to an RMS fluctuation of a few parts in $10^{21}$ over a
multi-kilometer baseline. Optical advancements in laser wavefront control are
key to advancing the sensitivity of current detectors and enabling a planned
next-generation 40-km gravitational wave observatory in the United States,
known as Cosmic Explorer. We report the first experimental demonstration of a
new wavefront control technique for gravitational-wave detection, obtained from
testing a full-scale prototype on a 40-kg LIGO mirror. Our results indicate
that this design can meet the unique and challenging requirements of providing
higher-order precision wavefront corrections at megawatt laser power levels,
while introducing extremely low effective displacement noise into the

<p class='card-text'>Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D
maps or learned controllers, which can be computationally expensive and
difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a
novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables
zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or
pre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path
planning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate
towards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key
limitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory
using monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an
auto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when
necessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set
applicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world
tests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective
solution for visual navigation in open-set environments. The source code is

of our framework is a hybrid GNN-POMDP architecture that processes
graph-structured representations of entangled links to learn routing policies,

<p class='card-text'>Using inverse planning tools to create radiotherapy treatment plans is an
iterative process, where clinical trade-offs are explored by changing the
relative importance of different objectives and rerunning the optimizer until a
desirable plan is found. We seek to optimize hundreds of radiosurgery treatment
plans, corresponding to different weightings of objectives, fast enough to
incorporate interactive Pareto navigation of clinical trade-offs into the
clinical workflow. We apply the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) to the linear-program formulation of the optimization problem used in
Lightning. We implement both a CPU and a GPU version of ADMM in Matlab and
compare them to Matlab's built-in, single-threaded dual-simplex solver. The
ADMM implementation is adapted to the optimization procedure used in the
clinical software, with a bespoke algorithm for maximizing overlap between
low-dose points for different objective weights. The method is evaluated on a
test dataset consisting of 20 cases from three different indications, with
between one and nine targets and total target volumes ranging from 0.66 to 52
cm3, yielding speedups of 1.6-97 and 54-1500 times on CPU and GPU,
respectively, compared to simplex. Plan quality was evaluated by rerunning the
ADMM optimization 20 times, each with a different random seed, for each test
case and for nine objective weightings per case. The resulting clinical metrics
closely mimicked those obtained when rerunning the simplex solver, verifying
the validity of the method. In conclusion, we show how ADMM can be adapted for
radiosurgery plan optimization, allowing hundreds of high-quality Gamma Knife
treatment plans to be created in under two minutes on a single GPU, also for
very large cases.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload

at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the

  Marching Tree for Dynamic Replanning</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-10 11:57:56</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Path planning in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in robotics,
especially as autonomous systems are deployed in unpredictable spaces such as
warehouses and public roads. While algorithms like Fast Marching Tree
(FMT$^{*}$) offer asymptotically optimal solutions in static settings, their
single-pass design prevents path revisions which are essential for real-time
adaptation. On the other hand, full replanning is often too computationally
expensive. This paper introduces FMT$^{x}$, an extension of the Fast Marching
Tree algorithm that enables efficient and consistent replanning in dynamic
environments. We revisit the neighbor selection rule of FMT$^{*}$ and
demonstrate that a minimal change overcomes its single-pass limitation,
enabling the algorithm to update cost-to-come values upon discovering better
connections without sacrificing asymptotic optimality or computational
efficiency. By maintaining a cost-ordered priority queue and applying a
selective update condition that uses an expanding neighbor to identify and
trigger the re-evaluation of any node with a potentially suboptimal path,
FMT$^{x}$ ensures that suboptimal routes are efficiently repaired as the
environment evolves. This targeted strategy preserves the inherent efficiency
of FMT$^{*}$ while enabling robust adaptation to changes in obstacle
configuration. FMT$^{x}$ is proven to recover an asymptotically optimal
solution after environmental changes. Experimental results demonstrate that
FMT$^{x}$ outperforms the influential replanner RRT$^{x}$, reacting more
swiftly to dynamic events with lower computational overhead and thus offering a
more effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable
worlds.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In this paper, we present our localization method called CLAP, Clustering to
Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which helped us win the RoboCup 2024
adult-sized autonomous humanoid soccer competition. Competition rules limited
our sensor suite to stereo vision and an inertial sensor, similar to humans. In
addition, our robot had to deal with varying lighting conditions, dynamic
feature occlusions, noise from high-impact stepping, and mistaken features from
bystanders and neighboring fields. Therefore, we needed an accurate, and most
importantly robust localization algorithm that would be the foundation for our
path-planning and game-strategy algorithms. CLAP achieves these requirements by
clustering estimated states of our robot from pairs of field features to
localize its global position and orientation. Correct state estimates naturally
cluster together, while incorrect estimates spread apart, making CLAP resilient
to noise and incorrect inputs. CLAP is paired with a particle filter and an
extended Kalman filter to improve consistency and smoothness. Tests of CLAP
with other landmark-based localization methods showed similar accuracy.
However, tests with increased false positive feature detection showed that CLAP
outperformed other methods in terms of robustness with very little divergence

paradigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and
creates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome

enables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from
environmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our
core innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function

superior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional

multiple candidate policies--arising from different modeling paradigms--exhibit
heterogeneous performance across the covariate space, with no single policy
uniformly dominating. We propose Prescribe-then-Select (PS), a modular
framework that first constructs a library of feasible candidate policies and
then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for the observed
covariates. We implement the meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy
Trees trained via cross-validation on the training set, making policy choice

<p class='card-text'>Multi-arm motion planning is fundamental for enabling arms to complete

reducing their reliance on massive multi-arm datasets. Recognizing that
collisions are primarily pairwise, we train two conditional diffusion models,
one to generate feasible single-arm trajectories, and a second, to model the

<p class='card-text'>Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous
environments, especially when multiple agents must coordinate using just visual
inputs over extended time horizons. Traditional planning methods excel at
solving long-horizon tasks but rely on predefined distance metrics, while safe
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors using high-dimensional
inputs yet struggles with multi-agent, goal-conditioned scenarios. Recent work
combined these paradigms by leveraging goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) to build an
intermediate graph from replay buffer states, pruning unsafe edges, and using
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) for multi-agent path planning. Although effective,
this graph-pruning approach can be overly conservative, limiting mission
efficiency by precluding missions that must traverse high-risk regions. To
address this limitation, we propose RB-CBS, a novel extension to CBS that
dynamically allocates and adjusts user-specified risk bound ($\Delta$) across
agents to flexibly trade off safety and speed. Our improved planner ensures
that each agent receives a local risk budget ($\delta$) enabling more efficient
navigation while still respecting overall safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that this iterative risk-allocation framework yields
superior performance in complex environments, allowing multiple agents to find
collision-free paths within the user-specified $\Delta$.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Federated Learning (FL) is a novel, multidisciplinary Machine Learning
paradigm where multiple clients, such as mobile devices, collaborate to solve
machine learning problems. Initially introduced in Kone{\v{c}}n{\'y} et al.
(2016a,b); McMahan et al. (2017), FL has gained further attention through its
inclusion in the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023
Update) of the United States (Science and on Artificial Intelligence, 2023).
The FL training process is inherently decentralized and often takes place in
less controlled settings compared to data centers, posing unique challenges
distinct from those in fully controlled environments. In this thesis, we
identify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches
to address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and
devices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.
Moreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse
forms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.
Our contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical
advancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a
guide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical
methods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,
it offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical
implementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse
process is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to
examine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,
often uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study.</p>

<p class='card-text'>I present spherical (https://github.com/m-samland/spherical), a software
package and database designed for the ESO VLT/SPHERE high-contrast imager.
SPHERE has produced the world's largest archive of direct imaging observations
of exoplanets and circumstellar disks, but its heterogeneous metadata and
fragmented reduction tools make end-to-end analysis labor-intensive. spherical
addresses this by combining (1) a curated, regularly updated, and searchable
database of all SPHERE observations, cross-matched with stellar properties and
observing conditions, and (2) a Python-based, script-driven pipeline for the
Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS). The database, archived on Zenodo
(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15147730) and reproducible from the ESO
archive, currently includes about 6000 IRDIS dual-band imaging, about 1000
IRDIS polarimetric, and about 4500 IFS sequences, with additional modes
(ZIMPOL, IRDIS-LSS, SAM) planned. The pipeline automates raw data retrieval,
calibration, and IFS reduction with the adapted open-source CHARIS instrument
pipeline, followed by astrometric and photometric calibration and
post-processing with TRAP for companion detection and spectral extraction.
spherical lowers the barrier from raw files to science-ready products, enabling
homogeneous population studies, atmospheric characterization of companions, and
efficient survey follow-up, while remaining interoperable with community tools
such as VIP, pyKLIP, and IRDAP.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Patient-specific computational models of the heart are powerful tools for
cardiovascular research and medicine, with demonstrated applications in
treatment planning, device evaluation, and surgical decision-making. Yet
constructing such models is inherently difficult, reflecting the extraordinary
complexity of the heart itself. Numerous considerations are required, including
reconstructing the anatomy from medical images, representing myocardial
mesostructure, capturing material behavior, defining model geometry and
boundary conditions, coupling multiple physics, and selecting numerical
methods. Many of these choices involve a tradeoff between physiological
fidelity and modeling complexity. In this review, we summarize recent advances
and unresolved questions in each of these areas, with particular emphasis on
cardiac tissue mechanics. We argue that clarifying which complexities are
essential, and which can be safely simplified, will be key to enabling clinical
translation of these models.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Many robotic manipulation tasks require sensing and responding to force
signals such as torque to assess whether the task has been successfully
completed and to enable closed-loop control. However, current
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle
physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to
bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating
torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate
several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque
adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the
encoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in
autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which
further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a
physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation

<p class='card-text'>In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves
competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task
environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of
ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available

assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD

<p class='card-text'>Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Efficient exploration of unknown environments is crucial for autonomous
robots, especially in confined and large-scale scenarios with limited
communication. To address this challenge, we propose a collaborative
exploration framework for a marsupial ground-aerial robot team that leverages
the complementary capabilities of both platforms. The framework employs a
graph-based path planning algorithm to guide exploration and deploy the aerial
robot in areas where its expected gain significantly exceeds that of the ground
robot, such as large open spaces or regions inaccessible to the ground
platform, thereby maximizing coverage and efficiency. To facilitate large-scale
spatial information sharing, we introduce a bandwidth-efficient, task-driven
map compression strategy. This method enables each robot to reconstruct
resolution-specific volumetric maps while preserving exploration-critical
details, even at high compression rates. By selectively compressing and sharing
key data, communication overhead is minimized, ensuring effective map
integration for collaborative path planning. Simulation and real-world
experiments validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in
improving exploration efficiency while significantly reducing data

<p class='card-text'>In robots task and motion planning (TAMP), it is crucial to sample within the
robot's configuration space to meet task-level global constraints and enhance
the efficiency of subsequent motion planning. Due to the complexity of joint
configuration sampling under multi-level constraints, traditional methods often
lack efficiency. This paper introduces the principle of RobKiNet, a
kinematics-informed neural network, for end-to-end sampling within the
Continuous Feasible Set (CFS) under multiple constraints in configuration
space, establishing its Optimization Expectation Model. Comparisons with
traditional sampling and learning-based approaches reveal that RobKiNet's
kinematic knowledge infusion enhances training efficiency by ensuring stable
and accurate gradient optimization.Visualizations and quantitative analyses in
a 2-DOF space validate its theoretical efficiency, while its application on a
9-DOF autonomous mobile manipulator robot(AMMR) demonstrates superior
whole-body and decoupled control, excelling in battery disassembly tasks.
RobKiNet outperforms deep reinforcement learning with a training speed 74.29
times faster and a sampling accuracy of up to 99.25%, achieving a 97.33% task

<p class='card-text'>Clinical trials with time-to-event endpoints, such as overall survival (OS)
or progression-free survival (PFS), are fundamental for evaluating new
treatments, particularly in immuno-oncology. However, modern therapies, such as
immunotherapies and targeted treatments, often exhibit delayed effects that
challenge traditional trial designs. These delayed effects violate the
proportional hazards assumption, which underpins standard statistical methods
like the Cox proportional hazards model and the log-rank test. Careful planning
is essential to ensure trials are appropriately designed to account for the
timing and magnitude of these effects. Without this planning, interim analyses
may lead to premature trial termination if the treatment effect is
underestimated early in the study. We present an adaptive trial design
framework that incorporates prior distributions, elicited from experts, for
delayed treatment effects. By addressing the uncertainty surrounding delayed
treatment effects, our approach enhances trial efficiency and robustness,
minimizing the risk of premature termination and improving the detection of
treatment benefits over time. We present an example illustrating how interim
analyses, informed by prior distributions, can guide early stopping decisions.
To facilitate the implementation of our framework, we have developed free,
open-source software that enables researchers to integrate prior distributions
into trial planning and decision-making. This software provides a flexible,
accessible tool for designing trials that more accurately evaluate modern
therapies through adaptive trial designs.</p>
