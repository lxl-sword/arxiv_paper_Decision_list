<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has attracted considerable attention due to its potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on frequent exchanges of action or state information among agents to achieve effective coordination, which is difficult to satisfy in practical robotic systems. A common solution is to introduce estimator networks to model the behaviors of other agents and predict their actions; nevertheless, such designs cause the size and computational cost of the estimator networks to grow rapidly with the number of agents, thereby limiting scalability in large-scale systems.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multiagent learning framework augmented with a Collective Influence Estimation Network (CIEN). By explicitly modeling the collective influence of other agents on the task object, each agent can infer critical interaction information solely from its local observations and the task object's states, enabling efficient collaboration without explicit action information exchange. The proposed framework effectively avoids network expansion as the team size increases; moreover, new agents can be incorporated without modifying the network structures of existing agents, demonstrating strong scalability. Experimental results on multiagent cooperative tasks based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm show that the proposed method achieves stable and efficient coordination under communication-limited environments. Furthermore, policies trained with collective influence modeling are deployed on a real robotic platform, where experimental results indicate significantly improved robustness and deployment feasibility, along with reduced dependence on communication infrastructure.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and task-to-core allocation are critical for thermal management and balancing energy and performance in embedded systems. Existing approaches either rely on utilization-based heuristics that overlook stall times, or require extensive offline profiling for table generation, preventing runtime adaptation. We propose a model-based hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for thermal- and energy-aware scheduling on multi-core platforms. Two collaborative agents decompose the exponential action space, achieving 358ms latency for subsequent decisions. First decisions require 3.5 to 8.0s including one-time LLM feature extraction. An accurate environment model leverages regression techniques to predict thermal dynamics and performance states. When combined with LLM-extracted semantic features, the environment model enables zero-shot deployment for new workloads on trained platforms by generating synthetic training data without requiring workload-specific profiling samples. We introduce LLM-based semantic feature extraction that characterizes OpenMP programs through 13 code-level features without execution. The Dyna-Q-inspired framework integrates direct reinforcement learning with model-based planning, achieving 20x faster convergence than model-free methods. Experiments on BOTS and PolybenchC benchmarks across NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RubikPi, and Intel Core i7 demonstrate 7.09x better energy efficiency and 4.0x better makespan than Linux ondemand governor. First-decision latency is 8,300x faster than table-based profiling, enabling practical deployment in dynamic embedded systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to solve cooperative decision-making problems in multi-agent systems using pre-collected datasets. Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Achieving robust coordination and cooperation is a central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Uncovering the mechanisms underlying such emergent behaviors calls for a dynamical understanding of learn processes. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of actor-critic agents in stochastic games, focusing on the impact of entropy regularization. By leveraging time-scale separation, we derive the system's evolution equations, which are then formally analyzed using dynamical systems theory. We find that in the constant-sum game of Matching Pennies, the system exhibits chaotic behavior. Entropy regularization mitigates this chaos and drives the dynamics toward convergence to fair cooperation. In contrast, in the general-sum game of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the system displays multistability. Interestingly, the three stable equilibria of the system correspond to the well-known ALLC (Always Cooperate), ALLD (Always Defect), and GRIM (Grim Trigger) strategies from evolutionary game theory (EGT). Entropy regularization strengthens system resilience by enlarging the basin of attraction of the cooperative equilibrium. Our findings reveal a close link between the mechanism of direct reciprocity in EGT and how cooperation emerges in MARL, offering insights for designing more robust and collaborative multi-agent systems.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2026-01-10 21:28:41</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent systems face a fundamental coordination problem: agents must coordinate despite heterogeneous preferences, asymmetric stakes, and imperfect information. When coordination fails, friction emerges: measurable resistance manifesting as deadlock, thrashing, communication overhead, or outright conflict. This paper derives a formal framework for analyzing coordination friction from a single axiom: actions affecting agents require authorization from those agents in proportion to stakes.
  From this axiom of consent, we establish the kernel triple $(α, σ, ε)$ (alignment, stake, and entropy) characterizing any resource allocation configuration. The friction equation $F = σ (1 + ε)/(1 + α)$ predicts coordination difficulty as a function of preference alignment $α$, stake magnitude $σ$, and communication entropy $ε$. The Replicator-Optimization Mechanism (ROM) governs evolutionary selection over coordination strategies: configurations generating less friction persist longer, establishing consent-respecting arrangements as dynamical attractors rather than normative ideals.
  We develop formal definitions for resource consent, coordination legitimacy, and friction-aware allocation in multi-agent systems. The framework yields testable predictions: MARL systems with higher reward alignment exhibit faster convergence; distributed allocations accounting for stake asymmetry generate lower coordination failure; AI systems with interpretability deficits produce friction proportional to the human-AI alignment gap. Applications to cryptocurrency governance and political systems demonstrate that the same equations govern friction dynamics across domains, providing a complexity science perspective on coordination under preference heterogeneity.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning in dynamic social dilemmas commonly relies on parameter sharing to enable scalability. We show that in shared-policy Deep Q-Network learning, standard exploration can induce a robust and systematic collapse of cooperation even in environments where fully cooperative equilibria are stable and payoff dominant. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that shared DQN converges to stable but persistently low-cooperation regimes. This collapse is not caused by reward misalignment, noise, or insufficient training, but by a representational failure arising from partial observability combined with parameter coupling across heterogeneous agent states. Exploration-driven updates bias the shared representation toward locally dominant defection responses, which then propagate across agents and suppress cooperative learning. We confirm that the failure persists across network sizes, exploration schedules, and payoff structures, and disappears when parameter sharing is removed or when agents maintain independent representations. These results identify a fundamental failure mode of shared-policy MARL and establish structural conditions under which scalable learning architectures can systematically undermine cooperation. Our findings provide concrete guidance for the design of multi-agent learning systems in social and economic environments where collective behavior is critical.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Knowledge distillation (KD) has the potential to accelerate MARL by employing a centralized teacher for decentralized students but faces key bottlenecks. Specifically, there are (1) challenges in synthesizing high-performing teaching policies in complex domains, (2) difficulties when teachers must reason in out-of-distribution (OOD) states, and (3) mismatches between the decentralized students' and the centralized teacher's observation spaces. To address these limitations, we propose HINT (Hierarchical INteractive Teacher-based transfer), a novel KD framework for MARL in a centralized training, decentralized execution setup. By leveraging hierarchical RL, HINT provides a scalable, high-performing teacher. Our key innovation, pseudo off-policy RL, enables the teacher policy to be updated using both teacher and student experience, thereby improving OOD adaptation. HINT also applies performance-based filtering to retain only outcome-relevant guidance, reducing observation mismatches. We evaluate HINT on challenging cooperative domains (e.g., FireCommander for resource allocation, MARINE for tactical combat). Across these benchmarks, HINT outperforms baselines, achieving improvements of 60% to 165% in success rate.</p>

<p class='card-text'>With the rapid growth of IoT devices and latency-sensitive applications, the demand for both real-time and energy-efficient computing has surged, placing significant pressure on traditional cloud computing architectures. Mobile edge computing (MEC), an emerging paradigm, effectively alleviates the load on cloud centers and improves service quality by offloading computing tasks to edge servers closer to end users. However, the limited computing resources, non-continuous power provisioning (e.g., battery-powered nodes), and highly dynamic systems of edge servers complicate efficient task scheduling and resource allocation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, TG-DCMADDPG, and constructs a collaborative computing framework for multiple edge servers, aiming to achieve joint optimization of fine-grained task partitioning and offloading. This approach incorporates a temporal graph neural network (TimeGNN) to model and predict time series of multi-dimensional server state information, thereby reducing the frequency of online interactions and improving policy predictability. Furthermore, a multi-agent deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DC-MADDPG) in a discrete-continuous hybrid action space is introduced to collaboratively optimize task partitioning ratios, transmission power, and priority scheduling strategies. Extensive simulation experiments confirm that TG-DCMADDPG achieves markedly faster policy convergence, superior energy-latency optimization, and higher task completion rates compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its robust scalability and practical effectiveness in dynamic and constrained MEC scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Conventional optimization-based metering depends on strict adherence to precomputed schedules, which limits the flexibility required for the stochastic operations of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). In contrast, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a decentralized, adaptive framework that can better handle uncertainty, required for safe aircraft separation assurance. Despite this advantage, current MARL approaches often overfit to specific airspace structures, limiting their adaptability to new configurations. To improve generalization, we recast the MARL problem in a relative polar state space and train a transformer encoder model across diverse traffic patterns and intersection angles. The learned model provides speed advisories to resolve conflicts while maintaining aircraft near their desired cruising speeds. In our experiments, we evaluated encoder depths of 1, 2, and 3 layers in both structured and unstructured airspaces, and found that a single encoder configuration outperformed deeper variants, yielding near-zero near mid-air collision rates and shorter loss-of-separation infringements than the deeper configurations. Additionally, we showed that the same configuration outperforms a baseline model designed purely with attention. Together, our results suggest that the newly formulated state representation, novel design of neural network architecture, and proposed training strategy provide an adaptable and scalable decentralized solution for aircraft separation assurance in both structured and unstructured airspaces.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Distributed Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) integrated with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent research focus, enabling real-time cooperative decision-making in partially observable environments through inter-agent communication. However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who" and ``what" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The next-generation wireless technologies, including beyond 5G and 6G networks, are paving the way for transformative applications such as vehicle platooning, smart cities, and remote surgery. These innovations are driven by a vast array of interconnected wireless entities, including IoT devices, access points, UAVs, and CAVs, which increase network complexity and demand more advanced decision-making algorithms. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), especially reinforcement learning (RL), are key enablers for such networks, providing solutions to high-dimensional and complex challenges. However, as networks expand to multi-agent environments, traditional online RL approaches face cost, safety, and scalability limitations. Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a promising solution by utilizing pre-collected data, reducing the need for real-time interaction. This article introduces a novel offline MARL algorithm based on conservative Q-learning (CQL), ensuring safe and efficient training. We extend this with meta-learning to address dynamic environments and validate the approach through use cases in radio resource management and UAV networks.

<p class='card-text'>Heterogeneity is a fundamental property in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which is closely related not only to the functional differences of agents, but also to policy diversity and environmental interactions. However, the MARL field currently lacks a rigorous definition and deeper understanding of heterogeneity. This paper systematically discusses heterogeneity in MARL from the perspectives of definition, quantification, and utilization. First, based on an agent-level modeling of MARL, we categorize heterogeneity into five types and provide mathematical definitions. Second, we define the concept of heterogeneity distance and propose a practical quantification method. Third, we design a heterogeneity-based multi-agent dynamic parameter sharing algorithm as an example of the application of our methodology. Case studies demonstrate that our method can effectively identify and quantify various types of agent heterogeneity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, compared to other parameter sharing baselines, has better interpretability and stronger adaptability. The proposed methodology will help the MARL community gain a more comprehensive and profound understanding of heterogeneity, and further promote the development of practical algorithms.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Modern AI systems often comprise multiple learnable components that can be naturally organized as graphs. A central challenge is the end-to-end training of such systems without restrictive architectural or training assumptions. Such tasks fit the theory and approaches of the collaborative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) field. We introduce Reinforcement Networks, a general framework for MARL that organizes agents as vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure extends hierarchical RL to arbitrary DAGs, enabling flexible credit assignment and scalable coordination while avoiding strict topologies, fully centralized training, and other limitations of current approaches. We formalize training and inference methods for the Reinforcement Networks framework and connect it to the LevelEnv concept to support reproducible construction, training, and evaluation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several collaborative MARL setups by developing several Reinforcement Networks models that achieve improved performance over standard MARL baselines. Beyond empirical gains, Reinforcement Networks unify hierarchical, modular, and graph-structured views of MARL, opening a principled path toward designing and training complex multi-agent systems. We conclude with theoretical and practical directions - richer graph morphologies, compositional curricula, and graph-aware exploration. That positions Reinforcement Networks as a foundation for a new line of research in scalable, structured MARL.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Securing blockchain-enabled IoT networks against sophisticated adversarial attacks remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a trust-based delegated consensus framework integrating Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) with Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for privacy-preserving policy evaluation, combined with learning-based defense mechanisms. We systematically compare three reinforcement learning approaches -- tabular Q-learning (RL), Deep RL with Dueling Double DQN (DRL), and Multi-Agent RL (MARL) -- against five distinct attack families: Naive Malicious Attack (NMA), Collusive Rumor Attack (CRA), Adaptive Adversarial Attack (AAA), Byzantine Fault Injection (BFI), and Time-Delayed Poisoning (TDP). Experimental results on a 16-node simulated IoT network reveal significant performance variations: MARL achieves superior detection under collusive attacks (F1=0.85 vs. DRL's 0.68 and RL's 0.50), while DRL and MARL both attain perfect detection (F1=1.00) against adaptive attacks where RL fails (F1=0.50). All agents successfully defend against Byzantine attacks (F1=1.00). Most critically, the Time-Delayed Poisoning attack proves catastrophic for all agents, with F1 scores dropping to 0.11-0.16 after sleeper activation, demonstrating the severe threat posed by trust-building adversaries. Our findings indicate that coordinated multi-agent learning provides measurable advantages for defending against sophisticated trust manipulation attacks in blockchain IoT environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In distributed computing systems, reducing the communication load during the data shuffling phase is a critical challenge, as excessive inter-node transmissions are a major performance bottleneck. One promising approach to alleviate this burden is Embedded Index Coding (EIC), which exploits cached data at user nodes to encode transmissions more efficiently. However, most prior work on EIC has focused on minimizing code length in wired, error-free environments-an objective often suboptimal for wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where channel conditions and spatial multiplexing gains must be considered. This paper investigates the joint design of EIC and transmit beamforming in MIMO systems to minimize total transmission time, an NP-hard problem. We first present a conventional optimization method that determines the optimal EIC via exhaustive search. To address its prohibitive complexity and adapt to dynamic wireless environments, we propose a novel, low-complexity multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The proposed framework enables decentralized agents to act on local observations while effectively managing the hybrid action space of discrete EIC selection and continuous beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MARL-based approach achieves near-optimal performance with significantly reduced complexity, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for real-world wireless systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising auxiliary platform for smart agriculture, capable of simultaneously performing weed detection, recognition, and data collection from wireless sensors. However, trajectory planning for UAV-based smart agriculture is challenging due to the high uncertainty of the environment, partial observations, and limited battery capacity of UAVs. To address these issues, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to solve it. Furthermore, we propose a novel imitation-based triple deep Q-network (ITDQN) algorithm, which employs an elite imitation mechanism to reduce exploration costs and utilizes a mediator Q-network over a double deep Q-network (DDQN) to accelerate and stabilize training and improve performance. Experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. Moreover, our proposed ITDQN outperforms DDQN by 4.43\% in weed recognition rate and 6.94\% in data collection rate.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We study distributed control of networked systems through reinforcement learning, where neural policies must be simultaneously scalable, expressive and stabilizing. We introduce a policy parameterization that embeds Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into a Youla-like magnitude-direction parameterization, yielding distributed stochastic controllers that guarantee network-level closed-loop stability by design. The magnitude is implemented as a stable operator consisting of a GNN acting on disturbance feedback, while the direction is a GNN acting on local observations. We prove robustness of the closed loop to perturbations in both the graph topology and model parameters, and show how to integrate our parameterization with Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments on a multi-agent navigation task show that policies trained on small networks transfer directly to larger ones and unseen network topologies, achieve higher returns and lower variance than a state-of-the-art MARL baseline while preserving stability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reactive jammers pose a severe security threat to robotic-swarm networks by selectively disrupting inter-agent communications and undermining formation integrity and mission success. Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are booming in the field of collaborative intelligence, and StarCraft multi-agent challenge (SMAC) is widely-used as the benchmark therein. However, imaginary opponents of MARL algorithms are practically configured and controlled in a fixed built-in AI mode, which causes less diversity and versatility in algorithm evaluation. To address this issue, in this work, we establish a multi-agent algorithm-vs-algorithm environment, named StarCraft II battle arena (SC2BA), to refresh the benchmarking of MARL algorithms in an adversary paradigm. Taking StarCraft as infrastructure, the SC2BA environment is specifically created for inter-algorithm adversary with the consideration of fairness, usability and customizability, and meantime an adversarial PyMARL (APyMARL) library is developed with easy-to-use interfaces/modules. Grounding in SC2BA, we benchmark those classic MARL algorithms in two types of adversarial modes: dual-algorithm paired adversary and multi-algorithm mixed adversary, where the former conducts the adversary of pairwise algorithms while the latter focuses on the adversary to multiple behaviors from a group of algorithms. The extensive benchmark experiments exhibit some thought-provoking observations/problems in the effectivity, sensibility and scalability of these completed algorithms. The SC2BA environment as well as reproduced experiments are released in \href{https://github.com/dooliu/SC2BA}{Github}, and we believe that this work could mark a new step for the MARL field in the coming years.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The increasing operational reliance on complex Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) across safety-critical domains necessitates rigorous adversarial robustness assessment. Modern MAS are inherently heterogeneous, integrating conventional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with emerging Large Language Model (LLM) agent architectures utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). A critical shared vulnerability is reliance on centralized memory components: the shared Experience Replay (ER) buffer in MARL and the external Knowledge Base (K) in RAG agents. This paper proposes XAMT (Bilevel Optimization for Covert Memory Tampering in Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Architectures), a novel framework that formalizes attack generation as a bilevel optimization problem. The Upper Level minimizes perturbation magnitude (delta) to enforce covertness while maximizing system behavior divergence toward an adversary-defined target (Lower Level). We provide rigorous mathematical instantiations for CTDE MARL algorithms and RAG-based LLM agents, demonstrating that bilevel optimization uniquely crafts stealthy, minimal-perturbation poisons evading detection heuristics. Comprehensive experimental protocols utilize SMAC and SafeRAG benchmarks to quantify effectiveness at sub-percent poison rates (less than or equal to 1 percent in MARL, less than or equal to 0.1 percent in RAG). XAMT defines a new unified class of training-time threats essential for developing intrinsically secure MAS, with implications for trust, formal verification, and defensive strategies prioritizing intrinsic safety over perimeter-based detection.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Graph-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) enables coordinated behavior under partial observability by modeling agents as nodes and communication links as edges. While recent methods excel at learning sparse coordination graphs-determining who communicates with whom-they do not address what information should be transmitted under hard bandwidth constraints. We study this bandwidth-limited regime and show that naive dimensionality reduction consistently degrades coordination performance. Hard bandwidth constraints force selective encoding, but deterministic projections lack mechanisms to control how compression occurs. We introduce Bandwidth-constrained Variational Message Encoding (BVME), a lightweight module that treats messages as samples from learned Gaussian posteriors regularized via KL divergence to an uninformative prior. BVME's variational framework provides principled, tunable control over compression strength through interpretable hyperparameters, directly constraining the representations used for decision-making. Across SMACv1, SMACv2, and MPE benchmarks, BVME achieves comparable or superior performance while using 67--83% fewer message dimensions, with gains most pronounced on sparse graphs where message quality critically impacts coordination. Ablations reveal U-shaped sensitivity to bandwidth, with BVME excelling at extreme ratios while adding minimal overhead.</p>

For this purpose, a family of deterministic games is introduced, designed for scaling studies for MARL.

<p class='card-text'>Collaborative pursuit-evasion in cluttered environments presents significant challenges due to sparse rewards and constrained Fields of View (FOV). Standard Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from inefficient exploration and fails to scale to large scenarios. We propose PGF-MAPPO (Path-Guided Frontier MAPPO), a hierarchical framework bridging topological planning with reactive control. To resolve local minima and sparse rewards, we integrate an A*-based potential field for dense reward shaping. Furthermore, we introduce Directional Frontier Allocation, combining Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) with geometric angle suppression to enforce spatial dispersion and accelerate coverage. The architecture employs a parameter-shared decentralized critic, maintaining O(1) model complexity suitable for robotic swarms. Experiments demonstrate that PGF-MAPPO achieves superior capture efficiency against faster evaders. Policies trained on 10x10 maps exhibit robust zero-shot generalization to unseen 20x20 environments, significantly outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is commonly deployed in settings where agents are trained via self-play with homogeneous teammates, often using parameter sharing and a single policy architecture. This opens the question: to what extent do self-play PPO agents learn general coordination strategies grounded in the underlying game, compared to overfitting to their training partners' behaviors? This paper investigates the question using the Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Challenge (HeMAC) environment, which features distinct Observer and Drone agents with complementary capabilities. We introduce Rotating Policy Training (RPT), an approach that rotates heterogeneous teammate policies of different learning algorithms during training, to expose the agent to a broader range of partner strategies. When playing alongside a withheld teammate policy (DDQN), we find that RPT achieves similar performance to a standard self-play baseline, IPPO, where all agents were trained sharing a single PPO policy. This result indicates that in this heterogeneous multi-agent setting, the IPPO baseline generalizes to novel teammate algorithms despite not experiencing teammate diversity during training. This shows that a simple IPPO baseline may possess the level of generalization to novel teammates that a diverse training regimen was designed to achieve.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms as dynamic communication relays is critical for next-generation tactical networks. However, operating in contested environments requires solving a complex trade-off, including maximizing system throughput while ensuring collision avoidance and resilience against adversarial jamming. Existing heuristic-based approaches often struggle to find effective solutions due to the dynamic and multi-objective nature of this problem. This paper formulates this challenge as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem, solved using the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework. Our approach employs a centralized critic that uses global state information to guide decentralized actors which operate using only local observations. Simulation results show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms heuristic baselines, increasing the total system throughput by approximately 50% while simultaneously achieving a near-zero collision rate. A key finding is that the agents develop an emergent anti-jamming strategy without explicit programming. They learn to intelligently position themselves to balance the trade-off between mitigating interference from jammers and maintaining effective communication links with ground users.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Large language models (LLMs) are post-trained through reinforcement learning (RL) to evolve into Reasoning Language Models (RLMs), where the hallmark of this advanced reasoning is ``aha'' moments when they start to perform strategies, such as self-reflection and deep thinking, within chain of thoughts (CoTs). Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Analysing learning behaviour in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) environments is challenging, in particular with respect to \textit{individual} decision-making. Practitioners frequently tend to study or compare MARL algorithms from a qualitative perspective largely due to the inherent stochasticity in practical algorithms arising from random dithering exploration strategies, environment transition noise, and stochastic gradient updates to name a few. Traditional analytical approaches, such as replicator dynamics, often rely on mean-field approximations to remove stochastic effects, but this simplification, whilst able to provide general overall trends, might lead to dissonance between analytical predictions and actual realisations of individual trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on MARL systems by modelling them as \textit{coupled stochastic dynamical systems}, capturing both agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Leveraging tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyse the stability and sensitivity of agent behaviour at individual level, which are key dimensions for their practical deployments, for example, in presence of strict safety requirements. This framework allows us, for the first time, to rigorously study MARL dynamics taking into consideration their inherent stochasticity, providing a deeper understanding of system behaviour and practical insights for the design and control of multi-agent learning processes.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Vehicle collisions remain a major challenge in large-scale mixed traffic systems, especially when human-driven vehicles (HVs) and robotic vehicles (RVs) interact under dynamic and uncertain conditions. Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers promising capabilities for traffic signal control, ensuring safety in such environments remains difficult. As a direct indicator of traffic risk, the collision rate must be well understood and incorporated into traffic control design. This study investigates the primary factors influencing collision rates in a MARL-governed Mixed Traffic Control (MTC) network. We examine three dimensions: total vehicle count, signalized versus unsignalized intersection configurations, and turning-movement strategies. Through controlled simulation experiments, we evaluate how each factor affects collision likelihood. The results show that collision rates are sensitive to traffic density, the level of signal coordination, and turning-control design. These findings provide practical insights for improving the safety and robustness of MARL-based mixed traffic control systems, supporting the development of intelligent transportation systems in which both efficiency and safety are jointly optimized.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The low-altitude intelligent networks (LAINs) emerge as a promising architecture for delivering low-latency and energy-efficient edge intelligence in dynamic and infrastructure-limited environments. By integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aerial base stations, and terrestrial base stations, LAINs can support mission-critical applications such as disaster response, environmental monitoring, and real-time sensing. However, these systems face key challenges, including energy-constrained UAVs, stochastic task arrivals, and heterogeneous computing resources. To address these issues, we propose an integrated air-ground collaborative network and formulate a time-dependent integer nonlinear programming problem that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory planning and task offloading decisions. The problem is challenging to solve due to temporal coupling among decision variables. Therefore, we design a hierarchical learning framework with two timescales. At the large timescale, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism enables the energy-aware and incentive-compatible trajectory assignment. At the small timescale, we propose the diffusion-heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization, a generative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that embeds latent diffusion models into actor networks. Each UAV samples actions from a Gaussian prior and refines them via observation-conditioned denoising, enhancing adaptability and policy diversity. Extensive simulations show that our framework outperforms baselines in energy efficiency, task success rate, and convergence performance.</p>
