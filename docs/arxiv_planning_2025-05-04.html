<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how
chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance.
However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel
reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a
bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT
that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the
semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the
token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch
generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce
BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes
both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning
strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance
with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE
benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1. Code is available

  Extrinsic Manipulation under Force Uncertainty</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Sense of touch that allows robots to detect contact and measure interaction
forces enables them to perform challenging tasks such as grasping fragile
objects or using tools. Tactile sensors in theory can equip the robots with
such capabilities. However, accuracy of the measured forces is not on a par
with those of the force sensors due to the potential calibration challenges and
noise. This has limited the values these sensors can offer in manipulation
applications that require force control. In this paper, we introduce GeoDEx, a
unified estimation, planning, and control framework using geometric primitives
such as plane, cone and ellipsoid, which enables dexterous as well as extrinsic
manipulation in the presence of uncertain force readings. Through various
experimental results, we show that while relying on direct inaccurate and noisy
force readings from tactile sensors results in unstable or failed manipulation,
our method enables successful grasping and extrinsic manipulation of different
objects. Additionally, compared to directly running optimization using SOCP
(Second Order Cone Programming), planning and force estimation using our
framework achieves a 14x speed-up.</p>

  Prediction for Automated Parking using Diffusion Models</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-01 15:16:59</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
(ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception
and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains
relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal
trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a
novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians
in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to
capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories,
incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder
that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a
two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type
embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the
distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure
kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently
used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories.
We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the
Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for
heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming
existing methods by a considerable margin.</p>

  Analysis with Missing Modalities</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Lucas Robinet, Ahmad Berjaoui, Elizabeth Cohen-Jonathan Moyal</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-01 14:51:30</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitutes the first line of
investigation for clinicians in the care of brain tumors, providing crucial
insights for surgery planning, treatment monitoring, and biomarker
identification. Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models
learn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This
behavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often
scarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a
challenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are
available during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing
modalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or
specific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a
common approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality
combination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for
clinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling
pre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained
model seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting
rich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This
allows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural
changes, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of
modalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy
outperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate
pre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training
from scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and
efficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value.

<p class='card-text'>Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most
previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to
the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal
logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF,
Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We
identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K
specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in
five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D
space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped
navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL
satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach
is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we
show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and
robustness to out-distribution STL specifications. Code is available at

<p class='card-text'>Collaborative robots must continually adapt to novel tasks and user
preferences without overburdening the user. While prior interactive robot
learning methods aim to reduce human effort, they are typically limited to
single-task scenarios and are not well-suited for sustained, multi-task
collaboration. We propose COIL (Cost-Optimal Interactive Learning) -- a
multi-task interaction planner that minimizes human effort across a sequence of
tasks by strategically selecting among three query types (skill, preference,
and help). When user preferences are known, we formulate COIL as an
uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem, which enables bounded-suboptimal
planning in polynomial time using off-the-shelf approximation algorithms. We
extend our formulation to handle uncertainty in user preferences by
incorporating one-step belief space planning, which uses these approximation
algorithms as subroutines to maintain polynomial-time performance. Simulated
and physical experiments on manipulation tasks show that our framework
significantly reduces the amount of work allocated to the human while
maintaining successful task completion.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Automated GUI agents aims to facilitate user interaction by automatically
performing complex tasks in digital environments, such as web, mobile, desktop
devices. It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate
executable actions (\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step.
Training a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which
the GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the
task, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on
historical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of
insufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of
backtracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above
challenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding
and backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI
samples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and
unified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models.
Moreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action
from the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that
led to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence
between GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules
of the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Surgery plays an important role within the treatment for neuroblastoma, a
common pediatric cancer. This requires careful planning, often via magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)-based anatomical 3D models. However, creating these
models is often time-consuming and user dependent. We organized the Surgical
Planning in Pediatric Neuroblastoma (SPPIN) challenge, to stimulate
developments on this topic, and set a benchmark for fully automatic
segmentation of neuroblastoma on multi-model MRI. The challenge started with a
training phase, where teams received 78 sets of MRI scans from 34 patients,
consisting of both diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans. The final test
phase, consisting of 18 MRI sets from 9 patients, determined the ranking of the
teams. Ranking was based on the Dice similarity coefficient (Dice score), the
95th percentile of the Hausdorff distance (HD95) and the volumetric similarity
(VS). The SPPIN challenge was hosted at MICCAI 2023. The final leaderboard
consisted of 9 teams. The highest-ranking team achieved a median Dice score
0.82, a median HD95 of 7.69 mm and a VS of 0.91, utilizing a large, pretrained
network called STU-Net. A significant difference for the segmentation results
between diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans was observed (Dice = 0.89 vs
Dice = 0.59, P = 0.01) for the highest-ranking team. SPPIN is the first medical
segmentation challenge in extracranial pediatric oncology. The highest-ranking
team used a large pre-trained network, suggesting that pretraining can be of
use in small, heterogenous datasets. Although the results of the
highest-ranking team were high for most patients, segmentation especially in
small, pre-treated tumors were insufficient. Therefore, more reliable
segmentation methods are needed to create clinically applicable models to aid
surgical planning in pediatric neuroblastoma.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper proposes an integrated approach for the safe and efficient control
of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. The approach consists
of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions
of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these
predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an
energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step
predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized
to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of
treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by
proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The
overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a
specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach
allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its
performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical
warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-30 23:14:32</h6>
<p class='card-text'>While game-theoretic planning frameworks are effective at modeling
multi-agent interactions, they require solving optimization problems with
hundreds or thousands of variables, resulting in long computation times that
limit their use in large-scale, real-time systems. To address this issue, we
propose PSN Game: a novel game-theoretic planning framework that reduces
runtime by learning a Player Selection Network (PSN). A PSN outputs a player
selection mask that distinguishes influential players from less relevant ones,
enabling the ego player to solve a smaller, masked game involving only selected
players. By reducing the number of variables in the optimization problem, PSN
directly lowers computation time. The PSN Game framework is more flexible than
existing player selection methods as it i) relies solely on observations of
players' past trajectories, without requiring full state, control, or other
game-specific information; and ii) requires no online parameter tuning. We
train PSNs in an unsupervised manner using a differentiable dynamic game
solver, with reference trajectories from full-player games guiding the
learning. Experiments in both simulated scenarios and human trajectory datasets
demonstrate that i) PSNs outperform baseline selection methods in trajectory
smoothness and length, while maintaining comparable safety and achieving a 10x
speedup in runtime; and ii) PSNs generalize effectively to real-world scenarios
without fine-tuning. By selecting only the most relevant players for
decision-making, PSNs offer a general mechanism for reducing planning
complexity that can be seamlessly integrated into existing multi-agent planning
frameworks.</p>

then a formalization of the natural language description. The semantics are
given by fuzzy representations in a concrete domain and satisfaction degrees of

<p class='card-text'>Solving problems related to planning and operations of large-scale power
systems is challenging on classical computers due to their inherent nature as
mixed-integer and nonlinear problems. Quantum computing provides new avenues to
approach these problems. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for
the Unit Commitment (UC) problem in power systems which aims at minimizing the
total cost while optimally allocating generating units to meet the hourly
demand of the power loads. The hybrid algorithm combines a variational quantum
algorithm (VQA) with a classical Bender's type heuristic. The resulting
algorithm computes approximate solutions to UC in three stages: i) a collection
of UC vectors capable meeting the power demand with lowest possible operating
costs is generated based on VQA; ii) a classical sequential least squares
programming (SLSQP) routine is leveraged to find the optimal power level
corresponding to a predetermined number of candidate vectors; iii) in the last
stage, the approximate solution of UC along with generating units power level
combination is given. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method,
three different systems with 3 generating units, 10 generating units, and 26
generating units were tested for different time periods. In addition,
convergence of the hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for select time periods
is proven out on IonQ's Forte system.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Electronic-structure theory is the foundation of the description of materials
including multiscale modeling of their properties and functions. Obviously,
without sufficient accuracy at the base, reliable predictions are unlikely at
any level that follows. The software package FHI-aims has proven to be a game
changer for accurate free-energy calculations because of its scalability,
numerical precision, and its efficient handling of density functional theory
(DFT) with hybrid functionals and van der Waals interactions. It treats
molecules, clusters, and extended systems (solids and liquids) on an equal
footing. Besides DFT, FHI-aims also includes quantum-chemistry methods,
descriptions for excited states and vibrations, and calculations of various
types of transport. Recent advancements address the integration of FHI-aims
into an increasing number of workflows and various artificial intelligence (AI)
methods. This Roadmap describes the state-of-the-art of FHI-aims and
advancements that are currently ongoing or planned.</p>

<p class='card-text'>India is a founder-member country to participate in the construction of the
international multipurpose accelerator facility called the Facility for
Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at Darmstadt, Germany. Bose Institute,
Kolkata, has been designated as the Indian shareholder of the FAIR GmbH and the
nodal Indian Institution for co-ordinating Indian participation in the FAIR
programme.
  Indian participation in FAIR is twofold. Firstly, the advancement of
knowledge in nuclear astrophysics and reaction, high-energy nuclear physics,
atomic \& plasma physics and application through the participation of Indian
researchers, engineers and students in various experiments planned at FAIR. In
addition to this, India is also contributing high-tech accelerator equipment as
in-kind contribution to FAIR.
  Our active involvement include the designing, manufacturing and supply of
in-kind accelerator items e.g. power converters, vacuum chamber, beam catchers,
IT diagnostic cables among them and coordinating the participation of Indian
scientists in the FAIR experiments including detector development, physics
simulation, experimental data analysis.
  Indian researchers have been participating in the two major experiments at
FAIR, i.e. Nuclear Structure, Astrophysics and Reactions (NUSTAR) and
Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) and in particular Bose Institute is involved
in the CBM experiment, to study and characterize the matter created in the
relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions at high net baryon density and
relatively moderate temperature.
  In this article a brief overview on the FAIR facility, the experiments at
FAIR and Indian participation are presented.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This article proposes a new path planning method for addressing multi-level
terrain situations. The proposed method includes innovations in three aspects:
1) the pre-processing of point cloud maps with a multi-level skip-list
structure and data-slimming algorithm for well-organized and simplified map
formalization and management, 2) the direct acquisition of local traversability
indexes through vehicle and point cloud interaction analysis, which saves work
in surface fitting, and 3) the assignment of traversability indexes on a
multi-level connectivity graph to generate a weighted traversability graph for
generally search-based path planning. The A* algorithm is modified to utilize
the traversability graph to generate a short and safe path. The effectiveness
and reliability of the proposed method are verified through indoor and outdoor
experiments conducted in various environments, including multi-floor buildings,
woodland, and rugged mountainous regions. The results demonstrate that the
proposed method can properly address 3D path planning problems for ground
vehicles in a wide range of situations.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This study examines the psychological impact of energy crises on households,
utilising the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) to measure the stress induced
by disruptions in electricity, gas, and fuel supply and pricing. Through a
multivariate analysis incorporating Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression,
Simultaneous-Quantile Regressions (SQR), Random Forest (RF) and Ordered Probit
models, the research identifies the key socio-demographic and environmental
factors influencing household stress. Our findings reveal that urban residency,
low-income households, older individuals, and those with low environmental
awareness are particularly vulnerable to stress during energy crises. Regional
disparities and attitudes towards nuclear and renewable energy also
significantly shape stress responses. The study emphasises the need for
psychologically-informed energy policy, advocating for the inclusion of stress
metrics in energy planning to enhance resilience and address the
multi-dimensional nature of energy insecurity. This research contributes a
novel, human-centric perspective to energy policy, urging policymakers to

<p class='card-text'>Cloud computing has become a pivotal platform for executing scientific
workflows due to its scalable and cost-effective infrastructure. Scientific
Cloud Service Providers (SCSPs) act as intermediaries that rent virtual
machines (VMs) from Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers to meet users'
workflow execution demands. The SCSP earns profit from the execution of
scientific workflows if it completes the execution of the workflow before the
specified deadline of the workflow. This paper addresses two key challenges
that impact the profitability of SCSPs: the cold start problem and the
efficient management of diverse VM pricing models, namely reserved, on-demand,
and spot instances.
  We propose a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates initial planning
based on historical data with real-time adaptations informed by actual workload
variations. In the initial phase, VMs are provisioned using reserved pricing
based on predicted workloads and spot instances. During execution, the system
dynamically adjusts by provisioning additional VMs through on-demand or spot
instances to accommodate unexpected bursts in task arrivals. Our framework also
incorporates a dependency-aware task scheduling strategy that accounts for cold
start delays and spot pricing volatility. Experimental results on real-world
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 20% improvement over cold-start-focused techniques and
15% over pricing-model-based VM provisioning strategies.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Precise manipulation tasks require accurate knowledge of payload inertial
parameters. Unfortunately, identifying these parameters for unknown payloads
while ensuring that the robotic system satisfies its input and state
constraints while avoiding collisions with the environment remains a
significant challenge. This paper presents an integrated framework that enables
robotic manipulators to safely and automatically identify payload parameters
while maintaining operational safety guarantees. The framework consists of two
synergistic components: an online trajectory planning and control framework
that generates provably-safe exciting trajectories for system identification
that can be tracked while respecting robot constraints and avoiding obstacles
and a robust system identification method that computes rigorous
overapproximative bounds on end-effector inertial parameters assuming bounded
sensor noise. Experimental validation on a robotic manipulator performing
challenging tasks with various unknown payloads demonstrates the framework's
effectiveness in establishing accurate parameter bounds while maintaining

by identifying and analyzing critical dependencies in large-scale CSE. Based on
17 semi-structured interviews conducted at two Nordic fintech companies, our
preliminary findings indicate that dependencies between software teams and

<p class='card-text'>Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is marked by significant inter-individual
variability in its progression, complicating accurate prognosis and
personalized care planning. This heterogeneity underscores the critical need
for predictive models capable of forecasting patient-specific disease
trajectories. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers powerful tools to address
this challenge by analyzing complex, multi-modal, and longitudinal patient

personalized AD progression prediction. We review key approaches including
state-space models for capturing temporal dynamics, deep learning techniques
like Recurrent Neural Networks for sequence modeling, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) for leveraging network structures, and the emerging concept of AI-driven
digital twins for individualized simulation. Recognizing that data limitations

<p class='card-text'>While most heuristics studied in heuristic search depend only on the state,
some accumulate information during search and thus also depend on the search
history. Various existing approaches use such dynamic heuristics in
$\mathrm{A}^*$-like algorithms and appeal to classic results for $\mathrm{A}^*$

<p class='card-text'>Efficient mission planning for cooperative systems involving Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) requires addressing energy
constraints, scalability, and coordination challenges between agents. UAVs
excel in rapidly covering large areas but are constrained by limited battery
life, while UGVs, with their extended operational range and capability to serve
as mobile recharging stations, are hindered by slower speeds. This
heterogeneity makes coordination between UAVs and UGVs critical for achieving
optimal mission outcomes. In this work, we propose a scalable deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to address the energy-constrained
cooperative routing problem for multi-agent UAV-UGV teams, aiming to visit a
set of task points in minimal time with UAVs relying on UGVs for recharging
during the mission. The framework incorporates sortie-wise agent switching to
efficiently manage multiple agents, by allocating task points and coordinating
actions. Using an encoder-decoder transformer architecture, it optimizes routes
and recharging rendezvous for the UAV-UGV team in the task scenario. Extensive
computational experiments demonstrate the framework's superior performance over
heuristic methods and a DRL baseline, delivering significant improvements in
solution quality and runtime efficiency across diverse scenarios.
Generalization studies validate its robustness, while dynamic scenario
highlights its adaptability to real-time changes with a case study. This work
advances UAV-UGV cooperative routing by providing a scalable, efficient, and
robust solution for multi-agent mission planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We study a variant of LTLf synthesis that synthesizes adaptive strategies for
achieving a multi-tier goal, consisting of multiple increasingly challenging
LTLf objectives in nondeterministic planning domains. Adaptive strategies are
strategies that at any point of their execution (i) enforce the satisfaction of
as many objectives as possible in the multi-tier goal, and (ii) exploit
possible cooperation from the environment to satisfy as many as possible of the
remaining ones. This happens dynamically: if the environment cooperates (ii)
and an objective becomes enforceable (i), then our strategies will enforce it.
We provide a game-theoretic technique to compute adaptive strategies that is
sound and complete. Notably, our technique is polynomial, in fact quadratic, in
the number of objectives. In other words, it handles multi-tier goals with only
a minor overhead compared to standard LTLf synthesis.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Mechanical search (MS) in cluttered environments remains a significant
challenge for autonomous manipulators, requiring long-horizon planning and
robust state estimation under occlusions and partial observability. In this
work, we introduce XPG-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that enables
agents to efficiently perform MS tasks through explainable, priority-guided
decision-making based on raw sensory inputs. XPG-RL integrates a task-driven
action prioritization mechanism with a learned context-aware switching strategy
that dynamically selects from a discrete set of action primitives such as
target grasping, occlusion removal, and viewpoint adjustment. Within this
strategy, a policy is optimized to output adaptive threshold values that govern
the discrete selection among action primitives. The perception module fuses
RGB-D inputs with semantic and geometric features to produce a structured scene
representation for downstream decision-making. Extensive experiments in both
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that XPG-RL consistently
outperforms baseline methods in task success rates and motion efficiency,
achieving up to 4.5$\times$ higher efficiency in long-horizon tasks. These
