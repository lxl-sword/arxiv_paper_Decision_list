<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising solution
for learning complex and scalable coordination behaviors in multi-robot
systems. However, established MARL platforms (e.g., SMAC and MPE) lack robotics
relevance and hardware deployment, leaving multi-robot learning researchers to
develop bespoke environments and hardware testbeds dedicated to the development
and evaluation of their individual contributions. The Multi-Agent RL Benchmark
and Learning Environment for the Robotarium (MARBLER) is an exciting recent
step in providing a standardized robotics-relevant platform for MARL, by
bridging the Robotarium testbed with existing MARL software infrastructure.
However, MARBLER lacks support for parallelization and GPU/TPU execution,
making the platform prohibitively slow compared to modern MARL environments and
hindering adoption. We contribute JaxRobotarium, a Jax-powered end-to-end
simulation, learning, deployment, and benchmarking platform for the Robotarium.
JaxRobotarium enables rapid training and deployment of multi-robot
reinforcement learning (MRRL) policies with realistic robot dynamics and safety
constraints, supporting both parallelization and hardware acceleration. Our
generalizable learning interface provides an easy-to-use integration with SOTA
MARL libraries (e.g., JaxMARL). In addition, JaxRobotarium includes eight
standardized coordination scenarios, including four novel scenarios that bring
established MARL benchmark tasks (e.g., RWARE and Level-Based Foraging) to a
realistic robotics setting. We demonstrate that JaxRobotarium retains high
simulation fidelity while achieving dramatic speedups over baseline (20x in
training and 150x in simulation), and provides an open-access sim-to-real
evaluation pipeline through the Robotarium testbed, accelerating and
democratizing access to multi-robot learning research and evaluation.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-10 17:04:33</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Large-scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from the
curse of dimensionality, as the exponential growth in agent interactions
significantly increases computational complexity and impedes learning
efficiency. To mitigate this, existing efforts that rely on Mean Field (MF)
simplify the interaction landscape by approximating neighboring agents as a
single mean agent, thus reducing overall complexity to pairwise interactions.
However, these MF methods inevitably fail to account for individual
differences, leading to aggregation noise caused by inaccurate iterative
updates during MF learning. In this paper, we propose a Bi-level Mean Field
(BMF) method to capture agent diversity with dynamic grouping in large-scale
MARL, which can alleviate aggregation noise via bi-level interaction.
Specifically, BMF introduces a dynamic group assignment module, which employs a
Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to learn the representations of agents,
facilitating their dynamic grouping over time. Furthermore, we propose a
bi-level interaction module to model both inter- and intra-group interactions
for effective neighboring aggregation. Experiments across various tasks
demonstrate that the proposed BMF yields results superior to the
state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-09 11:42:31</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces critical challenges
due to distributional shifts, further exacerbated by the high dimensionality of
joint action spaces and the diversity in coordination strategies and quality
among agents. Conventional approaches, including independent learning
frameworks and value decomposition methods based on pessimistic principles,
remain susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions and often yield
suboptimal performance. Through systematic analysis of prevalent offline MARL
benchmarks, we identify that this limitation primarily stems from the
inherently multimodal nature of joint collaborative policies induced by offline
data collection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage
framework: First, we employ a diffusion-based generative model to explicitly
capture the complex behavior policy, enabling accurate modeling of diverse
multi-agent coordination patterns. Second, we introduce a sequential score
function decomposition mechanism to regularize individual policies and enable
decentralized execution. Extensive experiments on continuous control tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple standard offline MARL
benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by 26.3\% in normalized returns. Our
approach provides new insights into offline coordination and equilibrium
selection in cooperative multi-agent systems.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-09 11:39:18</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In-X Subnetworks are envisioned to meet the stringent demands of short-range
communication in diverse 6G use cases. In the context of In-Factory scenarios,
effective power control is critical to mitigating the impact of interference
resulting from potentially high subnetwork density. Existing approaches to
power control in this domain have predominantly emphasized the data plane,
often overlooking the impact of signaling overhead. Furthermore, prior work has
typically adopted a network-centric perspective, relying on the assumption of
complete and up-to-date channel state information (CSI) being readily available
at the central controller. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to enable access points to
autonomously learn both signaling and power control protocols in an In-Factory
Subnetwork environment. By formulating the problem as a partially observable
Markov decision process (POMDP) and leveraging multi-agent proximal policy
optimization (MAPPO), the proposed approach achieves significant advantages.
The simulation results demonstrate that the learning-based method reduces
signaling overhead by a factor of 8 while maintaining a buffer flush rate that
lags the ideal "Genie" approach by only 5%.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Learning to cooperate in distributed partially observable environments with
no communication abilities poses significant challenges for multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper addresses key concerns in this
domain, focusing on inferring state representations from individual agent
observations and leveraging these representations to enhance agents'
exploration and collaborative task execution policies. To this end, we propose
a novel state modelling framework for cooperative MARL, where agents infer
meaningful belief representations of the non-observable state, with respect to
optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant and less informative
joint state information. Building upon this framework, we propose the MARL SMPE
algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative abilities
under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs into the
policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration
policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while
improving the discriminative abilities of others. Experimentally, we show that
SMPE outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex fully cooperative
tasks from the MPE, LBF, and RWARE benchmarks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In real-world multi-agent systems (MASs), observation delays are ubiquitous,
preventing agents from making decisions based on the environment's true state.
An individual agent's local observation often consists of multiple components
from other agents or dynamic entities in the environment. These discrete
observation components with varying delay characteristics pose significant
challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In this paper, we
first formulate the decentralized stochastic individual delay partially
observable Markov decision process (DSID-POMDP) by extending the standard
Dec-POMDP. We then propose the Rainbow Delay Compensation (RDC), a MARL
training framework for addressing stochastic individual delays, along with
recommended implementations for its constituent modules. We implement the
DSID-POMDP's observation generation pattern using standard MARL benchmarks,
including MPE and SMAC. Experiments demonstrate that baseline MARL methods
suffer severe performance degradation under fixed and unfixed delays. The
RDC-enhanced approach mitigates this issue, remarkably achieving ideal
delay-free performance in certain delay scenarios while maintaining
generalizability. Our work provides a novel perspective on multi-agent delayed
observation problems and offers an effective solution framework. The source

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-06 14:11:21</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The teleoperated driving (TD) scenario comes with stringent Quality of
Service (QoS) communication constraints, especially in terms of end-to-end
(E2E) latency and reliability. In this context, Predictive Quality of Service
(PQoS), possibly combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, is a
powerful tool to estimate QoS degradation and react accordingly. For example,
an intelligent agent can be trained to select the optimal compression
configuration for automotive data, and reduce the file size whenever QoS
conditions deteriorate. However, compression may inevitably compromise data
quality, with negative implications for the TD application. An alternative
strategy involves operating at the Radio Access Network (RAN) level to optimize
radio parameters based on current network conditions, while preserving data
quality. In this paper, we propose Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
scheduling algorithms, based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to
dynamically and intelligently allocate radio resources to minimize E2E latency
in a TD scenario. We evaluate two training paradigms, i.e., decentralized
learning with local observations (IPPO) vs. centralized aggregation (MAPPO), in
conjunction with two resource allocation strategies, i.e., proportional
allocation (PA) and greedy allocation (GA). We prove via ns-3 simulations that
MAPPO, combined with GA, achieves the best results in terms of latency,
especially as the number of vehicles increases.</p>

  Learning</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-06 13:41:59</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Judicious resource allocation can effectively enhance federated learning (FL)
training performance in wireless networks by addressing both system and
statistical heterogeneity. However, existing strategies typically rely on block
fading assumptions, which overlooks rapid channel fluctuations within each
round of FL gradient uploading, leading to a degradation in FL training
performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a small-scale-fading-aware resource
allocation strategy using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
framework. Specifically, we establish a one-step convergence bound of the FL
algorithm and formulate the resource allocation problem as a decentralized
partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which is subsequently
solved using the QMIX algorithm. In our framework, each client serves as an
agent that dynamically determines spectrum and power allocations within each
coherence time slot, based on local observations and a reward derived from the
convergence analysis. The MARL setting reduces the dimensionality of the action
space and facilitates decentralized decision-making, enhancing the scalability
and practicality of the solution. Experimental results demonstrate that our
QMIX-based resource allocation strategy significantly outperforms baseline
methods across various degrees of statistical heterogeneity. Additionally,
ablation studies validate the critical importance of incorporating small-scale
fading dynamics, highlighting its role in optimizing FL performance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Preventing collisions in multi-robot navigation is crucial for deployment.
This requirement hinders the use of learning-based approaches, such as
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), on their own due to their lack of
safety guarantees. Traditional control methods, such as reachability and
control barrier functions, can provide rigorous safety guarantees when
interactions are limited only to a small number of robots. However, conflicts
between the constraints faced by different agents pose a challenge to safe
multi-agent coordination.
  To overcome this challenge, we propose a method that integrates multiple
layers of safety by combining MARL with safety filters. First, MARL is used to
learn strategies that minimize multiple agent interactions, where multiple
indicates more than two. Particularly, we focus on interactions likely to
result in conflicting constraints within the engagement distance. Next, for
agents that enter the engagement distance, we prioritize pairs requiring the
most urgent corrective actions. Finally, a dedicated safety filter provides
tactical corrective actions to resolve these conflicts. Crucially, the design
decisions for all layers of this framework are grounded in reachability
analysis and a control barrier-value function-based filtering mechanism.
  We validate our Layered Safe MARL framework in 1) hardware experiments using
Crazyflie drones and 2) high-density advanced aerial mobility (AAM) operation
scenarios, where agents navigate to designated waypoints while avoiding
collisions. The results show that our method significantly reduces conflict
while maintaining safety without sacrificing much efficiency (i.e., shorter
travel time and distance) compared to baselines that do not incorporate layered
safety. The project website is available at

<p class='card-text'>Achieving resilience remains a significant challenge for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) communications in 5G and 6G networks. Although UAVs benefit from
superior positioning capabilities, rate optimization techniques, and extensive
line-of-sight (LoS) range, these advantages alone cannot guarantee high
reliability across diverse UAV use cases. This limitation becomes particularly
evident in urban environments, where UAVs face vulnerability to jamming attacks
and where LoS connectivity is frequently compromised by buildings and other
physical obstructions. This paper introduces DET-FAIR- WINGS (
Detection-Enhanced Transformer Framework for AI-Resilient Wireless Networks in
Ground UAV Systems), a novel solution designed to enhance reliability in UAV
communications under attacks. Our system leverages multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) and transformer-based detection algorithms to identify attack
patterns within the network and subsequently select the most appropriate
mechanisms to strengthen reliability in authenticated UAV-Base Station links.
The DET-FAIR-WINGS approach integrates both discrete and continuous parameters.
Discrete parameters include retransmission attempts, bandwidth partitioning,
and notching mechanisms, while continuous parameters encompass beam angles and
elevations from both the Base Station (BS) and user devices. The detection part
integrates a transformer in the agents to speed up training. Our findings
demonstrate that replacing fixed retransmission counts with AI-integrated

<p class='card-text'>Lane changing is a complex decision-making problem for Connected and
Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) as it requires balancing traffic efficiency with
safety. Although traffic efficiency can be improved by using vehicular
communication for training lane change controllers using Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL), ensuring safety is difficult. To address this
issue, we propose a decentralised Hybrid Safety Shield (HSS) that combines
optimisation and a rule-based approach to guarantee safety. Our method applies
control barrier functions to constrain longitudinal and lateral control inputs
of a CAV to ensure safe manoeuvres. Additionally, we present an architecture to
integrate HSS with MARL, called MARL-HSS, to improve traffic efficiency while
ensuring safety. We evaluate MARL-HSS using a gym-like environment that
simulates an on-ramp merging scenario with two levels of traffic densities,
such as light and moderate densities. The results show that HSS provides a
safety guarantee by strictly enforcing a dynamic safety constraint defined on a
time headway, even in moderate traffic density that offers challenging lane
change scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method learns stable policies compared
to the baseline, a state-of-the-art MARL lane change controller without a
safety shield. Further policy evaluation shows that our method achieves a
balance between safety and traffic efficiency with zero crashes and comparable

<p class='card-text'>In typical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems, communication
is important for agents to share information and make the right decisions.
However, due to the complexity of training multi-agent communication, existing
methods often fall into the dilemma of local optimization, which leads to the
concentration of communication in a limited number of channels and presents an
unbalanced structure. Such unbalanced communication policy are vulnerable to
abnormal conditions, where the damage of critical communication channels can
trigger the crash of the entire system. Inspired by decentralization theory in
sociology, we propose DMAC, which enhances the robustness of multi-agent
communication policies by retraining them into decentralized patterns.
Specifically, we train an adversary DMAC\_Adv which can dynamically identify
and mask the critical communication channels, and then apply the adversarial
samples generated by DMAC\_Adv to the adversarial learning of the communication
policy to force the policy in exploring other potential communication schemes
and transition to a decentralized structure. As a training method to improve
robustness, DMAC can be fused with any learnable communication policy
algorithm. The experimental results in two communication policies and four
multi-agent tasks demonstrate that DMAC achieves higher improvement on
robustness and performance of communication policy compared with two
state-of-the-art and commonly-used baselines. Also, the results demonstrate
that DMAC can achieve decentralized communication structure with acceptable

<p class='card-text'>Modern renewables-based power systems need to tap on the flexibility of
Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) connected to distribution networks. It is
important, however, that DER owners/users remain in control of their assets,
decisions, and objectives. At the same time, the dynamic landscape of
DER-penetrated distribution networks calls for agile, data-driven flexibility
management frameworks. In the face of these developments, the Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) paradigm is gaining significant attention, as a
distributed and data-driven decision-making policy. This paper addresses the
need for bottom-up DER management decisions to account for the distribution
network's safety-related constraints. While the related literature on safe MARL
typically assumes that network characteristics are available and incorporated
into the policy's safety layer, which implies active DSO engagement, this paper
ensures that self-organized DER communities are enabled to provide
distribution-network-safe flexibility services without relying on the
aspirational and problematic requirement of bringing the DSO in the
decision-making loop.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-24 14:20:11</h6>
<p class='card-text'>O-RAN (Open-Radio Access Network) offers a flexible, open architecture for
next-generation wireless networks. Network slicing within O-RAN allows network
operators to create customized virtual networks, each tailored to meet the
specific needs of a particular application or service. Efficiently managing
these slices is crucial for future 6G networks. O-RAN introduces specialized
software applications called xApps that manage different network functions. In
network slicing, an xApp can be responsible for managing a separate network
slice. To optimize resource allocation across numerous network slices, these
xApps must coordinate. Traditional methods where all xApps communicate freely
can lead to excessive overhead, hindering network performance. In this paper,
we address the issue of xApp conflict mitigation by proposing an innovative
Zero-Touch Management (ZTM) solution for radio resource management in O-RAN.
Our approach leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to enable
xApps to learn and optimize resource allocation without the need for constant
manual intervention. We introduce a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based
attention mechanism to streamline communication among xApps, reducing overhead
and improving overall system efficiency. Our results compare traditional MARL,
where all xApps communicate, against our MARL GCN-based attention method. The
findings demonstrate the superiority of our approach, especially as the number
of xApps increases, ultimately providing a scalable and efficient solution for
optimal network slicing management in O-RAN.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Tasks for multi-robot systems often require the robots to collaborate and
complete a team goal while maintaining safety. This problem is usually
formalized as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which targets
minimizing a global cost and bringing the mean of constraint violation below a
user-defined threshold. Inspired by real-world robotic applications, we define
safety as zero constraint violation. While many safe multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) algorithms have been proposed to solve CMDPs, these algorithms
suffer from unstable training in this setting. To tackle this, we use the
epigraph form for constrained optimization to improve training stability and
prove that the centralized epigraph form problem can be solved in a distributed
fashion by each agent. This results in a novel centralized training distributed
execution MARL algorithm named Def-MARL. Simulation experiments on 8 different
tasks across 2 different simulators show that Def-MARL achieves the best
overall performance, satisfies safety constraints, and maintains stable
training. Real-world hardware experiments on Crazyflie quadcopters demonstrate
the ability of Def-MARL to safely coordinate agents to complete complex
collaborative tasks compared to other methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
addressing complex, agentic tasks requiring multifaceted reasoning and
collaboration, from generating high-quality presentation slides to conducting
sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for
its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has
investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques.
Moreover, the direct application of MARL methodologies to LaMAS introduces
significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms
inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a
comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a universal
algorithmic framework tailored for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations,
key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We begin by
reviewing the evolution from RL to Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, setting the stage
for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we
elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences
motivate a transition toward a novel, LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT.
Central to this work is the presentation of a robust and scalable MARFT
framework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source
implementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections
of the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges
in MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies,
this work aims to serve as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT
toward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation

<p class='card-text'>This survey explores the development of meta-thinking capabilities in Large
Language Models (LLMs) from a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
perspective. Meta-thinking self-reflection, assessment, and control of thinking
processes is an important next step in enhancing LLM reliability, flexibility,
and performance, particularly for complex or high-stakes tasks. The survey
begins by analyzing current LLM limitations, such as hallucinations and the
lack of internal self-assessment mechanisms. It then talks about newer methods,
including RL from human feedback (RLHF), self-distillation, and
chain-of-thought prompting, and each of their limitations. The crux of the
survey is to talk about how multi-agent architectures, namely supervisor-agent
hierarchies, agent debates, and theory of mind frameworks, can emulate
human-like introspective behavior and enhance LLM robustness. By exploring
reward mechanisms, self-play, and continuous learning methods in MARL, this
survey gives a comprehensive roadmap to building introspective, adaptive, and

<p class='card-text'>The Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) offers a powerful and versatile approach
to simulating diverse hydrodynamic phenomena, spanning microfluidics to
aerodynamics. The vast range of spatiotemporal scales inherent in these systems
currently renders full resolution impractical, necessitating the development of
effective closure models for under-resolved simulations. Under-resolved LBMs
are unstable, and while there is a number of important efforts to stabilize
them, they often face limitations in generalizing across scales and physical
systems. We present a novel, data-driven, multiagent reinforcement learning
(MARL) approach that drastically improves stability and accuracy of
coarse-grained LBM simulations. The proposed method uses a convolutional neural
network to dynamically control the local relaxation parameter for the LB across
the simulation grid. The LB-MARL framework is showcased in turbulent Kolmogorov
flows. We find that the MARL closures stabilize the simulations and recover the
energy spectra of significantly more expensive fully resolved simulations while
maintaining computational efficiency. The learned closure model can be
transferred to flow scenarios unseen during training and has improved
robustness and spectral accuracy compared to traditional LBM models. We believe
that MARL closures open new frontiers for efficient and accurate simulations of
a multitude of complex problems not accessible to present-day LB methods alone.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In cellular networks, cell handover refers to the process where a device
switches from one base station to another, and this mechanism is crucial for
balancing the load among different cells. Traditionally, engineers would
manually adjust parameters based on experience. However, the explosive growth
in the number of cells has rendered manual tuning impractical. Existing
research tends to overlook critical engineering details in order to simplify
handover problems. In this paper, we classify cell handover into three types,
and jointly model their mutual influence. To achieve load balancing, we propose
a multi-agent-reinforcement-learning (MARL)-based scheme to automatically
optimize the parameters. To reduce the agent interaction costs, a distributed
training is implemented based on consensus approximation of global average
load, and it is shown that the approximation error is bounded. Experimental
results show that our proposed scheme outperforms existing benchmarks in

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-17 14:07:11</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Credit assignment has remained a fundamental challenge in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Previous studies have primarily addressed this
issue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with
decentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to
approximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the
global Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in
various benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including
imprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor
scalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel algorithm, \textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic
construction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs).
Specifically, the concept of \textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit
allocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear
functional formulation. A custom-designed \textit{coder-evaluator} framework is
further employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of
executable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination
and shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on
several standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM
exhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a
wide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a
promising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Climate policy development faces significant challenges due to deep
uncertainty, complex system dynamics, and competing stakeholder interests.
Climate simulation methods, such as Earth System Models, have become valuable
tools for policy exploration. However, their typical use is for evaluating
potential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be
inverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization
approaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and
comprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting
climate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address
these limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate
simulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis,
including reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state
spaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation.
Additionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions
interpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation
for more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important
limitations and areas for future research.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-07 23:02:59</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for adaptive
traffic signal control (ATSC), enabling multiple intersections to coordinate
signal timings in real time. However, in large-scale settings, MARL faces
constraints due to extensive data sharing and communication requirements.
Federated learning (FL) mitigates these challenges by training shared models
without directly exchanging raw data, yet traditional FL methods such as FedAvg
struggle with highly heterogeneous intersections. Different intersections
exhibit varying traffic patterns, demands, and road structures, so performing
FedAvg across all agents is inefficient. To address this gap, we propose
Hierarchical Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL) for ATSC. HFRL employs
clustering-based or optimization-based techniques to dynamically group
intersections and perform FedAvg independently within groups of intersections
with similar characteristics, enabling more effective coordination and
scalability than standard FedAvg. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world
traffic networks demonstrate that HFRL not only outperforms both decentralized
and standard federated RL approaches but also identifies suitable grouping
patterns based on network structure or traffic demand, resulting in a more
robust framework for distributed, heterogeneous systems.</p>

  Multi-agent task allocation (MATA) plays a vital role in cooperative
multi-agent systems, with significant implications for applications such as
logistics, search and rescue, and robotic coordination. Although traditional
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been shown to be promising,
their effectiveness is hindered by a reliance on manually designed reward

reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework is proposed, in which multi-head
self-attention (MHSA) and graph attention mechanisms are incorporated to
enhance reward function learning and task execution efficiency. Expert
demonstrations are utilized to infer optimal reward densities, allowing
dependence on handcrafted designs to be reduced and adaptability to be
improved. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method
over widely used multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in terms
of both cumulative rewards and task execution efficiency.</p>
