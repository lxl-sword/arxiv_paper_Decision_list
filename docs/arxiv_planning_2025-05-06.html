  Rebalancing in Ride-Hailing Systems</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Avalpreet Singh Brar, Rong Su, Christos G. Cassandras, Gioele Zardini</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-05 12:15:01</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Traditional rebalancing methods in ride-hailing systems direct idle drivers
to fixed destinations, overlooking the fact that ride allocations frequently
occur while cruising. This destination-centric view fails to exploit the
path-dependent nature of modern platforms, where real-time matching depends on
the entire trajectory rather than a static endpoint. We propose the Wise Goose
Chase (WGC) algorithm, an event-triggered, driver-specific path planning
framework that anticipates future matching opportunities by forecasting
spatio-temporal supply and demand dynamics. WGC uses a system of Retarded
Functional Differential Equations (RFDEs) to model the evolution of idle driver
density and passenger queues at the road-segment level, incorporating both
en-route matching and competition among drivers. Upon request, WGC computes
personalized cruising paths that minimize each driver's expected time to
allocation. Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic urban networks show that WGC
consistently outperforms baseline strategies, highlighting the advantage of
predictive, context-aware rebalancing in dynamic mobility systems.</p>

  Cancer Survival Prediction</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Aiman Farooq, Azad Singh, Deepak Mishra, Santanu Chaudhury</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-05 10:10:03</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Cancer survival prediction using multi-modal medical imaging presents a
critical challenge in oncology, mainly due to the vulnerability of deep
learning models to noise and protocol variations across imaging centers.
Current approaches struggle to extract consistent features from heterogeneous
CT and PET images, limiting their clinical applicability. We address these
challenges by introducing RobSurv, a robust deep-learning framework that
leverages vector quantization for resilient multi-modal feature learning. The
key innovation of our approach lies in its dual-path architecture: one path
maps continuous imaging features to learned discrete codebooks for
noise-resistant representation, while the parallel path preserves fine-grained
details through continuous feature processing. This dual representation is
integrated through a novel patch-wise fusion mechanism that maintains local
spatial relationships while capturing global context via Transformer-based
processing. In extensive evaluations across three diverse datasets (HECKTOR,
H\&N1, and NSCLC Radiogenomics), RobSurv demonstrates superior performance,
achieving concordance index of 0.771, 0.742, and 0.734 respectively -
significantly outperforming existing methods. Most notably, our model maintains
robust performance even under severe noise conditions, with performance
degradation of only 3.8-4.5\% compared to 8-12\% in baseline methods. These
results, combined with strong generalization across different cancer types and
imaging protocols, establish RobSurv as a promising solution for reliable
clinical prognosis that can enhance treatment planning and patient care.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-05 07:58:54</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We propose FairPO, a novel framework designed to promote fairness in
multi-label classification by directly optimizing preference signals with a
group robustness perspective. In our framework, the set of labels is
partitioned into privileged and non-privileged groups, and a preference-based
loss inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is employed to more
effectively differentiate true positive labels from confusing negatives within
the privileged group, while preserving baseline classification performance for
non-privileged labels. By framing the learning problem as a robust optimization
over groups, our approach dynamically adjusts the training emphasis toward
groups with poorer performance, thereby mitigating bias and ensuring a fairer
treatment across diverse label categories. In addition, we outline plans to
extend this approach by investigating alternative loss formulations such as
Simple Preference Optimisation (SimPO) and Contrastive Preference Optimization
(CPO) to exploit reference-free reward formulations and contrastive training
signals. Furthermore, we plan to extend FairPO with multilabel generation
capabilities, enabling the model to dynamically generate diverse and coherent
label sets for ambiguous inputs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We present a real-time safety filter for motion planning, such as
learning-based methods, using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), which provides
formal guarantees for collision avoidance with road boundaries. A key feature
of our approach is its ability to directly incorporate road geometries of
arbitrary shape without resorting to conservative overapproximations. We
formulate the safety filter as a constrained optimization problem in the form
of a Quadratic Program (QP). It achieves safety by making minimal, necessary
adjustments to the control actions issued by the nominal motion planner. We
validate our safety filter through extensive numerical experiments across a
variety of traffic scenarios featuring complex roads. The results confirm its
reliable safety and high computational efficiency (execution frequency up to 40

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-05 02:39:55</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Designing dynamically feasible trajectories for rigid bodies is a fundamental
problem in robotics. Although direct trajectory optimization is widely applied
to solve this problem, inappropriate parameterizations of rigid body dynamics
often result in slow convergence and violations of the intrinsic topological
structure of the rotation group. This paper introduces a Riemannian
optimization framework for direct trajectory optimization of rigid bodies. We
first use the Lie Group Variational Integrator to formulate the discrete rigid
body dynamics on matrix Lie groups. We then derive the closed-form first- and
second-order Riemannian derivatives of the dynamics. Finally, this work applies
a line-search Riemannian Interior Point Method (RIPM) to perform trajectory
optimization with general nonlinear constraints. As the optimization is
performed on matrix Lie groups, it is correct-by-construction to respect the
topological structure of the rotation group and be free of singularities. The
paper demonstrates that both the derivative evaluations and Newton steps
required to solve the RIPM exhibit linear complexity with respect to the
planning horizon and system degrees of freedom. Simulation results illustrate
that the proposed method is faster than conventional methods by an order of
magnitude in challenging robotics tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>What is a good local description of contact dynamics for contact-rich
manipulation, and where can we trust this local description? While many
approaches often rely on the Taylor approximation of dynamics with an
ellipsoidal trust region, we argue that such approaches are fundamentally
inconsistent with the unilateral nature of contact. As a remedy, we present the
Contact Trust Region (CTR), which captures the unilateral nature of contact
while remaining efficient for computation. With CTR, we first develop a
Model-Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm capable of synthesizing local
contact-rich plans. Then, we extend this capability to plan globally by
stitching together local MPC plans, enabling efficient and dexterous
contact-rich manipulation. To verify the performance of our method, we perform
comprehensive evaluations, both in high-fidelity simulation and on hardware, on
two contact-rich systems: a planar IiwaBimanual system and a 3D AllegroHand
system. On both systems, our method offers a significantly lower-compute
alternative to existing RL-based approaches to contact-rich manipulation. In
particular, our Allegro in-hand manipulation policy, in the form of a roadmap,
takes fewer than 10 minutes to build offline on a standard laptop using just
its CPU, with online inference taking just a few seconds. Experiment data,

<p class='card-text'>Urban freshwater ecosystems, composed of rivers, ponds, lakes, and other
water bodies, have essential socioeconomic and ecological values for urban
residents. However, research investigating how individuals interact with lakes
remains limited, especially within cities and at fine spatiotemporal
resolutions. To fill this gap, we propose a data-driven analytical framework
that comprehensively senses human-lake interactions and profiles the
social-demographic characteristics of intra-city lakes. The term "lakeplace" is
proposed to depict a place containing lakes and human activities within it. For
each lake, the geographic boundary of its lakeplace refers to the first-order
administrative units, reflecting the neighboring scale of lake socioeconomics.
Utilizing large-scale individual mobile positioning data, we performed
lakeplace sensing on the 2,036 major lakes in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area
(TCMA), Minnesota, and the people interacting with them. The popularity of each
lakeplace was measured by its temporal visitations and further categorized as
on-lake and around-lake human activities. Popular lakeplaces were investigated
to depict whether the attractiveness of a lake is mostly brought by the lake
itself, or the social-demographic environment around it. The lakeplace sensing
framework offers a practical approach to the spatiotemporal characteristics of
human activities and understanding the social-demographic knowledge related to
human-lake systems. Our work exemplifies the social sensing of
human-environment interactions via geospatial big data, shedding light on
human-oriented sustainable urban planning and urban water resource management.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Query optimization is critical in relational databases. Recently, numerous
Learned Query Optimizers (LQOs) have been proposed, demonstrating superior
performance over traditional hand-crafted query optimizers after short training
periods. However, the opacity and instability of machine learning models have
limited their practical applications. To address this issue, we are the first
to formulate the LQO verification as a Conformal Prediction (CP) problem. We
first construct the CP model and obtain user-controlled bounded ranges for the
actual latency of LQO plans before execution. Then, we introduce CP-based
runtime verification along with violation handling to ensure performance prior
to execution. For both scenarios, we further extend our framework to handle
distribution shifts in the dynamic environment using adaptive CP approaches.
Finally, we present CP-guided plan search, which uses actual latency upper
bounds from CP to heuristically guide query plan construction. We integrated
our verification framework into three LQOs (Balsa, Lero, and RTOS) and
conducted evaluations on the JOB and TPC-H workloads. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method is both accurate and efficient. Our CP-based
approaches achieve tight upper bounds, reliably detect and handle violations.
Adaptive CP maintains accurate confidence levels even in the presence of
distribution shifts, and the CP-guided plan search improves both query plan
quality (up to 9.84x) and planning time, with a reduction of up to 74.4% for a
single query and 9.96% across all test queries from trained LQOs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In robotic, task goals can be conveyed through various modalities, such as
language, goal images, and goal videos. However, natural language can be
ambiguous, while images or videos may offer overly detailed specifications. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce CrayonRobo that leverages comprehensive
multi-modal prompts that explicitly convey both low-level actions and
high-level planning in a simple manner. Specifically, for each key-frame in the
task sequence, our method allows for manual or automatic generation of simple
and expressive 2D visual prompts overlaid on RGB images. These prompts
represent the required task goals, such as the end-effector pose and the
desired movement direction after contact. We develop a training strategy that
enables the model to interpret these visual-language prompts and predict the
corresponding contact poses and movement directions in SE(3) space.
Furthermore, by sequentially executing all key-frame steps, the model can
complete long-horizon tasks. This approach not only helps the model explicitly
understand the task objectives but also enhances its robustness on unseen tasks
by providing easily interpretable prompts. We evaluate our method in both

<p class='card-text'>Classical robot navigation often relies on hardcoded state machines and
purely geometric path planners, limiting a robot's ability to interpret
high-level semantic instructions. In this paper, we first assess GPT-4's
ability to act as a path planner compared to the A* algorithm, then present a
hybrid planning framework that integrates GPT-4's semantic reasoning with A* on
a low-cost robot platform operating on ROS2 Humble. Our approach eliminates
explicit finite state machine (FSM) coding by using prompt-based GPT-4
reasoning to handle task logic while maintaining the accurate paths computed by
A*. The GPT-4 module provides semantic understanding of instructions and
environmental cues (e.g., recognizing toxic obstacles or crowded areas to
avoid, or understanding low-battery situations requiring alternate route
selection), and dynamically adjusts the robot's occupancy grid via obstacle
buffering to enforce semantic constraints. We demonstrate multi-step reasoning
for sequential tasks, such as first navigating to a resource goal and then
reaching a final destination safely. Experiments on a Petoi Bittle robot with
an overhead camera and Raspberry Pi Zero 2W compare classical A* against
GPT-4-assisted planning. Results show that while A* is faster and more accurate
for basic route generation and obstacle avoidance, the GPT-4-integrated system
achieves high success rates (96-100%) on semantic tasks that are infeasible for
pure geometric planners. This work highlights how affordable robots can exhibit
intelligent, context-aware behaviors by leveraging large language model
reasoning with minimal hardware and no fine-tuning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The global surge in social inequalities is one of the most pressing issues of
our times. The spatial expression of social inequalities at city scale gives
rise to urban segregation, a common phenomenon across different local and
cultural contexts. The increasing popularity of Big Data and computational
models has inspired a growing number of computational social science studies
that analyze, evaluate, and issue policy recommendations for urban segregation.
Today's wealth in information and computational power could inform urban
planning for equity. However, as we show here, segregation research is
epistemologically interdependent with prevalent economic theories which
overfocus on individual responsibility while neglecting systemic processes.
This individualistic bias is also engrained in computational models of urban
segregation. Through several contemporary examples of how Big Data -- and the
assumptions underlying its usage -- influence (de)segregation patterns and
policies, our essay tells a cautionary tale. We highlight how a lack of
consideration for data ethics can lead to the creation of computational models
that have a real-life, further marginalizing impact on disadvantaged groups.
With this essay, our aim is to develop a better discernment of the pitfalls and
potentials of computational approaches to urban segregation, thereby fostering
a conscious focus on systemic thinking about urban inequalities. We suggest
setting an agenda for research and collective action that is directed at
demobilizing individualistic bias, informing our thinking about urban
segregation, but also more broadly our efforts to create sustainable cities and
communities.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm for solving planning and learning
problems of Markov decision processes. The proposed algorithm follows a policy
iteration-type update by using a rank-one approximation of the transition
probability matrix in the policy evaluation step. This rank-one approximation
is closely related to the stationary distribution of the corresponding
transition probability matrix, which is approximated using the power method. We
provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the proposed algorithm to
optimal (action-)value function with the same rate and computational complexity
as the value iteration algorithm in the planning problem and as the Q-learning
algorithm in the learning problem. Through our extensive numerical simulations,
however, we show that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms
first-order algorithms and their accelerated versions for both planning and
learning problems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in scientific modeling,
particularly for complex dynamical systems; however, accurately capturing
age-structured population dynamics under policy-driven fertility changes
remains a significant challenge due to the lack of effective integration
between domain knowledge and long-term temporal dependencies. To address this
issue, we propose two physics-informed deep learning frameworks--PINN and
LSTM-PINN--that incorporate policy-aware fertility functions into a
transport-reaction partial differential equation to simulate population
evolution from 2024 to 2054. The standard PINN model enforces the governing
equation and boundary conditions via collocation-based training, enabling
accurate learning of underlying population dynamics and ensuring stable
convergence. Building on this, the LSTM-PINN framework integrates sequential
memory mechanisms to effectively capture long-range dependencies in the
age-time domain, achieving robust training performance across multiple loss
components. Simulation results under three distinct fertility policy
scenarios-the Three-child policy, the Universal two-child policy, and the
Separate two-child policy--demonstrate the models' ability to reflect
policy-sensitive demographic shifts and highlight the effectiveness of
integrating domain knowledge into data-driven forecasting. This study provides
a novel and extensible framework for modeling age-structured population
dynamics under policy interventions, offering valuable insights for
data-informed demographic forecasting and long-term policy planning in the face
of emerging population challenges.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We present an integrated framework for truckload procurement in container
logistics, bridging strategic and operational aspects that are often treated
independently in existing research. Drayage, the short-haul trucking of
containers, plays a critical role in intermodal container logistics. Using
dynamic programming, we identify optimal operational policies for allocating
drayage volumes among capacitated carriers under uncertain container flows and
spot rates. The computational complexity of optimization under uncertainty is
mitigated through sample average approximation. These optimal policies serve as
the basis for evaluating specific capacity arrangements. To optimize capacity
reservations with strategic and spot carriers, we employ an efficient
quasi-Newton method. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant
cost-efficiency improvements, including a 21.2% cost reduction in a four-period
scenario. Monte Carlo simulations further highlight the strong generalization
capabilities of the proposed joint optimization method across out-of-sample
scenarios. These findings underscore the importance of integrating strategic
and operational decisions to enhance cost efficiency in truckload procurement

<p class='card-text'>Wildfires in urbanized regions, particularly within the wildland-urban
interface, have significantly intensified in frequency and severity, driven by
rapid urban expansion and climate change. This study aims to provide a
comprehensive, fine-grained evaluation of the recent 2025 Los Angeles
wildfire's impacts, through a multi-source, tri-environmental framework in the
social, built and natural environmental dimensions. This study employed a
spatiotemporal wildfire impact assessment method based on daily satellite fire
detections from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS),
infrastructure data from OpenStreetMap, and high-resolution dasymetric
population modeling to capture the dynamic progression of wildfire events in
two distinct Los Angeles County regions, Eaton and Palisades, which occurred in
January 2025. The modelling result estimated that the total direct economic
losses reached approximately 4.86 billion USD with the highest single-day
losses recorded on January 8 in both districts. Population exposure reached a
daily maximum of 4,342 residents in Eaton and 3,926 residents in Palisades. Our
modelling results highlight early, severe ecological and infrastructural damage
in Palisades, as well as delayed, intense social and economic disruptions in
Eaton. This tri-environmental framework underscores the necessity for tailored,
equitable wildfire management strategies, enabling more effective emergency
responses, targeted urban planning, and community resilience enhancement. Our
study contributes a highly replicable tri-environmental framework for
evaluating the natural, built and social environmental costs of natural
disasters, which can be applied to future risk profiling, hazard mitigation,

<p class='card-text'>Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based learning approaches for
wireless networks rely on expensive trial-and-error mechanisms and real-time
feedback based on extensive environment interactions, which leads to low data
efficiency and short-sighted policies. These limitations become particularly
problematic in complex, dynamic networks with high uncertainty and long-term
planning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel
world model-based learning framework is proposed to minimize
packet-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in a vehicular network.
Particularly, a challenging representative scenario is considered pertaining to
a millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network,
which is characterized by high mobility, frequent signal blockages, and
extremely short coherence time. Then, a world model framework is proposed to
jointly learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and use it to
imagine trajectories for learning how to perform link scheduling. In
particular, the long-term policy is learned in differentiable imagined
trajectories instead of environment interactions. Moreover, owing to its
imagination abilities, the world model can jointly predict time-varying
wireless data and optimize link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X
networks. Thus, during intervals without actual observations, the world model
remains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are
performed on a realistic simulator based on Sionna that integrates
physics-based end-to-end channel modeling, ray-tracing, and scene geometries
with material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model
achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency, and achieves 26%
improvement and 16% improvement in CAoI, respectively, compared to the
model-based RL (MBRL) method and the model-free RL (MFRL) method.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Runway and taxiway incursions continue to challenge aviation safety, as
pilots often experience disorientation from poor visibility in adverse
conditions and cognitive workload in complex airport layouts. Current tools,
such as airport moving maps on portable tablets, allow manual route planning
but do not dynamically adapt to air traffic controllers' (ATCOs) clearances,
limiting their effectiveness in high-stress scenarios. This study investigates
the impact of different input modalities - paper-based, keyboard touch, map
touch, and speech-to-text - on taxiway navigation performance, using a
medium-fidelity flight simulator and a Wizard-of-Oz methodology to simulate
ideal automation conditions. Contrary to common assumptions, recent studies
indicate that paper-based methods outperform digital counterparts in accuracy
and efficiency under certain conditions, highlighting critical limitations in
current automation strategies. In response, our study investigates why manual
methods may excel and how future automation can be optimized for pilot-centered
operations. Employing a Wizard-of-Oz approach, we replicated the full taxiing
process - from receiving ATCO clearances to executing maneuvers - and
differentiated between readback and execution accuracy. Findings reveal that
speech-based systems suffer from low pilot trust, necessitating hybrid
solutions that integrate error correction and confidence indicators. These
insights contribute to the development of future pilot-centered taxiway
assistance that enhance situational awareness, minimize workload, and improve
overall operational safety.</p>

<p class='card-text'>T-Rex (The Robot for Extracting Leaf Samples) is a gantry-based robotic
system developed for autonomous leaf localization, selection, and grasping in
greenhouse environments. The system integrates a 6-degree-of-freedom
manipulator with a stereo vision pipeline to identify and interact with target
leaves. YOLOv8 is used for real-time leaf segmentation, and RAFT-Stereo
provides dense depth maps, allowing the reconstruction of 3D leaf masks. These
observations are processed through a leaf grasping algorithm that selects the
optimal leaf based on clutter, visibility, and distance, and determines a grasp
point by analyzing local surface flatness, top-down approachability, and margin
from edges. The selected grasp point guides a trajectory executed by ROS-based
motion controllers, driving a custom microneedle-equipped end-effector to clamp
the leaf and simulate tissue sampling. Experiments conducted with artificial
plants under varied poses demonstrate that the T-Rex system can consistently
detect, plan, and perform physical interactions with plant-like targets,
achieving a grasp success rate of 66.6\%. This paper presents the system
architecture, implementation, and testing of T-Rex as a step toward plant

two-stage process. First, we employ PU learning to learn a skill risk predictor

<p class='card-text'>The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a crucial optimization challenge with
significant economic and environmental implications, particularly in logistics
and transportation planning. While classical algorithms struggle to efficiently
solve large-scale instances of VRP due to its combinatorial complexity, quantum
computing presents a promising alternative for tackling such problems. In this
work, we explore the application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA) to solve instances of VRP, analyzing its effectiveness and
scalability. We formulate VRP as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) problem by encoding the constraints into a single cost function suitable
for QAOA. Our study investigates the impact of problem size on quantum circuit
complexity and evaluate the feasibility of executing QAOA-based VRP solutions
on near-term quantum hardware. The results indicate that while QAOA
demonstrates potential for solving VRP, the primary limitation lies in circuit
depth and noise-induced errors, which critically affect performance on current
quantum processors. Overcoming these challenges will require advancements in
error mitigation techniques and more efficient quantum circuit designs to
realize the full potential of quantum computing for combinatorial optimization.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The generation of optimal trajectories for high-dimensional robotic systems
under constraints remains computationally challenging due to the need to
simultaneously satisfy dynamic feasibility, input limits, and task-specific
objectives while searching over high-dimensional spaces. Recent approaches
using the Affine Geometric Heat Flow (AGHF) Partial Differential Equation (PDE)
have demonstrated promising results, generating dynamically feasible
trajectories for complex systems like the Digit V3 humanoid within seconds.
These methods efficiently solve trajectory optimization problems over a
two-dimensional domain by evolving an initial trajectory to minimize control
effort. However, these AGHF approaches are limited to a single type of optimal
control problem (i.e., minimizing the integral of squared control norms) and
typically require initial guesses that satisfy constraints to ensure
satisfactory convergence. These limitations restrict the potential utility of
the AGHF PDE especially when trying to synthesize trajectories for robotic
systems. This paper generalizes the AGHF formulation to accommodate arbitrary
cost functions, significantly expanding the classes of trajectories that can be
generated. This work also introduces a Phase1 - Phase 2 Algorithm that enables
the use of constraint-violating initial guesses while guaranteeing satisfactory
convergence. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through
comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art techniques across various
dynamical systems and challenging trajectory generation problems. Project Page:

However, traditional physics-based and statistical methods for predicting water

and limited adaptability to diverse or unforeseen conditions. Recent
advancements in large time series models have demonstrated the potential to
address these limitations, with state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation

<p class='card-text'>The impact of new physics on the interactions of neutrinos with other
particles can be parametrized by a set of effective four-fermion operators
called non-standard neutrino interactions (NSIs). This NSI framework is useful
for studying the complementarity between different types of neutrino
experiments. In this work, we further compare the reach of neutrino experiments
with high-energy collider experiments. Since high-energy colliders often probe
the mass scale associated with the four-fermion operators, the effective field
theory approach becomes invalid and explicit models must be utilized. We study
a variety of representative simplified models including new U(1) gauge bosons,
scalar leptoquarks, and heavy neutral leptons. For each of these, we examine
the model parameter space constrained by NSI bounds from current and future
neutrino experiments, and by data from the Large Hadron Collider and planned
electron-positron and muon colliders. We find that in the models we study, with
the possible exceptions of muon-philic leptoquarks and heavy neutral leptons
mixing with electron or muon neutrinos, collider searches are more constraining
than neutrino measurements. Additionally, we briefly comment on other model
