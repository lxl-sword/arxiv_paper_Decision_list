<p class='card-text'>Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated
remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and
dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the
environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has
focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with
pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots
is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this
end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth,
bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to
include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these
models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model
and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our
framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for
vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that
minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts.
We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing
uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully
deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-18 16:48:43</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Sampling-based methods such as ReCom are widely used to audit redistricting
plans for fairness, with the balanced spanning tree distribution playing a
central role since it favors compact, contiguous, and population-balanced
districts. However, whether such samples are truly representative or exhibit
hidden biases remains an open question. In this work, we introduce the notion
of separation fairness, which asks whether adjacent geographic units are
separated with at most a constant probability (bounded away from one) in
sampled redistricting plans. Focusing on grid graphs and two-district
partitions, we prove that a smooth variant of the balanced spanning tree
distribution satisfies separation fairness. Our results also provide
theoretical support for popular MCMC methods like ReCom, suggesting that they
maintain fairness at a granular level in the sampling process. Along the way,
we develop tools for analyzing loop-erased random walks and partitions that may
be of independent interest.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The so-called $X17$ particle has been proposed in order to explain a very
significant resonant behaviour (in both the angular separation and invariant
mass) of $e^+e^-$ pairs produced during a nuclear transition of excited $^8$Be,
$^4$He and $^{12}$C nuclei. Fits to the corresponding data point, as most
probable explanation, to a spin-1 object, which is protophobic and has a mass
of approximately 16.7 MeV, which then makes the $X17$ potentially observable in
Coherent Elastic neutrino ($\nu$) Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) at the
European Spallation Source (ESS). By adopting as theoretical framework a
minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a generic $U(1)'$ gauge group
mixing with the hypercharge one of the latter, which can naturally accommodate
the $X17$ state compliant with all available measurements from a variety of
experiments, we predict that CE$\nu$NS at the ESS will constitute an effective
means to probe this hypothesis, even after allowing for the inevitable

based on the presence of two or more lung pathologies of varying severity. Lung
segmentation was performed using three previously developed deep learning

quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient,
Hausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical

MedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories

moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05),
without significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231
provided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models

<p class='card-text'>Future planetary exploration rovers must operate for extended durations on
hybrid power inputs that combine steady radioisotope thermoelectric generator
(RTG) output with variable solar photovoltaic (PV) availability. While
energy-aware planning has been studied for aerial and underwater robots under
battery limits, few works for ground rovers explicitly model power flow or
enforce instantaneous power constraints. Classical terrain-aware planners
emphasize slope or traversability, and trajectory optimization methods
typically focus on geometric smoothness and dynamic feasibility, neglecting
energy feasibility. We present an energy-constrained trajectory planning
framework that explicitly integrates physics-based models of translational,
rotational, and resistive power with baseline subsystem loads, under hybrid
RTG-solar input. By incorporating both cumulative energy budgets and
instantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory
optimization, the method ensures trajectories that are simultaneously smooth,
dynamically feasible, and power-compliant. Simulation results on lunar-like
terrain show that our planner generates trajectories with peak power within
0.55 percent of the prescribed limit, while existing methods exceed limits by
over 17 percent. This demonstrates a principled and practical approach to
energy-aware autonomy for long-duration planetary missions.</p>

intra-task coordination, and (c) cooperation through the formation of robot

of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task
performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network
flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online
algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task
failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline
approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random
missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a
greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced

<p class='card-text'>Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown
environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total
coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we
introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical
coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination
through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and
dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a
set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the
environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement
of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical
layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots
explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal
routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that
minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set
of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting
its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on
real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through
simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time,
total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate
the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner
in achieving these performance gains.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This short paper presents a general approach for computing robust Wasserstein
barycenters of persistence diagrams. The classical method consists in computing
assignment arithmetic means after finding the optimal transport plans between
the barycenter and the persistence diagrams. However, this procedure only works
for the transportation cost related to the $q$-Wasserstein distance $W_q$ when
$q=2$. We adapt an alternative fixed-point method to compute a barycenter
diagram for generic transportation costs ($q > 1$), in particular those robust
to outliers, $q \in (1,2)$. We show the utility of our work in two
applications: \emph{(i)} the clustering of persistence diagrams on their metric
space and \emph{(ii)} the dictionary encoding of persistence diagrams. In both
scenarios, we demonstrate the added robustness to outliers provided by our

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-18 12:07:00</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The concept of Deadbeat Robust Model Predictive Control (DRMPC) is to
completely extinguish the effect of external disturbances within the first few
steps of the prediction horizon. The benefit is that the remaining dynamics of
the system can be planned with certainty. This means it is not necessary to
employ a Robust Positive Invariant (RPI) set as a terminal condition, which is
often complex or even intractable to compute. Recent work has shown that it is
possible to obtain full system theoretic guarantees in the case of linear
systems, including recursive feasibility of all constraints and input-to-state
stability. This paper extends this contribution to linear time-varying (LTV) or
parameter-varying systems (LPV) systems with bounded parametric uncertainty and
additive disturbances. Full system-theoretic guarantees can also be provided
for these cases. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the performance
of the proposed LPV-DRMPC scheme, with the origin as the terminal set and a
slightly increased prediction horizon, is almost comparable to that of other
LPV-MPC schemes with an RPI terminal set constraint, despite a lower
computational complexity. Besides avoiding the computation of RPI terminal
sets, LPV-DRMPC allows to shift a significant portion of the computations
offline.</p>

<p class='card-text'>While simulators exist for vehicular IoT nodes communicating with the Cloud

presents an extension of SimulatorOrchestrator (SO) to meet these requirements.
Preliminary results over a realistic urban dataset show that utilising

<p class='card-text'>While trajectory prediction plays a critical role in enabling safe and

evaluating such models remain underdeveloped. Recent efforts have aimed to
unify dataset formats and model interfaces for easier comparisons, yet existing
frameworks often fall short in supporting heterogeneous traffic scenarios,
joint prediction models, or user documentation. In this work, we introduce STEP
-- a new benchmarking framework that addresses these limitations by providing a
unified interface for multiple datasets, enforcing consistent training and

<p class='card-text'>Manipulation in confined and cluttered environments remains a significant
challenge due to partial observability and complex configuration spaces.
Effective manipulation in such environments requires an intelligent exploration
strategy to safely understand the scene and search the target. In this paper,
we propose COMPASS, a multi-stage exploration and manipulation framework
featuring a manipulation-aware sampling-based planner. First, we reduce
collision risks with a near-field awareness scan to build a local collision
map. Additionally, we employ a multi-objective utility function to find
viewpoints that are both informative and conducive to subsequent manipulation.
Moreover, we perform a constrained manipulation optimization strategy to
generate manipulation poses that respect obstacle constraints. To
systematically evaluate method's performance under these difficulties, we
propose a benchmark of confined-space exploration and manipulation containing
four level challenging scenarios. Compared to exploration methods designed for
other robots and only considering information gain, our framework increases
manipulation success rate by 24.25% in simulations. Real-world experiments
demonstrate our method's capability for active sensing and manipulation in

<p class='card-text'>Graph condensation (GC) aims to distill the original graph into a small-scale
graph, mitigating redundancy and accelerating GNN training. However,
conventional GC approaches heavily rely on rigid GNNs and task-specific
supervision. Such a dependency severely restricts their reusability and
generalization across various tasks and architectures. In this work, we revisit
the goal of ideal GC from the perspective of GNN optimization consistency, and
then a generalized GC optimization objective is derived, by which those
traditional GC methods can be viewed nicely as special cases of this
optimization paradigm. Based on this, Pre-trained Graph Condensation (PreGC)
via optimal transport is proposed to transcend the limitations of task- and
architecture-dependent GC methods. Specifically, a hybrid-interval graph
diffusion augmentation is presented to suppress the weak generalization ability
of the condensed graph on particular architectures by enhancing the uncertainty
of node states. Meanwhile, the matching between optimal graph transport plan
and representation transport plan is tactfully established to maintain semantic
consistencies across source graph and condensed graph spaces, thereby freeing
graph condensation from task dependencies. To further facilitate the adaptation
of condensed graphs to various downstream tasks, a traceable semantic
harmonizer from source nodes to condensed nodes is proposed to bridge semantic
associations through the optimized representation transport plan in
pre-training. Extensive experiments verify the superiority and versatility of
PreGC, demonstrating its task-independent nature and seamless compatibility
with arbitrary GNNs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The presence of obstacles has a major impact on distance computation, motion
planning, and visibility. While these problems are well studied in the plane,
our understanding in three and higher dimensions is still limited. We
investigate how different obstacle properties affect the induced geodesic
metric in three-dimensional space. A finite metric space is said to be
approximately realizable by a collection of obstacles if, for any
$\varepsilon>0$, it can be embedded into the free space around the obstacles
with geodesic distance and worst-case distortion $1+\varepsilon$. We focus on
three key properties-convexity, disjointness, and fatness-and analyze how
omitting each of them influences realizability.
  Our main result shows that if fatness is dropped, then every finite metric
space can be realized with distortion $1+\varepsilon$ using convex, pairwise
disjoint obstacles in $\mathbb{R}^3$, even if all obstacles are congruent
equilateral triangles. Moreover, if we enforce fatness but drop convexity or
disjointness, the same realizability still holds.
  Our results have important implications on the approximability of TSP with
Obstacles, a natural variant of TSP introduced recently by Alkema et al. (ESA
2022). Specifically, we use the recent results of Banerjee et al. on TSP in
doubling spaces (FOCS 2024) and of Chew et al. on distances among obstacles
(Information Processing Letters 2002) to show that TSP with Obstacles admits a
PTAS if the obstacles are convex, fat, and pairwise disjoint. If any of these
three properties is dropped, then our results, combined with the APX-hardness
of Metric TSP, demonstrate that TSP with Obstacles is APX-hard.</p>

startup, each boot stage is measured into TPM PCRs. The node can only decrypt
its LUKS-sealed partitions after the cloud has verified a TPM quote and

overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and
pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible,
objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet)
reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human
agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower

<p class='card-text'>This study presents a system integration approach for planning schedules,
sequences, tasks, and motions for reconfigurable robots to automatically
disassemble constrained structures in a non-destructive manner. Such systems
must adapt their configuration and coordination to the target structure, but
the large and complex search space makes them prone to local optima. To address
this, we integrate multiple robot arms equipped with different types of tools,
together with a rotary stage, into a reconfigurable setup. This flexible system
is based on a hierarchical optimization method that generates plans meeting
multiple preferred conditions under mandatory requirements within a realistic
timeframe. The approach employs two many-objective genetic algorithms for
sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint
programming for scheduling. Because sequence planning has a much larger search
space, we introduce a chromosome initialization method tailored to constrained
structures to mitigate the risk of local optima. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method effectively solves complex problems in reconfigurable
robotic disassembly.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The chip design process involves numerous steps, beginning with defining
product requirements and progressing through architectural planning,
system-level design, and the physical layout of individual circuit blocks. As
the enablers of large-scale chip development, Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) tools play a vital role in helping designers achieve high-quality
results. The Shift-Left methodology introduces a pathway toward creating
digital twins and fusing multiple design steps, thereby transitioning
traditionally sequential, physically-aware processes into virtual design
environments. This shift allows designers to establish stronger correlations
earlier and optimize designs more effectively. However, challenges remain,
especially in accurately replicating downstream behaviors and determining the
right scope and timing for adoption. These challenges, in turn, have revealed
new opportunities for EDA vendors, physical designers, and logic designers
alike. As the industry advances toward intelligent EDA tools and techniques, it
is timely to reflect on Shift-Left progress made and the challenges that
remain. The rise of AI techniques and the momentum of open-source design flows
have significantly strengthened prediction and modeling capabilities, making
data-driven methods increasingly relevant to the EDA community. This, in turn,
enhances the ''Shift-Left'' features embedded in current tools. In this paper,
we present a comprehensive survey of existing and emerging paradigms in
Shift-Left research within EDA and the broader design ecosystem. Our goal is to
provide a unique perspective on the state of the field and its future
directions. Relevant papers mentioned are organized in

<p class='card-text'>Predictive process monitoring techniques support the operational decision
making by predicting future states of ongoing cases of a business process. A
subset of these techniques predict the remaining sequence of activities of an
ongoing case (case suffix prediction). Existing approaches for case suffix
prediction generate sequences of activities with a single timestamp (e.g. the
end timestamp). This output is insufficient for resource capacity planning,
where we need to reason about the periods of time when resources will be busy
performing work. This paper introduces a technique for predicting case suffixes
consisting of activities with start and end timestamps. In other words, the
proposed technique predicts both the waiting time and the processing time of
each activity. Since the waiting time of an activity in a case depends on how
busy resources are in other cases, the technique adopts a sweep-line approach,
wherein the suffixes of all ongoing cases in the process are predicted in
lockstep, rather than predictions being made for each case in isolation. An
evaluation on real-life and synthetic datasets compares the accuracy of
different instantiations of this approach, demonstrating the advantages of a
multi-model approach to case suffix prediction.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-18 01:55:33</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper addresses the challenges of automating vibratory sieve shaker
operations in a materials laboratory, focusing on three critical tasks: 1)
dual-arm lid manipulation in 3 cm clearance spaces, 2) bimanual handover in
overlapping workspaces, and 3) obstructed powder sample container delivery with
orientation constraints. These tasks present significant challenges, including
inefficient sampling in narrow passages, the need for smooth trajectories to
prevent spillage, and suboptimal paths generated by conventional methods. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a hierarchical planning framework
combining Prior-Guided Path Planning and Multi-Step Trajectory Optimization.
The former uses a finite Gaussian mixture model to improve sampling efficiency
in narrow passages, while the latter refines paths by shortening, simplifying,
imposing joint constraints, and B-spline smoothing. Experimental results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness: planning time is reduced by up to
80.4%, and waypoints are decreased by 89.4%. Furthermore, the system completes
the full vibratory sieve shaker operation workflow in a physical experiment,
validating its practical applicability for complex laboratory automation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Strawberries naturally grow in clusters, interwoven with leaves, stems, and
other fruits, which frequently leads to occlusion. This inherent growth habit
presents a significant challenge for robotic picking, as traditional
percept-plan-control systems struggle to reach fruits amid the clutter.
Effectively picking an occluded strawberry demands dexterous manipulation to
carefully bypass or gently move the surrounding soft objects and precisely
access the ideal picking point located at the stem just above the calyx. To
address this challenge, we introduce a strawberry-picking robotic system that
learns from human demonstrations. Our system features a 4-DoF SCARA arm paired
with a human teleoperation interface for efficient data collection and
leverages an End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to develop a
fine-grained visuomotor picking policy. Experiments under various occlusion
scenarios demonstrate that our modified approach significantly outperforms the
direct implementation of ACT, underscoring its potential for practical
application in occluded strawberry picking.</p>

<p class='card-text'>SPHEREx, a recently launched astronomy mission, detected a bright 1.083
micron emission feature in the commissioning data. The PI group attributed this
feature to the He I 1.0833 micron triplet line. Here, I review the physics and
aeronomy of this well-known line of atmospheric origin. SPHEREx is in a
dawn-dusk sun-synchronous polar orbit, circling the earth nearly 15 times a day
and observing close to the terminator plane. With a height of 650 km, SPHEREx
is located in the upper thermosphere that is dominated by atomic oxygen and
helium. The He I line is a result of resonance scattering of solar photons by
metastable helium atoms. It appears that SPHEREx has the capacity to provide a
rich dataset (global, daily, and 2-minute cadence) of column density of
metastable helium in the upper thermosphere. As an example of this assertion,
with data from just one orbit, the winter helium bulge was readily seen. Rapid
variations in the column density of metastable helium is seen over the south
pole which is probably due to spatial structure in the distribution of
metastable helium as well as solar activity. Helium in the thermosphere is of
considerable interest to operators of low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites,
since drag in the thermosphere is the primary cause of the decay of these
satellites. SPHEREx, along with on-going ground-based studies (passive NIR
spectroscopy, lidar, incoherent scatter radar), is poised to contribute to this
topic.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Deep JWST imaging of the massive galaxy cluster MACS0417.5-1154, at redshift
z=0.443, reveals a huge population of globular clusters (GCs) and Ultra-Compact
Dwarfs (UCDs) primarily distributed around its single central giant galaxy
(BCG). We present NIRCam/SWC photometry of the GC system in four bands (F090W,
F115W, F150W, F200W). The spatial distribution of the system matches well in
radial and ellipticity profile with the high elongation (b/a = 0.5) of the BCG
halo light. The total GC population within MACS0417 is estimated to be near 1.5
x 10^5, similar to the systems in Abell 2744, Coma, and other galaxy clusters
with comparable masses. With similar results for GC photometry in hand from
other lensing clusters at a range of redshifts, it is now possible to trace on
purely observational grounds the luminosity evolution of GC systems over many
Gigayears of lookback time, as seen through their color-magnitude diagrams. We
show this sequence for five systems reaching to lookback times of more than 7
Gyr. A systematic change in the GC/UCD sequence with lookback time is clearly
visible, near what is expected for age-fading of a simple stellar population
with time. Lastly, we evaluate the effectiveness of the various JWST NIRCam
filters for broadband photometry of GC systems as a function of redshift, as an
aid to planning further studies.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Learning abstractions directly from data is a core challenge in robotics.
Humans naturally operate at an abstract level, reasoning over high-level
subgoals while delegating execution to low-level motor skills -- an ability
that enables efficient problem solving in complex environments. In robotics,
abstractions and hierarchical reasoning have long been central to planning, yet
they are typically hand-engineered, demanding significant human effort and
limiting scalability. Automating the discovery of useful abstractions directly
from visual data would make planning frameworks more scalable and more
applicable to real-world robotic domains. In this work, we focus on
rearrangement tasks where the state is represented with raw images, and propose
a method to induce discrete, graph-structured abstractions by combining
structural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance. Our approach
leverages the inherent bipartite structure of rearrangement problems,
integrating structural constraints and visual embeddings into a unified
framework. This enables the autonomous discovery of abstractions from vision
alone, which can subsequently support high-level planning. We evaluate our
method on two rearrangement tasks in simulation and show that it consistently
identifies meaningful abstractions that facilitate effective planning and
outperform existing approaches.</p>

  Cone Barrier Functions on 3D Gaussian Splatting</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-17 20:43:56</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We present a perception-driven safety filter that converts each 3D Gaussian
Splat (3DGS) into a closed-form forward collision cone, which in turn yields a
first-order control barrier function (CBF) embedded within a quadratic program
(QP). By exploiting the analytic geometry of splats, our formulation provides a
continuous, closed-form representation of collision constraints that is both
simple and computationally efficient. Unlike distance-based CBFs, which tend to
activate reactively only when an obstacle is already close, our collision-cone
CBF activates proactively, allowing the robot to adjust earlier and thereby
produce smoother and safer avoidance maneuvers at lower computational cost. We
validate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats,
where our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly
decreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while
maintaining the same level of safety. The approach is entirely analytic,
requires no high-order CBF extensions (HOCBFs), and generalizes naturally to
robots with physical extent through a principled Minkowski-sum inflation of the
splats. These properties make the method broadly applicable to real-time
navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments, including
space robotics and satellite systems.</p>

populations, optimal feedback mechanisms, and the biomechanics of bodies.
First, we outline the distributed anatomical loops that shuttle sensorimotor
signals between cortex, subcortical regions, and spinal cord. We then summarize
evidence that neural population activity occupies low-dimensional, dynamically
evolving manifolds during planning and execution of movements. Next, we
summarize literature explaining motor behavior through the lens of optimal
control theory, which clarifies the role of internal models and feedback during
motor control. Finally, recent studies on embodied sensorimotor control address
gaps within each framework by aiming to elucidate neural population activity
through the explicit control of musculoskeletal dynamics. We close by

victim detection and georeferencing to nominate goals for the ground platform,
while a terrain-scouting UAV flies ahead of the UGV's planned route to provide
mid-level traversability updates. The UGV fuses aerial cues with local sensing
