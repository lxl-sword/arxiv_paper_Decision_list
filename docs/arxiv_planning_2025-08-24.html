<p class='card-text'>In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-21 17:20:52</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization
algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling
between the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing
the system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on
minimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work
investigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve
trajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling
matrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling
behavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength
and directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory
optimization framework. To assess the feasibility of the optimized trajectory,
a sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the
required joint torque inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that explicitly
accounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed
and potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the
control of free-floating SMSs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

<p class='card-text'>Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.</p>

Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts

<p class='card-text'>Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory

with a massive particle, can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the
spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely

quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to
realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus
on utilizing nanodiamonds as our particle, and a spin embedded in the ND
together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time.
There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting
this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our
plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor,
hoping this will support this growing community.
  In this work we demonstrate the neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds
using ultraviolet photoemission, and characterize the dependence of this
process on both the illumination wavelength and particle size. Furthermore, we
demonstrate discrete, single-electron charge manipulation of levitated
nanodiamond in a needle Paul trap at a pressure of 0.5\,Torr. Finally, we
demonstrate fast neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds, achieving a
neutralization rate much faster than the state of the art. As neutralization is
crucial to avoid spatial decoherence, this constitutes a significant step

<p class='card-text'>Landscape architecture typically considers urban parks through the lens of
form and function. While past research on equitable access has focused mainly
on form, studies of functions have been constrained by limited scale and coarse
measurement. Existing efforts have partially quantified functions through
small-scale surveys and movement data (e.g., GPS) or general usage records
(e.g., CDR), but have not captured the activities and motivations underlying
park visits. As a result, our understanding of the functional roles urban parks
play remains incomplete. To address this gap, we introduce a method that
refines mobile base station coverage using antenna azimuths, enabling clearer
distinction of mobile traffic within parks versus surrounding areas. Using
Paris as a case study, we analyze a large-scale set of passively collected
per-app mobile network traffic - 492 million hourly records for 45 parks. We
test two hypotheses: the central-city hypothesis, which posits multifunctional
parks emerge in dense, high-rent areas due to land scarcity; and the
socio-spatial hypothesis, which views parks as reflections of neighborhood
routines and preferences. Our analysis shows that parks have distinctive mobile
traffic signatures, differing from both their surroundings and from each other.
By clustering parks on temporal and app usage patterns, we identify three
functional types - lunchbreak, cultural, and recreational - with different
visitation motivations. Centrally located parks (cultural and lunchbreak)
display more diverse app use and temporal variation, while suburban
(recreational) parks reflect digital behaviors of nearby communities, with app
preferences aligned to neighborhood income. These findings demonstrate the
value of mobile traffic as a proxy for studying urban green space functions,
with implications for park planning, public health, and well-being.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In recent experiments, inorganic scintillators have been used to study the
decays of exotic nuclei, providing an alternative to silicon detectors and
enabling measurements that were previously impossible. However, proper use of
these materials requires us to understand and quantify the scintillation
process. In this work, we propose a framework based on that of Birks [Proc.
Phys. Soc. A 64, 874] and Meyer and Murray [Phys. Rev. 128, 98] to model the
light output of inorganic scintillators in response to beams of energetic heavy
ions over a broad range of energies. Our model suggests that, for sufficiently
heavy ions at high energies, the majority of the light output is associated
with the creation of delta electrons, which are induced by the passage of the
beam through the material. These delta electrons dramatically impact the
response of detection systems when subject to ions with velocities typical of
beams in modern fragmentation facilities. We test the accuracy of our model
with data from Lutetium Yttrium Orthosilicate (LYSO:Ce), a common inorganic
scintillator. We compare calculated light production and quenching factors with
experimental data for heavy ions of varying mass and energy as well as make a
quantitative estimate of the effects of delta rays on overall light output. The
model presented herein will serve as a basic framework for further studies of

<p class='card-text'>Accurate and reliable forecasting of photovoltaic (PV) power generation is
crucial for grid operations, electricity markets, and energy planning, as solar
systems now contribute a significant share of the electricity supply in many
countries. PV power forecasts are often generated by converting forecasts of
relevant weather variables to power predictions via a model chain. The use of
ensemble simulations from numerical weather prediction models results in
probabilistic PV forecasts in the form of a forecast ensemble. However, weather
forecasts often exhibit systematic errors that propagate through the model
chain, leading to biased and/or uncalibrated PV power predictions. These
deficiencies can be mitigated by statistical post-processing. Using PV
production data and corresponding short-term PV power ensemble forecasts at
seven utility-scale PV plants in Hungary, we systematically evaluate and
compare seven state-of-the-art methods for post-processing PV power forecasts.
These include both parametric and non-parametric techniques, as well as
statistical and machine learning-based approaches. Our results show that
compared to the raw PV power ensemble, any form of statistical post-processing
significantly improves the predictive performance. Non-parametric methods
outperform parametric models, with advanced nonlinear quantile regression
models showing the best results. Furthermore, machine learning-based approaches

<p class='card-text'>Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

<p class='card-text'>In many planning applications, we might be interested in finding plans that
minimally modify the initial state to achieve the goals. We refer to this
concept as plan disruption. In this paper, we formally introduce it, and define
various planning-based compilations that aim to jointly optimize both the sum
of action costs and plan disruption. Experimental results in different
benchmarks show that the reformulated task can be effectively solved in
practice to generate plans that balance both objectives.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This study investigates the sensitivity and specificity of the MapCHECK
phantom housed in MapPHAN to errors in conformal arc Stereotactic Ablative Body
Radiotherapy (SABR). A specific focus is applied to Organ At Risk (OAR)

isocentre shift errors of up to 1 mm, were introduced to 23 simulated 6 MV
X-ray conformal arc lung SABR plans in Raystation. Overall, 198 plans were
delivered on a Varian Clinac iX linear accelerator to an in-house modified

three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual

grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent

It is written in Python and has heritage from the Ackerman & Marley (2001)

and brown dwarfs. In the development of the official Virga-v1 we have retained
all the original functionality of eddysed and updated/expanded several

Mie properties, available condensate species, saturation vapor pressure curves
and formalism for fall speeds calculations. Here we benchmark Virga by
reproducing key results in the literature, including the SiO2 cloud detection

<p class='card-text'>Coordinating workflows across heterogeneous control systems remains a central
challenge in safety-critical environments such as scientific facilities,
industrial plants, and energy infrastructures. Language-model-driven agents
offer a natural interface for these tasks, but existing approaches often lack
scalability, reliability, and human oversight. We introduce the Alpha Berkeley
Framework, a production-ready architecture for scalable agentic systems that
integrate conversational context with robust tool orchestration. The framework
features dynamic capability classification to select only relevant tools per

explicit dependencies and optional human approval, context-aware task
extraction that combines dialogue history with external memory and domain
resources, and production-ready execution environments with checkpointing,
artifact management, and modular deployment. We demonstrate its versatility
through two case studies: a tutorial-style wind farm monitoring example and a

<p class='card-text'>There is a projected increase in offshore wind energy generation in the
United States over the next three decades, driven by legislative commitments
and government funding. Like other renewable technologies, the construction of
offshore wind farms has environmental impacts and spillover effects that must
be assessed. Developing offshore wind as a reliable domestic energy source
requires a multiregional analysis of economic and environmental effects of
constructing projects along lakefronts and coastal regions. Although no
commercial offshore wind farms currently operate in the United States, seven
states have announced capacity commitments exceeding 28 gigawatts by 2035. This
study evaluates the spatial economic and environmental impacts of planned
projects by linking the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Offshore
Renewables Balance-of-system Installation Tool (ORBIT) with a multiregional
input-output model of the U.S. economy developed in the Virtual Industrial
Ecology Lab. ORBIT provides capital investment requirements for installation,
which are combined with the model to estimate economic spillover effects.
Environmental impacts are assessed using a newly developed multiregional
greenhouse gas emissions dataset for the U.S. to capture supply chain emissions
of offshore wind construction. The five projects analyzed require 16.3 billion
dollars in capital investment and generate 27.6 billion dollars in direct and
indirect economic impacts across the country. Emissions results show that
states active in energy generation are most affected, but impacts can be
reduced by decarbonizing the grid. A carbon payback analysis indicates the
projects offset construction-phase emissions in less than a year. The framework
highlights which states experience the greatest spillover effects in terms of
emissions and economic activity required to support offshore wind expansion.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Medical imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound are essential for accurate diagnosis
and treatment planning in modern healthcare. However, noise contamination
during image acquisition and processing frequently degrades image quality,
obscuring critical diagnostic details and compromising clinical
decision-making. Additionally, enhancement techniques such as histogram
equalization may inadvertently amplify existing noise artifacts, including
salt-and-pepper distortions. This study investigates wavelet transform-based
denoising methods for effective noise mitigation in medical images, with the
primary objective of identifying optimal combinations of threshold values,
decomposition levels, and wavelet types to achieve superior denoising
performance and enhanced diagnostic accuracy. Through systematic evaluation
across various noise conditions, the research demonstrates that the bior6.8
biorthogonal wavelet with universal thresholding at decomposition levels 2-3
consistently achieves optimal denoising performance, providing significant
noise reduction while preserving essential anatomical structures and diagnostic
features critical for clinical applications.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-20 18:43:16</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Dexterous robotic hands enable versatile interactions due to the flexibility
and adaptability of multi-fingered designs, allowing for a wide range of
task-specific grasp configurations in diverse environments. However, to fully
exploit the capabilities of dexterous hands, access to diverse and high-quality
grasp data is essential -- whether for developing grasp prediction models from
point clouds, training manipulation policies, or supporting high-level task
planning with broader action options. Existing approaches for dataset
generation typically rely on sampling-based algorithms or simplified
force-closure analysis, which tend to converge to power grasps and often
exhibit limited diversity. In this work, we propose a method to synthesize
large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps that extend beyond simple
power grasps to include refined manipulations, such as pinches and tri-finger
precision grasps. We introduce a rigorous, differentiable energy formulation of
force closure, implicitly defined through a Quadratic Program (QP).
Additionally, we present an adjusted optimization method (MALA*) that improves
performance by dynamically rejecting gradient steps based on the distribution
of energy values across all samples. We extensively evaluate our approach and
demonstrate significant improvements in both grasp diversity and the stability
of final grasp predictions. Finally, we provide a new, large-scale grasp
dataset for 5,700 objects from DexGraspNet, comprising five different grippers
and three distinct grasp types.

future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,

scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at
scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans
develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how
intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,
Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator

large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast
outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with
rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two
novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent
reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to
help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The
Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate

<p class='card-text'>Labor shortages have severely affected the meat processing sector. Automated
technology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and
enhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly
specialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers
to buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to
develop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform
multiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry
experts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these
collaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to
ensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand
what the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a
safety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots.
For safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors
nearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human
comes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an
instrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact
between objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce
a method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an
LED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we
design a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the
human to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure
safe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's
actions which we validate through a user study.</p>

a challenging problem as it involves predicting both spatial and temporal
variations in the map due to changing conditions. We propose an informative
path planning framework to map an arbitrary number of moving targets with

approach is a spatiotemporal prediction network that predicts target position

To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided

In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is
proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend
utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and
dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance

delay and energy consumption for L-UAVs are adaptively adjusted based on
real-time energy status. The optimization tasks include assignment of tasks,
allocation of computing resources, and trajectory planning for both L-UAVs and
H-UAV. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a
reduction of at least 26% in transmission energy for L-UAVs and exhibits
superior energy stability compared to existing benchmarks.</p>
