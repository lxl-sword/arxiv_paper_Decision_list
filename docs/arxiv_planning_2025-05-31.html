<p class='card-text'>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving show promise but
falter in unstructured corner case scenarios, largely due to a scarcity of
targeted benchmarks. To address this, we introduce Impromptu VLA. Our core
contribution is the Impromptu VLA Dataset: over 80,000 meticulously curated
video clips, distilled from over 2M source clips sourced from 8 open-source
large-scale datasets. This dataset is built upon our novel taxonomy of four
challenging unstructured categories and features rich, planning-oriented
question-answering annotations and action trajectories. Crucially, experiments
demonstrate that VLAs trained with our dataset achieve substantial performance
gains on established benchmarks--improving closed-loop NeuroNCAP scores and
collision rates, and reaching near state-of-the-art L2 accuracy in open-loop
nuScenes trajectory prediction. Furthermore, our Q&A suite serves as an
effective diagnostic, revealing clear VLM improvements in perception,
prediction, and planning. Our code, data and models are available at

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-29 17:51:40</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This review focuses on the computerized modeling of the electrophysiology of
the human atria, emphasizing the simulation of common arrhythmias such as
atrial flutter (AFlut) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). Which components of the
model are necessary to accurately model arrhythmogenic tissue modifications,
including remodeling, cardiomyopathy, and fibrosis, to ensure reliable
simulations? The central question explored is the level of detail required for
trustworthy simulations for a specific context of use. The review discusses the
balance between model complexity and computational efficiency, highlighting the
risks of oversimplification and excessive detail. It covers various aspects of
atrial modeling, from cellular to whole atria levels, including the influence
of atrial geometry, fiber direction, anisotropy, and wall thickness on
simulation outcomes. The article also examines the impact of different modeling
approaches, such as volumetric 3D models, bilayer models, and single surface
models, on the realism of simulations. In addition, it reviews the latest
advances in the modeling of fibrotic tissue and the verification and validation
of atrial models. The intended use of these models in planning and optimization
of atrial ablation strategies is discussed, with a focus on personalized
modeling for individual patients and cohort-based approaches for broader
applications. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of integrating
experimental data and clinical validation to enhance the utility of
computerized atrial models to improve patient outcomes.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurately localizing the brain regions that triggers seizures and predicting
whether a patient will be seizure-free after surgery are vital for surgical
planning and patient management in drug-resistant epilepsy.
Stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) delivers high-fidelity intracranial
recordings that enable clinicians to precisely locate epileptogenic networks.
However, the clinical identification is subjective and dependent on the
expertise of the clinical team. Data driven approaches in this domain are
sparse, despite the fact that sEEG offers high temporal-fidelity related to
seizure dynamics that can be leveraged using graph structures ideal for
imitating brain networks. In this study, we introduce a dual-task graph-neural
network (GNN) framework that operates on windowed sEEG recordings to jointly
predict seizure-freedom outcomes and identify seizure-onset-zone (SOZ)
channels. We assemble non-overlapping 10 second windows from 51 clinical
seizures spread across 20 pediatric patients, with sEEG data annotated by
clinical experts. For each temporal window we construct a functional
connectivity graph via thresholded Pearson correlations and extract rich node
features (spectral, statistical, wavelet, Hjorth and local graph features),
alongside six global graph descriptors. We optimize a combined cross-entropy
loss with a tunable task-weight, and select model hyper-parameters via Optuna.
Under window-level 10-fold cross-validation, the model achieves a mean
graph-level accuracy of $89.31 \pm 0.0976 \%$ for seizure-freedom prediction
and a node-level SOZ localization accuracy of $94.72. \pm 0.0041 \%$. For the
best performing model, we ran additive and leave-one-out ablation studies to
explore feature importance for graph and node-level accuracy.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Classical search algorithms have long underpinned modern artificial
intelligence. In this work, we tackle the challenge of inference-time control
in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time
objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general
framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the
generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed
Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using
breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range
of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and
image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both
performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a

<p class='card-text'>Mobile GUI agents aim to autonomously complete user-instructed tasks across
mobile apps. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable
these agents to interpret UI screens, identify actionable elements, and perform
interactions such as tapping or typing. However, existing agents remain
reactive: they reason only over the current screen and lack a structured model
of app navigation flow, limiting their ability to understand context, detect
unexpected outcomes, and recover from errors. We present MAPLE, a state-aware
multi-agent framework that abstracts app interactions as a Finite State Machine
(FSM). We computationally model each UI screen as a discrete state and user
actions as transitions, allowing the FSM to provide a structured representation
of the app execution. MAPLE consists of specialized agents responsible for four
phases of task execution: planning, execution, verification, error recovery,
and knowledge retention. These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs
in real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing
the GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes
through pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by
rolling back to previously stable states. Our evaluation results on two
challenging cross-app benchmarks, Mobile-Eval-E and SPA-Bench, show that MAPLE
outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, improving task success rate by up to
12%, recovery success by 13.8%, and action accuracy by 6.5%. Our results
highlight the importance of structured state modeling in guiding mobile GUI
agents during task execution. Moreover, our FSM representation can be
integrated into future GUI agent architectures as a lightweight, model-agnostic
memory layer to support structured planning, execution verification, and error
recovery.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-29 14:57:34</h6>
<p class='card-text'>People employ efficient planning strategies. But how are these strategies
acquired? Previous research suggests that people can discover new planning
strategies through learning from reinforcements, a process known as
metacognitive reinforcement learning (MCRL). While prior work has shown that
MCRL models can learn new planning strategies and explain more participants'
experience-driven discovery better than alternative mechanisms, it also
revealed significant individual differences in metacognitive learning.
Furthermore, when fitted to human data, these models exhibit a slower rate of
strategy discovery than humans. In this study, we investigate whether
incorporating cognitive mechanisms that might facilitate human strategy
discovery can bring models of MCRL closer to human performance. Specifically,
we consider intrinsically generated metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective
effort valuation, and termination deliberation. Analysis of planning task data
shows that a larger proportion of participants used at least one of these
mechanisms, with significant individual differences in their usage and varying
impacts on strategy discovery. Metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective effort
valuation, and learning the value of acting without further planning were found
to facilitate strategy discovery. While these enhancements provided valuable
insights into individual differences and the effect of these mechanisms on
strategy discovery, they did not fully close the gap between model and human
performance, prompting further exploration of additional factors that people
might use to discover new planning strategies.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become essential tools in inspection and
emergency response operations due to their high maneuverability and ability to
access hard-to-reach areas. However, their limited battery life significantly
restricts their use in long-duration missions. This paper presents a novel
tethered marsupial robotic system composed of a UAV and an Unmanned Ground
Vehicle (UGV), specifically designed for autonomous, long-duration inspection
tasks in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. The
system extends the UAV's operational time by supplying power through a tether
connected to high-capacity battery packs carried by the UGV. We detail the
hardware architecture based on off-the-shelf components to ensure replicability
and describe our full-stack software framework, which is composed of
open-source components and built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS). The
proposed software architecture enables precise localization using a Direct
LiDAR Localization (DLL) method and ensures safe path planning and coordinated
trajectory tracking for the integrated UGV-tether-UAV system. We validate the
system through three field experiments: (1) a manual flight endurance test to
estimate the operational duration, (2) an autonomous navigation test, and (3)
an inspection mission to demonstrate autonomous inspection capabilities.
Experimental results confirm the robustness and autonomy of the system, its
capacity to operate in GNSS-denied environments, and its potential for
long-endurance, autonomous inspection and monitoring tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Long-horizon robotic manipulation poses significant challenges for autonomous
systems, requiring extended reasoning, precise execution, and robust error
recovery across complex sequential tasks. Current approaches, whether based on
static planning or end-to-end visuomotor policies, suffer from error
accumulation and lack effective verification mechanisms during execution,
limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. We present Agentic Robot, a
brain-inspired framework that addresses these limitations through Standardized
Action Procedures (SAP)--a novel coordination protocol governing component
interactions throughout manipulation tasks. Drawing inspiration from
Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) in human organizations, SAP
establishes structured workflows for planning, execution, and verification
phases. Our architecture comprises three specialized components: (1) a large
reasoning model that decomposes high-level instructions into semantically
coherent subgoals, (2) a vision-language-action executor that generates
continuous control commands from real-time visual inputs, and (3) a temporal
verifier that enables autonomous progression and error recovery through
introspective assessment. This SAP-driven closed-loop design supports dynamic
self-verification without external supervision. On the LIBERO benchmark,
Agentic Robot achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average success
rate of 79.6\%, outperforming SpatialVLA by 6.1\% and OpenVLA by 7.4\% on
long-horizon tasks. These results demonstrate that SAP-driven coordination
between specialized components enhances both performance and interpretability

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-29 13:19:29</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We introduce CTIM-Rover, an AI agent for Software Engineering (SE) built on
top of AutoCodeRover (Zhang et al., 2024) that extends agentic reasoning
frameworks with an episodic memory, more specifically, a general and
repository-level Cross-Task-Instance Memory (CTIM). While existing open-source
SE agents mostly rely on ReAct (Yao et al., 2023b), Reflexion (Shinn et al.,
2023), or Code-Act (Wang et al., 2024), all of these reasoning and planning
frameworks inefficiently discard their long-term memory after a single task
instance. As repository-level understanding is pivotal for identifying all
locations requiring a patch for fixing a bug, we hypothesize that SE is
particularly well positioned to benefit from CTIM. For this, we build on the
Experiential Learning (EL) approach ExpeL (Zhao et al., 2024), proposing a
Mixture-Of-Experts (MoEs) inspired approach to create both a general-purpose
and repository-level CTIM. We find that CTIM-Rover does not outperform
AutoCodeRover in any configuration and thus conclude that neither ExpeL nor
DoT-Bank (Lingam et al., 2024) scale to real-world SE problems. Our analysis
indicates noise introduced by distracting CTIM items or exemplar trajectories

<p class='card-text'>Detecting forged remote sensing images is becoming increasingly critical, as
such imagery plays a vital role in environmental monitoring, urban planning,
and national security. While diffusion models have emerged as the dominant
paradigm for image generation, their impact on remote sensing forgery detection
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks primarily target GAN-based forgeries
or focus on natural images, limiting progress in this critical domain. To
address this gap, we introduce RSFAKE-1M, a large-scale dataset of 500K forged
and 500K real remote sensing images. The fake images are generated by ten
diffusion models fine-tuned on remote sensing data, covering six generation
conditions such as text prompts, structural guidance, and inpainting. This
paper presents the construction of RSFAKE-1M along with a comprehensive
experimental evaluation using both existing detectors and unified baselines.
The results reveal that diffusion-based remote sensing forgeries remain
challenging for current methods, and that models trained on RSFAKE-1M exhibit
notably improved generalization and robustness. Our findings underscore the

pathplanning methods, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have proven
effective but often encounter significant challenges. These include high search
space complexity, suboptimal path quality, and slow convergence, issues that
are particularly problematic in high-stakes applications like disaster

limitations and enhance path-planning efficiency, we propose Vision Language
Model RRT (VLM-RRT), a hybrid approach that integrates the pattern recognition
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the path-planning strengths
of RRT. By leveraging VLMs to provide initial directional guidance based on
environmental snapshots, our method biases sampling toward regions more likely

<p class='card-text'>Photo retouching is integral to photographic art, extending far beyond simple
technical fixes to heighten emotional expression and narrative depth. While
artists leverage expertise to create unique visual effects through deliberate
adjustments, non-professional users often rely on automated tools that produce
visually pleasing results but lack interpretative depth and interactive
transparency. In this paper, we introduce PhotoArtAgent, an intelligent system
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with advanced natural language
reasoning to emulate the creative process of a professional artist. The agent
performs explicit artistic analysis, plans retouching strategies, and outputs
precise parameters to Lightroom through an API. It then evaluates the resulting
images and iteratively refines them until the desired artistic vision is
achieved. Throughout this process, PhotoArtAgent provides transparent,

<p class='card-text'>Accurately predicting 3D occupancy grids from visual inputs is critical for
autonomous driving, but current discriminative methods struggle with noisy
data, incomplete observations, and the complex structures inherent in 3D
scenes. In this work, we reframe 3D occupancy prediction as a generative
modeling task using diffusion models, which learn the underlying data
distribution and incorporate 3D scene priors. This approach enhances prediction
consistency, noise robustness, and better handles the intricacies of 3D spatial
structures. Our extensive experiments show that diffusion-based generative
models outperform state-of-the-art discriminative approaches, delivering more
realistic and accurate occupancy predictions, especially in occluded or
low-visibility regions. Moreover, the improved predictions significantly
benefit downstream planning tasks, highlighting the practical advantages of our
method for real-world autonomous driving applications.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The ABB YuMi is a 7-DOF collaborative robot arm with a complex, redundant
kinematic structure. Path planning for the YuMi is challenging, especially with
joint limits considered. The redundant degree of freedom is parameterized by
the Shoulder-Elbow-Wrist (SEW) angle, called the arm angle by ABB, but the
exact definition must be known for path planning outside the RobotStudio
simulator. We provide the first complete and validated definition of the SEW
angle used for the YuMi. It follows the conventional SEW angle formulation with
the shoulder-elbow direction chosen to be the direction of the fourth joint
axis. Our definition also specifies the shoulder location, making it compatible
with any choice of reference vector. A previous attempt to define the SEW angle
exists in the literature, but it is incomplete and deviates from the behavior
observed in RobotStudio. Because our formulation fits within the general SEW
angle framework, we also obtain the expression for the SEW angle Jacobian and
complete numerical conditions for all algorithmic singularities. Finally, we
demonstrate using IK-Geo, our inverse kinematics (IK) solver based on
subproblem decomposition, to find all IK solutions using 2D search. Code
examples are available in a publicly accessible repository.</p>

  Super-Resolution via Vision-Language Model</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Bowen Chen, Keyan Chen, Mohan Yang, Zhengxia Zou, Zhenwei Shi</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-29 02:38:34</h6>
<p class='card-text'>High-resolution (HR) remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in a wide
range of applications, including urban planning and environmental monitoring.
However, due to limitations in sensors and data transmission links, the images
acquired in practice often suffer from resolution degradation. Remote Sensing
Image Super-Resolution (RSISR) aims to reconstruct HR images from
low-resolution (LR) inputs, providing a cost-effective and efficient
alternative to direct HR image acquisition. Existing RSISR methods primarily
focus on low-level characteristics in pixel space, while neglecting the
high-level understanding of remote sensing scenes. This may lead to
semantically inconsistent artifacts in the reconstructed results. Motivated by
this observation, our work aims to explore the role of high-level semantic
knowledge in improving RSISR performance. We propose a Semantic-Guided
Super-Resolution framework, SeG-SR, which leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to extract semantic knowledge from input images and uses it to guide the
super resolution (SR) process. Specifically, we first design a Semantic Feature
Extraction Module (SFEM) that utilizes a pretrained VLM to extract semantic
knowledge from remote sensing images. Next, we propose a Semantic Localization
Module (SLM), which derives a series of semantic guidance from the extracted
semantic knowledge. Finally, we develop a Learnable Modulation Module (LMM)
that uses semantic guidance to modulate the features extracted by the SR
network, effectively incorporating high-level scene understanding into the SR
pipeline. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of SeG-SR through
extensive experiments: SeG-SR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
datasets and consistently delivers performance improvements across various SR
architectures. Codes can be found at https://github.com/Mr-Bamboo/SeG-SR.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-29 01:28:57</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The ability to simulate the world in a spatially consistent manner is a
crucial requirements for effective world models. Such a model enables
high-quality visual generation, and also ensures the reliability of world
models for downstream tasks such as simulation and planning. Designing a memory
module is a crucial component for addressing spatial consistency: such a model
must not only retain long-horizon observational information, but also enables
the construction of explicit or implicit internal spatial representations.
However, there are no dataset designed to promote the development of memory
modules by explicitly enforcing spatial consistency constraints. Furthermore,
most existing benchmarks primarily emphasize visual coherence or generation
quality, neglecting the requirement of long-range spatial consistency. To
bridge this gap, we construct a dataset and corresponding benchmark by sampling
150 distinct locations within the open-world environment of Minecraft,
collecting about 250 hours (20 million frames) of loop-based navigation videos
with actions. Our dataset follows a curriculum design of sequence lengths,
allowing models to learn spatial consistency on increasingly complex navigation
trajectories. Furthermore, our data collection pipeline is easily extensible to
new Minecraft environments and modules. Four representative world model
baselines are evaluated on our benchmark. Dataset, benchmark, and code are
open-sourced to support future research.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper presents a system for autonomous semantic exploration and dense
semantic target mapping of a complex unknown environment using a ground robot
equipped with a LiDAR-panoramic camera suite. Existing approaches often
struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view
angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we
propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the
task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation.
We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel
Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This
enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without
unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to
ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive
Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while
ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic
target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM
algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our
approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and
complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner
achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a
specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further
confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object
mapping of unstructured environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Tasks that involve complex interactions between objects with unknown dynamics
make planning before execution difficult. These tasks require agents to
iteratively improve their actions after actively exploring causes and effects
in the environment. For these type of tasks, we propose Causal-PIK, a method
that leverages Bayesian optimization to reason about causal interactions via a
Physics-Informed Kernel to help guide efficient search for the best next
action. Experimental results on Virtual Tools and PHYRE physical reasoning
benchmarks show that Causal-PIK outperforms state-of-the-art results, requiring
fewer actions to reach the goal. We also compare Causal-PIK to human studies,
including results from a new user study we conducted on the PHYRE benchmark. We

<p class='card-text'>Assembly theory has received considerable attention in the recent past. Here
we analyze the formal framework of this model and show that assembly pathways
coincide with certain minimal hyperpaths in B-hypergraphs. This makes it
possible to generalize the notion of assembly to general chemical reaction

in particular DPO graph rewriting. We observe, furthermore, that assembly
theory is closely related to retrosynthetic analysis in chemistry. The assembly
index fits seamlessly into a large family of cost measures for directed
hyperpath problems that also encompasses cost functions used in computational
synthesis planning. This allows to devise a generic approach to compute
complexity measures derived from minimal hyperpaths in rule-derived directed
hypergraphs using integer linear programming.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Scientific embodied agents play a crucial role in modern laboratories by
automating complex experimental workflows. Compared to typical household
environments, laboratory settings impose significantly higher demands on
perception of physical-chemical transformations and long-horizon planning,
making them an ideal testbed for advancing embodied intelligence. However, its
development has been long hampered by the lack of suitable simulator and
benchmarks. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing LabUtopia, a
comprehensive simulation and benchmarking suite designed to facilitate the
development of generalizable, reasoning-capable embodied agents in laboratory
settings. Specifically, it integrates i) LabSim, a high-fidelity simulator
supporting multi-physics and chemically meaningful interactions; ii) LabScene,
a scalable procedural generator for diverse scientific scenes; and iii)
LabBench, a hierarchical benchmark spanning five levels of complexity from
atomic actions to long-horizon mobile manipulation. LabUtopia supports 30
distinct tasks and includes more than 200 scene and instrument assets, enabling
large-scale training and principled evaluation in high-complexity environments.
We demonstrate that LabUtopia offers a powerful platform for advancing the
integration of perception, planning, and control in scientific-purpose agents

<p class='card-text'>In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been widely tested
using tools like OpenAI Gym, though many tasks in these environments could also
benefit from hierarchical planning. However, there is a lack of a tool that
enables seamless integration of hierarchical planning with RL. Hierarchical
Domain Definition Language (HDDL), used in classical planning, introduces a
structured approach well-suited for model-based RL to address this gap. To
bridge this integration, we introduce HDDLGym, a Python-based tool that
automatically generates OpenAI Gym environments from HDDL domains and problems.
HDDLGym serves as a link between RL and hierarchical planning, supporting
multi-agent scenarios and enabling collaborative planning among agents. This
paper provides an overview of HDDLGym's design and implementation, highlighting
the challenges and design choices involved in integrating HDDL with the Gym
interface, and applying RL policies to support hierarchical planning. We also
provide detailed instructions and demonstrations for using the HDDLGym
framework, including how to work with existing HDDL domains and problems from
International Planning Competitions, exemplified by the Transport domain.
Additionally, we offer guidance on creating new HDDL domains for multi-agent
scenarios and demonstrate the practical use of HDDLGym in the Overcooked
domain. By leveraging the advantages of HDDL and Gym, HDDLGym aims to be a
valuable tool for studying RL in hierarchical planning, particularly in

<p class='card-text'>The synthesis of Ohman's VCV sequences with intervocalic plosive consonants
was first achieved 30 years ago using the DRM model. However, this approach
remains primarily acoustic and lacks articulatory constraints. In this study,
the same 75 VCVs are analyzed, but generated with the Maeda model, using
trajectory planning that differentiates vowel-to-vowel transitions from
consonantal influences. Synthetic data exhibit similar characteristics to
Ohman's sequences, including the presence of S-shaped F2 trajectories.
Furthermore, locus equations (LEs) for F2 and F3 are computed from synthetic CV
data to investigate their underlying determinism, leading to a reassessment of
conventional interpretations. The findings indicate that, although articulatory

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in world models have revolutionized dynamic environment
simulation, allowing systems to foresee future states and assess potential
actions. In autonomous driving, these capabilities help vehicles anticipate the
behavior of other road users, perform risk-aware planning, accelerate training
in simulation, and adapt to novel scenarios, thereby enhancing safety and
reliability. Current approaches exhibit deficiencies in maintaining robust 3D
geometric consistency or accumulating artifacts during occlusion handling, both
critical for reliable safety assessment in autonomous navigation tasks. To
address this, we introduce GeoDrive, which explicitly integrates robust 3D
geometry conditions into driving world models to enhance spatial understanding
and action controllability. Specifically, we first extract a 3D representation
from the input frame and then obtain its 2D rendering based on the
user-specified ego-car trajectory. To enable dynamic modeling, we propose a
dynamic editing module during training to enhance the renderings by editing the
positions of the vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models in both action accuracy and 3D

<p class='card-text'>The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will enable direct observations

astrophysical and cosmological phenomena. LISA's heterodyne interferometric
measurement system requires phase-locking five of its six onboard lasers with
tunable frequency offsets to ensure that all beatnotes remain within the
metrology system's operational range, despite Doppler-induced frequency shifts.
The selection of these offset frequencies -- collectively forming a frequency

orbital dynamics and instrument limitations. While previous work established an
algorithmic solution for deriving time-dependent frequency plans, this study
takes a complementary approach by systematically analyzing and cataloging all
possible laser locking configurations. We present an automated method to
explore, validate, and classify viable locking schemes, identifying 36 unique
non-frequency-swapping configurations and 72 additional frequency-swapping
