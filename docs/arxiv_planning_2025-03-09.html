<p class='card-text'>This paper develops a granular regime-switching framework to model mortality
deviations from seasonal baseline trends driven by temperature- and
epidemic-related shocks. The framework features three states: (1) a baseline
state that captures observed seasonal mortality patterns, (2) an environmental
shock state for heat waves, and (3) a respiratory shock state that addresses
mortality deviations caused by strong outbreaks of respiratory diseases due to
influenza and COVID-19. Transition probabilities between states are modeled
using covariate-dependent multinomial logit functions. These functions
incorporate, among others, lagged temperature and influenza incidence rates as
predictors, allowing dynamic adjustments to evolving shocks. Calibrated on
weekly mortality data across 21 French regions and six age groups, the
regime-switching framework accounts for spatial and demographic heterogeneity.
Under various projection scenarios for temperature and influenza, we quantify
uncertainty in mortality forecasts through prediction intervals constructed
using an extensive bootstrap approach. These projections can guide healthcare
providers and hospitals in managing risks and planning resources for potential
future shocks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Epidemics exhibit interconnected processes that operate at multiple time and
organizational scales, a hallmark of complex adaptive systems. Modern
epidemiological modeling frameworks incorporate feedback between
individual-level behavioral choices and centralized interventions. Nonetheless,
the realistic operational course for disease detection, planning, and response
is often overlooked. Disease detection is a dynamic challenge, shaped by the
interplay between surveillance efforts and transmission characteristics. It
serves as a tipping point that triggers emergency declarations, information
dissemination, adaptive behavioral responses, and the deployment of public
health interventions. Evaluating the impact of disease surveillance systems as
triggers for adaptive behavior and public health interventions is key to
designing effective control policies.
  We examine the multiple behavioral and epidemiological dynamics generated by
the feedback between disease surveillance and the intertwined dynamics of
information and disease propagation. Specifically, we study the intertwined
dynamics between: $(i)$ disease surveillance triggering health emergency
declarations, $(ii)$ risk information dissemination producing decentralized
behavioral responses, and $(iii)$ centralized interventions. Our results show
that robust surveillance systems that quickly detect a disease outbreak can
trigger an early response from the population, leading to large epidemic sizes.
The key result is that the response scenarios that minimize the final epidemic
size are determined by the trade-off between the risk information dissemination
and disease transmission, with the triggering effect of surveillance mediating
this trade-off. Finally, our results confirm that behavioral adaptation can
create a hysteresis-like effect on the final epidemic size.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Promoting active mobility like cycling relies on the availability of
well-connected, high-quality bicycle networks. However, expanding these
networks over an extended planning horizon presents one of the most complex
challenges in transport science. This complexity arises from the intricate
interactions between infrastructure availability and usage, such as network
spillover effects and mode choice substitutions. In this paper, we approach the
problem from two perspectives: direct optimization methods, which generate
near-optimal solutions using operations research techniques, and conceptual
heuristics, which offer intuitive and scalable algorithms grounded in network
science. Specifically, we compare direct welfare optimization with an inverse
network percolation approach to planning cycle superhighway extensions in
Copenhagen. Interestingly, while the more complex optimization models yield
better overall welfare results, the improvements over simpler methods are
small. More importantly, we demonstrate that the increased complexity of
planning approaches generally makes them more vulnerable to input uncertainty,
reflecting the bias-variance tradeoff. This issue is particularly relevant in
the context of long-term planning, where conditions change during the
implementation of the planned infrastructure expansions. Therefore, while
planning bicycle infrastructure is important and renders exceptionally high
benefit-cost ratios, considerations of robustness and ease of implementation
may justify the use of more straightforward network-based methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Datasets for object detection often do not account for enough variety of
glasses, due to their transparent and reflective properties. Specifically,
open-vocabulary object detectors, widely used in embodied robotic agents, fail
to distinguish subclasses of glasses. This scientific gap poses an issue to
robotic applications that suffer from accumulating errors between detection,
planning, and action execution. The paper introduces a novel method for the
acquisition of real-world data from RGB-D sensors that minimizes human effort.
We propose an auto-labeling pipeline that generates labels for all the acquired
frames based on the depth measurements. We provide a novel real-world glass
object dataset that was collected on the Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator (NICOL), a
humanoid robot platform. The data set consists of 7850 images recorded from
five different cameras. We show that our trained baseline model outperforms
state-of-the-art open-vocabulary approaches. In addition, we deploy our
baseline model in an embodied agent approach to the NICOL platform, on which it
achieves a success rate of 81% in a human-robot bartending scenario.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Magnetic-field simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using
consumer-grade inertial and magnetometer sensors offers a scalable,
cost-effective solution for indoor localization. However, the rapid error
accumulation in the inertial navigation process limits the feasible exploratory
phases of these systems. Advances in magnetometer array processing have
demonstrated that odometry information, i.e., displacement and rotation
information, can be extracted from local magnetic field variations and used to
create magnetic-field odometry-aided inertial navigation systems. The error
growth rate of these systems is significantly lower than that of standalone
inertial navigation systems. This study seeks an answer to whether a
magnetic-field SLAM system fed with measurements from a magnetometer array can
indirectly extract odometry information -- without requiring algorithmic
modifications -- and thus sustain longer exploratory phases. The theoretical
analysis and simulation results show that such a system can extract odometry

<p class='card-text'>With the continued migration of storage to cloud database systems,the impact
of slow queries in such systems on services and user experience is increasing.
Root-cause diagnosis plays an indispensable role in facilitating slow-query
detection and revision. This paper proposes a method capable of both
identifying possible root cause types for slow queries and ranking these
according to their potential for accelerating slow queries. This enables
prioritizing root causes with the highest impact, in turn improving slow-query
revision effectiveness. To enable more accurate and detailed diagnoses, we
propose the multimodal Ranking for the Root Causes of slow queries (RCRank)
framework, which formulates root cause analysis as a multimodal machine
learning problem and leverages multimodal information from query statements,
execution plans, execution logs, and key performance indicators. To obtain
expressive embeddings from its heterogeneous multimodal input, RCRank
integrates self-supervised pre-training that enhances cross-modal alignment and
task relevance. Next, the framework integrates root-cause-adaptive cross
Transformers that enable adaptive fusion of multimodal features with varying
characteristics. Finally, the framework offers a unified model that features an
impact-aware training objective for identifying and ranking root causes. We
report on experiments on real and synthetic datasets, finding that RCRank is
capable of consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art methods at root
cause identification and ranking according to a range of metrics.</p>

<p class='card-text'>One of the fundamental tasks of autonomous driving is safe trajectory
planning, the task of deciding where the vehicle needs to drive, while avoiding
obstacles, obeying safety rules, and respecting the fundamental limits of road.
Real-world application of such a method involves consideration of surrounding
environment conditions and movements such as Lane Change, collision avoidance,
and lane merge. The focus of the paper is to develop and implement safe
collision free highway Lane Change trajectory using high order polynomial for
Highly Automated Driving Function (HADF). Planning is often considered as a
higher-level process than control. Behavior Planning Module (BPM) is designed
that plans the high-level driving actions like Lane Change maneuver to safely
achieve the functionality of transverse guidance ensuring safety of the vehicle
using motion planning in a scenario including environmental situation. Based on
the recommendation received from the (BPM), the function will generate a desire
corresponding trajectory. The proposed planning system is situation specific
with polynomial based algorithm for same direction two lane highway scenario.
To support the trajectory system polynomial curve can be used to reduces
overall complexity and thereby allows rapid computation. The proposed Lane
Change scenario is modeled, and results has been analyzed (verified and
validate) through the MATLAB simulation environment. The method proposed in
this paper has achieved a significant improvement in safety and stability of
Lane Changing maneuver.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Navigating urban environments poses significant challenges for people with
disabilities, particularly those with blindness and low vision. Environments

<p class='card-text'>The Detection Transformer (DETR), by incorporating the Hungarian algorithm,
has significantly simplified the matching process in object detection tasks.
This algorithm facilitates optimal one-to-one matching of predicted bounding
boxes to ground-truth annotations during training. While effective, this strict
matching process does not inherently account for the varying densities and
distributions of objects, leading to suboptimal correspondences such as failing
to handle multiple detections of the same object or missing small objects. To
address this, we propose the Regularized Transport Plan (RTP). RTP introduces a
flexible matching strategy that captures the cost of aligning predictions with
ground truths to find the most accurate correspondences between these sets. By
utilizing the differentiable Sinkhorn algorithm, RTP allows for soft,
fractional matching rather than strict one-to-one assignments. This approach
enhances the model's capability to manage varying object densities and
distributions effectively. Our extensive evaluations on the MS-COCO and VOC

compositional structures-which organize and visualize individual elements into

<p class='card-text'>Manipulating a deformable linear object (DLO) such as wire, cable, and rope
is a common yet challenging task due to their high degrees of freedom and
complex deformation behaviors, especially in an environment with obstacles.
Existing local control methods are efficient but prone to failure in complex
scenarios, while precise global planners are computationally intensive and
difficult to deploy. This paper presents an efficient, easy-to-deploy framework
for collision-free DLO manipulation using mobile manipulators. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of leveraging standard planning tools for high-dimensional
DLO manipulation without requiring custom planners or extensive data-driven
models. Our approach combines an off-the-shelf global planner with a real-time
local controller. The global planner approximates the DLO as a series of rigid
links connected by spherical joints, enabling rapid path planning without the
need for problem-specific planners or large datasets. The local controller
employs control barrier functions (CBFs) to enforce safety constraints,
maintain the DLO integrity, prevent overstress, and handle obstacle avoidance.
It compensates for modeling inaccuracies by using a state-of-the-art
position-based dynamics technique that approximates physical properties like
Young's and shear moduli. We validate our framework through extensive
simulations and real-world demonstrations. In complex obstacle
scenarios-including tent pole transport, corridor navigation, and tasks
requiring varied stiffness-our method achieves a 100% success rate over
thousands of trials, with significantly reduced planning times compared to
state-of-the-art techniques. Real-world experiments include transportation of a

<p class='card-text'>We address the long-horizon mapless navigation problem: enabling robots to
traverse novel environments without relying on high-definition maps or precise
waypoints that specify exactly where to navigate. Achieving this requires
overcoming two major challenges -- learning robust, generalizable perceptual
representations of the environment without pre-enumerating all possible
navigation factors and forms of perceptual aliasing and utilizing these learned
representations to plan human-aligned navigation paths. Existing solutions
struggle to generalize due to their reliance on hand-curated object lists that
overlook unforeseen factors, end-to-end learning of navigation features from
scarce large-scale robot datasets, and handcrafted reward functions that scale
poorly to diverse scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose CREStE,
the first method that learns representations and rewards for addressing the
full mapless navigation problem without relying on large-scale robot datasets
or manually curated features. CREStE leverages visual foundation models trained
on internet-scale data to learn continuous bird's-eye-view representations
capturing elevation, semantics, and instance-level features. To utilize learned
representations for planning, we propose a counterfactual-based loss and active

humans for counterfactual trajectory annotations in challenging scenes. We
evaluate CREStE in kilometer-scale navigation tasks across six distinct urban

<p class='card-text'>Automating labor-intensive tasks such as crop monitoring with robots is
essential for enhancing production and conserving resources. However,
autonomously monitoring horticulture crops remains challenging due to their
complex structures, which often result in fruit occlusions. Existing view
planning methods attempt to reduce occlusions but either struggle to achieve
adequate coverage or incur high robot motion costs. We introduce a global
optimization approach for view motion planning that aims to minimize robot
motion costs while maximizing fruit coverage. To this end, we leverage coverage
constraints derived from the set covering problem (SCP) within a shortest
Hamiltonian path problem (SHPP) formulation. While both SCP and SHPP are
well-established, their tailored integration enables a unified framework that
computes a global view path with minimized motion while ensuring full coverage
of selected targets. Given the NP-hard nature of the problem, we employ a
region-prior-based selection of coverage targets and a sparse graph structure
to achieve effective optimization outcomes within a limited time. Experiments
in simulation demonstrate that our method detects more fruits, enhances surface

baseline with a moderate increase in motion cost, while significantly reducing
motion costs compared to the coverage-focused baseline. Real-world experiments

of space missions. Orbits in cislunar space are influenced by the gravitational
forces of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and other Solar System planets leading to
typically unpredictable and chaotic behavior. It is therefore difficult to
predict the stability of an orbit from a set of initial orbital elements. We
simulate one million cislunar orbits and use a self-organizing map (SOM) to
cluster the orbits into families based on how long they remain stable within
the cislunar regime. Utilizing Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL)
High Performance Computers (HPC) we develop a highly adaptable SOM capable of
efficiently characterizing observations from individual events. We are able to
predict the lifetime from the initial three line element (TLE) to within 10
percent for 8 percent of the test dataset, within 50 percent for 43 percent of
the dataset, and within 100 percent for 75 percent of the dataset. The
fractional absolute deviation peaks at 1 for all lifetimes. Multi-modal
clustering in the SOM suggests that a variety of orbital morphologies have
similar lifetimes. The trained SOMs use an average of 2.73 milliseconds of
computational time to produce an orbital stability prediction. The outcomes of
this research enhance our understanding of cislunar orbital dynamics and also
provide insights for mission planning, enabling the rapid identification of
stable orbital regions and pathways for future space exploration. As
demonstrated in this study, an SOM can generate orbital lifetime estimates from
minimal observational data, such as a single TLE, making it essential for early
warning systems and large-scale sensor network operations.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The partial alignment and conflict of autonomous agents lead to mixed-motive
scenarios in many real-world applications. However, agents may fail to
cooperate in practice even when cooperation yields a better outcome. One well
known reason for this failure comes from non-credible commitments. To
facilitate commitments among agents for better cooperation, we define Markov
Commitment Games (MCGs), a variant of commitment games, where agents can
voluntarily commit to their proposed future plans. Based on MCGs, we propose a
learnable commitment protocol via policy gradients. We further propose
incentive-compatible learning to accelerate convergence to equilibria with
better social welfare. Experimental results in challenging mixed-motive tasks
demonstrate faster empirical convergence and higher returns for our method
compared with its counterparts. Our code is available at

<p class='card-text'>Optimal transport has found widespread applications in signal processing and
machine learning. Among its many equivalent formulations, optimal transport
seeks to reconstruct a random variable/vector with a prescribed distribution at
the destination while minimizing the expected distortion relative to a given
random variable/vector at the source. However, in practice, certain constraints
may render the optimal transport plan infeasible. In this work, we consider
three types of constraints: rate constraints, dimension constraints, and
channel constraints, motivated by perception-aware lossy compression,
generative principal component analysis, and deep joint source-channel coding,
respectively. Special attenion is given to the setting termed Gaussian
Wasserstein optimal transport, where both the source and reconstruction
variables are multivariate Gaussian, and the end-to-end distortion is measured
by the mean squared error. We derive explicit results for the minimum
achievable mean squared error under the three aforementioned constraints when
the covariance matrices of the source and reconstruction variables commute.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The advancement of visual language models (VLMs) has enhanced mobile device
operations, allowing simulated human-like actions to address user requirements.
Current VLM-based mobile operating assistants can be structured into three
levels: task, subtask, and action. The subtask level, linking high-level goals
with low-level executable actions, is crucial for task completion but faces two
challenges: ineffective subtasks that lower-level agent cannot execute and
inefficient subtasks that fail to contribute to the completion of the
higher-level task. These challenges stem from VLM's lack of experience in
decomposing subtasks within GUI scenarios in multi-agent architecture. To
address these, we propose a new mobile assistant architecture with constrained
high-frequency o}ptimized planning (CHOP). Our approach overcomes the VLM's
deficiency in GUI scenarios planning by using human-planned subtasks as the
basis vector. We evaluate our architecture in both English and Chinese contexts
across 20 Apps, demonstrating significant improvements in both effectiveness

<p class='card-text'>The electrification of road transport, as the predominant mode of
transportation in Africa, represents a great opportunity to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions and dependence on costly fuel imports. However, it introduces
major challenges for local energy infrastructures, including the deployment of
charging stations and the impact on often fragile electricity grids. Despite
its importance, research on electric mobility planning in Africa remains
limited, while existing planning tools rely on detailed local mobility data
that is often unavailable, especially for privately owned passenger vehicles.
In this study, we introduce a novel framework designed to support private
vehicle electrification in data-scarce regions and apply it to Addis Ababa,
simulating the mobility patterns and charging needs of 100,000 electric
vehicles. Our analysis indicate that these vehicles generate a daily charging
demand of approximately 350 MWh and emphasize the significant influence of the
charging location on the spatial and temporal distribution of this demand.
Notably, charging at public places can help smooth the charging demand
throughout the day, mitigating peak charging loads on the electricity grid. We
also estimate charging station requirements, finding that workplace charging
requires approximately one charging point per three electric vehicles, while
public charging requires only one per thirty. Finally, we demonstrate that
photovoltaic energy can cover a substantial share of the charging needs,
emphasizing the potential for renewable energy integration. This study lays the
groundwork for electric mobility planning in Addis Ababa while offering a
transferable framework for other African cities.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-05 16:14:36</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Autonomous motion planning under unknown nonlinear dynamics presents
significant challenges. An agent needs to continuously explore the system
dynamics to acquire its properties, such as reachability, in order to guide
system navigation adaptively. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
planning-control framework designed to compute a feasible trajectory toward a
target. Our approach involves partitioning the state space and approximating
the system by a piecewise affine (PWA) system with constrained control inputs.
By abstracting the PWA system into a directed weighted graph, we incrementally
update the existence of its edges via affine system identification and reach
control theory, introducing a predictive reachability condition by exploiting
prior information of the unknown dynamics. Heuristic weights are assigned to
edges based on whether their existence is certain or remains indeterminate.
Consequently, we propose a framework that adaptively collects and analyzes data
during mission execution, continually updates the predictive graph, and
synthesizes a controller online based on the graph search outcomes. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulation scenarios involving
a mobile robot operating in unknown terrains, with its unknown dynamics
abstracted as a single integrator model.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In many industrial robotics applications, multiple robots are working in a
shared workspace to complete a set of tasks as quickly as possible. Such
settings can be treated as multi-modal multi-robot multi-goal path planning
problems, where each robot has to reach an ordered sequence of goals. Existing
approaches to this type of problem solve this using prioritization or assume
synchronous completion of tasks, and are thus neither optimal nor complete. We
formalize this problem as a single path planning problem and introduce a
benchmark encompassing a diverse range of problem instances including scenarios
with various robots, planning horizons, and collaborative tasks such as
handovers. Along with the benchmark, we adapt an RRT* and a PRM* planner to
serve as a baseline for the planning problems. Both planners work in the
composite space of all robots and introduce the required changes to work in our
setting. Unlike existing approaches, our planner and formulation is not
restricted to discretized 2D workspaces, supports a changing environment, and
works for heterogeneous robot teams over multiple modes with different
constraints, and multiple goals. Videos and code for the benchmark and the

in the field. Robotic manipulation faces critical bottlenecks, including
significant challenges in insufficient data and inefficient data acquisition,
long-horizon and complex task planning, and the multi-modality reasoning
ability for robust policy learning performance across diverse environments. To
tackle these challenges, this survey introduces several generative model
paradigms, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs), diffusion models, probabilistic flow models, and
autoregressive models, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The
applications of these models are categorized into three hierarchical layers:
the Foundation Layer, focusing on data generation and reward generation; the
Intermediate Layer, covering language, code, visual, and state generation; and
the Policy Layer, emphasizing grasp generation and trajectory generation. Each
layer is explored in detail, along with notable works that have advanced the
state of the art. Finally, the survey outlines future research directions and

<p class='card-text'>Hemodynamic parameters such as pressure and wall shear stress play an
important role in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning in
cardiovascular diseases. These parameters can be accurately computed using
computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but CFD is computationally intensive.
Hence, deep learning methods have been adopted as a surrogate to rapidly
estimate CFD outcomes. A drawback of such data-driven models is the need for
time-consuming reference CFD simulations for training. In this work, we
introduce an active learning framework to reduce the number of CFD simulations
required for the training of surrogate models, lowering the barriers to their
deployment in new applications. We propose three distinct querying strategies
to determine for which unlabeled samples CFD simulations should be obtained.
These querying strategies are based on geometrical variance, ensemble
uncertainty, and adherence to the physics governing fluid dynamics. We
benchmark these methods on velocity field estimation in synthetic coronary
artery bifurcations and find that they allow for substantial reductions in
annotation cost. Notably, we find that our strategies reduce the number of
samples required by up to 50% and make the trained models more robust to
difficult cases. Our results show that active learning is a feasible strategy
to increase the potential of deep learning-based CFD surrogates.</p>

<p class='card-text'>For quadrotors, achieving safe and autonomous flight in complex environments
with wind disturbances and dynamic obstacles still faces significant
challenges. Most existing methods address wind disturbances in either
trajectory planning or control, which may lead to hazardous situations during
flight. The emergence of dynamic obstacles would further worsen the situation.
Therefore, we propose an efficient and reliable framework for quadrotors that
incorporates wind disturbance estimations during both the planning and control
phases via a generalized proportional integral observer. First, we develop a
real-time adaptive spatial-temporal trajectory planner that utilizes
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis for error dynamics resulting from
wind disturbances. By considering the forward reachability sets propagation on
an Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) map, safety is guaranteed.
Additionally, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) controller
considering wind disturbance compensation is implemented for robust trajectory
tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of our
framework. The video and supplementary material will be available at
