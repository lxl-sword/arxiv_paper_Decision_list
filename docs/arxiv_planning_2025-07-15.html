<p class='card-text'>Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,
their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and
active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent
perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action
dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such
as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment
interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and
long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset
of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic
environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.
The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,
object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a
multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level
instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express
the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to
evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key
dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage
Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below
20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current
limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of
EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning
followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial
improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's
effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p class='card-text'>World models (WMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in prediction, generation,
and planning tasks. Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data and
cannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in
the digital world. While multiple graph foundation models have been proposed,
they focus on graph learning tasks and cannot extend to diverse multi-modal
data and interdisciplinary tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the
Graph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and
graph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse
tasks as actions. The core of a GWM is a generic message-passing algorithm to
aggregate structured information, either over a unified multi-modal token space
by converting multi-modal data into text (GWM-T) or a unified multi-modal
embedding space by modality-specific encoders (GWM-E). Notably, GWM introduces
action nodes to support diverse tasks, where action nodes are linked to other
nodes via direct reference or similarity computation. Extensive experiments on
six tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching,
recommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation,
and planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches
domain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and
demonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks. Our
code for GWM is released at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GWM.</p>

<p class='card-text'>One in three women globally experiences intimate partner violence (IPV), yet
little is known about how such trauma affects economic decision-making. We
provide causal evidence that IPV influences women's time preferences - a key
parameter in models of savings, investment, and labor supply. We combine two
empirical strategies using four distinct datasets. First, in two randomized
recall experiments in Ethiopia, we randomly assigned women to recall specific
acts of abuse before eliciting their intertemporal choices. Women with IPV
experiences prompted to recall IPV display significantly greater impatience
than otherwise similar women who are not prompted. Second, we exploit exogenous
reductions in IPV generated by two randomized interventions - one involving
cash transfers, the other psychotherapy - and use treatment assignment as an
instrument for IPV exposure. Women who experience reduced IPV as a result of
treatment exhibit more patient time preferences. Together, these results
provide consistent, novel causal evidence that exposure to IPV induces
individuals to discount the future more heavily. This evidence suggests a
psychological channel through which violence can perpetuate economic
disadvantage and constrain women's ability to take actions - such as saving,
investing, or exiting abusive relationships - that require planning over time.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-14 13:56:59</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Optimization has been widely used to generate smooth trajectories for motion
planning. However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when
dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel
computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently
solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this
paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the
Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which
decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in
parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per
iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that
integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the
optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality
constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness.
Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving
over a tenfold speedup. To fully explore the potential of our algorithm on
modern parallel computing architectures, we deploy our framework on a GPU and
show high performance with thousands of segments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>TRIDENT is a planned multi-cubic-kilometer deep-sea neutrino telescope to be
built in the South China Sea, designed to rapidly discover high-energy
astrophysical neutrino sources with sensitivity to all neutrino flavors.
Achieving this at scale requires a detector design that balances performance
with power, cost, and mechanical simplicity. This study presents a
cost-effective optimization of TRIDENT's hybrid Digital Optical Module (hDOM)
design, comparing configurations using high-quantum-efficiency (QE) 3-inch PMTs
and larger 4-inch PMTs, the latter evaluated with both baseline and enhanced QE
assumptions. Using full-chain detector simulations incorporating site-specific
seawater optical properties and realistic backgrounds, we assess performance in
all-flavor neutrino detection efficiency, directional reconstruction, and tau
neutrino flavor identification from 1 TeV to 10 PeV. We find that if 4-inch
PMTs can achieve QE comparable to 3-inch PMTs, their performance matches or
improves upon that of the 3-inch design, while significantly reducing channel
count, power consumption, and cost. These findings support the 4-inch PMT hDOM
as a promising and scalable choice for TRIDENT's future instrumentation.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-14 12:18:01</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Inspection of complex underwater structures with tethered underwater vehicles
is often hindered by the risk of tether entanglement. We propose REACT
(real-time entanglement-aware coverage path planning for tethered underwater
vehicles), a framework designed to overcome this limitation. REACT comprises a
fast geometry-based tether model using the signed distance field (SDF) map for
accurate, real-time simulation of taut tether configurations around arbitrary
structures in 3D. This model enables an efficient online replanning strategy by
enforcing a maximum tether length constraint, thereby actively preventing
entanglement. By integrating REACT into a coverage path planning framework, we
achieve safe and optimal inspection paths, previously challenging due to tether
constraints. The complete REACT framework's efficacy is validated in a pipe
inspection scenario, demonstrating safe, entanglement-free navigation and
full-coverage inspection. Simulation results show that REACT achieves complete
coverage while maintaining tether constraints and completing the total mission
20% faster than conventional planners, despite a longer inspection time due to
proactive avoidance of entanglement that eliminates extensive post-mission
disentanglement. Real-world experiments confirm these benefits, where REACT
completes the full mission, while the baseline planner fails due to physical
tether entanglement.</p>

the architecture ensures recursive feasibility and stability through adjustable

<p class='card-text'>This research introduces MP-RBFN, a novel formulation leveraging Radial Basis
Function Networks for efficiently learning Motion Primitives derived from
optimal control problems for autonomous driving. While traditional motion
planning approaches based on optimization are highly accurate, they are often
computationally prohibitive. In contrast, sampling-based methods demonstrate
high performance but impose constraints on the geometric shape of trajectories.
MP-RBFN combines the strengths of both by coupling the high-fidelity trajectory
generation of sampling-based methods with an accurate description of vehicle
dynamics. Empirical results show compelling performance compared to previous
methods, achieving a precise description of motion primitives at low inference
times. MP-RBFN yields a seven times higher accuracy in generating optimized
motion primitives compared to existing semi-analytic approaches. We demonstrate
the practical applicability of MP-RBFN for motion planning by integrating the
method into a sampling-based trajectory planner. MP-RBFN is available as

<p class='card-text'>Brain tumor segmentation plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis and

this, we propose the Edge Iterative MRI Lesion Localization System
(EdgeIMLocSys), which integrates Continuous Learning from Human Feedback to
adaptively fine-tune segmentation models based on clinician feedback, thereby
enhancing robustness to scanner-specific imaging characteristics. Central to
this system is the Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Lightweight Network for
Brain Tumor Segmentation (GMLN-BTS), which employs a Modality-Aware Adaptive
Encoder (M2AE) to extract multi-scale semantic features efficiently, and a
Graph-based Multi-Modal Collaborative Interaction Module (G2MCIM) to model
complementary cross-modal relationships via graph structures. Additionally, we
introduce a novel Voxel Refinement UpSampling Module (VRUM) that
synergistically combines linear interpolation and multi-scale transposed
convolutions to suppress artifacts while preserving high-frequency details,
improving segmentation boundary accuracy. Our proposed GMLN-BTS model achieves
a Dice score of 85.1% on the BraTS2017 dataset with only 4.58 million

<p class='card-text'>Precise segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances
in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to
tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial

integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information,
facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level

capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the
spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms:
3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based

<p class='card-text'>This study presents a seasonally forced cholera model that incorporates
imperfect vaccination as a control strategy. The model captures the temporal
dynamics of susceptible, vaccinated, infected, and recovered individuals, as
well as the environmental pathogen concentration. A key focus is the
instantaneous reproduction number, which serves as a threshold indicator for
outbreak persistence or elimination. When reproduction number, the disease-free
equilibrium is attainable; otherwise, endemic conditions persist. We conduct a
sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of two critical parameters: the
vaccination rate and the waning rate of immunity. Results show that increasing
the vaccination rate and reducing the waning rate significantly decrease
reproduction number, reinforcing the importance of sustained vaccine efficacy.
Seasonal forcing amplifies the complexity of cholera dynamics, revealing the
need for timely public health interventions, especially before
high-transmission periods. This model demonstrates practical applicability in
informing vaccination strategies, especially in resource-limited settings prone
to seasonal outbreaks. It offers a flexible framework for public health
planning, adaptable to other waterborne diseases. The findings suggest that
integrated approaches combining vaccination, improved sanitation, and targeted
education are essential to reducing cholera transmission and achieving

<p class='card-text'>Navigation in dynamic environments requires autonomous systems to reason
about uncertainties in the behavior of other agents. In this paper, we
introduce a unified framework that combines trajectory planning with multimodal
predictions and active probing to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. We
develop a novel risk metric that seamlessly integrates multimodal prediction
uncertainties through mixture models. When these uncertainties follow a
Gaussian mixture distribution, we prove that our risk metric admits a
closed-form solution, and is always finite, thus ensuring analytical
tractability. To reduce prediction ambiguity, we incorporate an active probing
mechanism that strategically selects actions to improve its estimates of
behavioral parameters of other agents, while simultaneously handling multimodal
uncertainties. We extensively evaluate our framework in autonomous navigation
scenarios using the MetaDrive simulation environment. Results demonstrate that
our active probing approach successfully navigates complex traffic scenarios

  Review</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Boyou Chen, Kaihan Zhang, Austin Moore, Bochen Jia, Mengqiu Cao</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Public electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is crucial for
accelerating EV adoption and reducing transportation emissions; however,
disparities in infrastructure access have raised significant equity concerns.
This systematic review synthesizes existing knowledge and identifies gaps
regarding equity in EV public charging research. Following structured review
protocols, 91 peer-reviewed studies from Scopus and Google Scholar were
analyzed, focusing explicitly on equity considerations. The findings indicate
that current research on EV public charging equity mainly adopted geographic
information systems (GIS), network optimization, behavioral modeling, and
hybrid analytical frameworks, yet lacks consistent normative frameworks for
assessing equity outcomes. Equity assessments highlight four key dimensions:
spatial accessibility, cost burdens, reliability and usability, and user
awareness and trust. Socio-economic disparities, particularly income, housing
tenure, and ethnicity, frequently exacerbate inequitable access,
disproportionately disadvantaging low-income, renter, and minority populations.
Additionally, infrastructure-specific choices, including charger reliability,
strategic location, and pricing strategies, significantly influence adoption
patterns and equity outcomes. However, existing literature primarily reflects
North American, European, and Chinese contexts, revealing substantial
geographical and methodological limitations. This review suggests the need for
more robust normative evaluations of equity, comprehensive demographic data
integration, and advanced methodological frameworks, thereby guiding targeted,
inclusive, and context-sensitive infrastructure planning and policy
interventions.</p>

  Autonomous Racing for Iterative Optimal Performance</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>This paper presents a unified planning-control strategy for competing with
other racing cars called IteraOptiRacing in autonomous racing environments.
This unified strategy is proposed based on Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator
for Iterative Tasks (i2LQR), which can improve lap time performance in the
presence of surrounding racing obstacles. By iteratively using the ego car's
historical data, both obstacle avoidance for multiple moving cars and time cost
optimization are considered in this unified strategy, resulting in
collision-free and time-optimal generated trajectories. The algorithm's
constant low computation burden and suitability for parallel computing enable
real-time operation in competitive racing scenarios. To validate its
performance, simulations in a high-fidelity simulator are conducted with
multiple randomly generated dynamic agents on the track. Results show that the
proposed strategy outperforms existing methods across all randomly generated
autonomous racing scenarios, enabling enhanced maneuvering for the ego racing
car.</p>

<p class='card-text'>When planning transportation whose operation requires non-consumable
resources, the peak demand for allocated resources is often of higher interest
than the duration of resource usage. For instance, it is more cost-effective to
deliver parcels with a single truck over eight hours than to use two trucks for
four hours, as long as the time suffices. To model such scenarios, we introduce
the novel minimum peak cost flow over time problem, whose objective is to
minimise the maximum cost at all points in time rather than minimising the
integral of costs. We focus on minimising peak costs of temporally repeated
flows. These are desirable for practical applications due to their simple
structure. This yields the minimum-peak-cost Temporally Repeated flow problem
(MPC-TRF).
  We show that the simple structure of temporally repeated flows comes with the
drawback of arbitrarily bad approximation ratios compared to general flows over
time. Furthermore, our complexity analysis shows the integral version of
MPC-TRF is strongly NP-hard, even under strong restrictions. On the positive
side, we identify two benign special cases: unit-cost series-parallel networks
and networks with time horizon at least twice as long as the longest path in
the network (with respect to the transit time). In both cases, we show that
integral optimal flows if the desired flow value equals the maximum flow value
and fractional optimal flows for arbitrary flow values can be found in
polynomial time. For each of these cases, we provide an explicit algorithm that
constructs an optimal solution.</p>

  Questions Asked During Code Review</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Code review is a well-established and valued practice in the software
engineering community contributing to both code quality and interpersonal
benefits. However, there are challenges in both tools and processes that give
rise to misalignments and frustrations. Recent research seeks to address this
by automating code review entirely, but we believe that this risks losing the
majority of the interpersonal benefits such as knowledge transfer and shared
ownership.
  We believe that by better understanding the cognitive processes involved in
code review, it would be possible to improve tool support, with out without AI,
and make code review both more efficient, more enjoyable, while increasing or
maintaining all of its benefits. In this paper, we conduct an ethnographic
think-aloud study involving 10 participants and 34 code reviews. We build a
cognitive model of code review bottom up through thematic, statistical,
temporal, and sequential analysis of the transcribed material. Through the
data, the similarities between the cognitive process in code review and
decision-making processes, especially recognition-primed decision-making,
become apparent.
  The result is the Code Review as Decision-Making (CRDM) model that shows how
the developers move through two phases during the code review; first an
orientation phase to establish context and rationale and then an analytical
phase to understand, assess, and plan the rest of the review. Throughout the
process several decisions must be taken, on writing comments, finding more
information, voting, running the code locally, verifying continuous integration
results, etc.

<p class='card-text'>Predicting the future of surrounding agents and accordingly planning a safe,
goal-directed trajectory are crucial for automated vehicles. Current methods
typically rely on imitation learning to optimize metrics against the ground
truth, often overlooking how scene understanding could enable more holistic
trajectories. In this paper, we propose Plan-MAE, a unified pretraining
framework for prediction and planning that capitalizes on masked autoencoders.
Plan-MAE fuses critical contextual understanding via three dedicated tasks:
reconstructing masked road networks to learn spatial correlations, agent
trajectories to model social interactions, and navigation routes to capture
destination intents. To further align vehicle dynamics and safety constraints,
we incorporate a local sub-planning task predicting the ego-vehicle's near-term
trajectory segment conditioned on earlier segment. This pretrained model is
subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks to jointly generate the prediction
and planning trajectories. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that
Plan-MAE outperforms current methods on the planning metrics by a large margin
and can serve as an important pre-training step for learning-based motion
planner.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper introduces Consistency Trajectory Planning (CTP), a novel offline
model-based reinforcement learning method that leverages the recently proposed
Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM) for efficient trajectory optimization. While
prior work applying diffusion models to planning has demonstrated strong
performance, it often suffers from high computational costs due to iterative
sampling procedures. CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation
without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL
benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based
planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves
higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In
particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup
in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for
high-performance, low-latency offline planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The design of urban road networks significantly influences traffic
conditions, underscoring the importance of informed traffic planning. Traffic
planning experts rely on specialized platforms to simulate traffic systems,
assessing the efficacy of the road network across various states of
modifications. Nevertheless, a prevailing issue persists: many existing traffic
planning platforms exhibit inefficiencies in flexibly interacting with the road
network's structure and attributes and intuitively comparing multiple states
during the iterative planning process. This paper introduces TraSculptor, an
interactive planning decision-making system. To develop TraSculptor, we
identify and address two challenges: interactive modification of road networks
and intuitive comparison of multiple network states. For the first challenge,
we establish flexible interactions to enable experts to easily and directly
modify the road network on the map. For the second challenge, we design a
comparison view with a history tree of multiple states and a road-state matrix
to facilitate intuitive comparison of road network states. To evaluate
TraSculptor, we provided a usage scenario where the Braess's paradox was
showcased, invited experts to perform a case study on the Sioux Falls network,
and collected expert feedback through interviews.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate modeling and simulation of mobile networks are essential for
enabling intelligent and cost-effective network optimization. In this paper, we
propose MobiWorld, a generative world model designed to support high-fidelity
and flexible environment simulation for mobile network planning and
optimization. Unlike traditional predictive models constrained by limited
generalization capabilities, MobiWorld exhibits strong universality by
integrating heterogeneous data sources, including sensors, mobile devices, and
base stations, as well as multimodal data types such as sequences and images.
It is capable of generating both network element-level observations (e.g.,
traffic load, user distribution) and system-level performance indicators (e.g.,
throughput, energy consumption) to support a wide range of planning and
optimization tasks. Built upon advanced diffusion models, MobiWorld offers
powerful controllable generation capabilities by modeling the joint
distribution between mobile network data and diverse conditional factors
including spatio temporal contexts, user behaviors, and optimization policies.
This enables accurate simulation of dynamic network states under varying policy
configurations, providing optimization agents with precise environmental
feedback and facilitating effective decision-making without relying on costly
real-network interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MobiWorld in a
collaborative energy-saving scenario, where an agent uses observations and
rewards generated by MobiWorld to optimize base station sleep and user
offloading policies. Experimental results show that MobiWorld exhibits strong
controllable generation performance and outperforms traditional methods in
energy optimization.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Urban environments in hot-arid regions are increasingly challenged by rising
temperatures, rapid urban expansion, and reliance on energy intensive
mechanical cooling systems. This study presents a systematic review of peer
reviewed literature from 1980 to 2025 to assess both traditional and
contemporary passive cooling strategies tailored for arid urban settings.
Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, 30 high-quality studies were selected from
databases including Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar.
These works span diverse geographical contexts from the Middle East and North
Africa to parts of South Asia, and apply methods including field experiments,
computer-based simulations, and qualitative analyses. Findings highlight strong
consensus around passive principles such as solar control, natural ventilation,
and the use of thermal mass. Vernacular solutions like courtyards, wind towers,
and thick masonry walls remain effective, while innovations such as cool roofs,
phase change materials, and parametric optimization techniques expand the
design toolkit. Implementation is often limited by climate variability,
cultural shifts, regulations, and economic feasibility. The review concludes
that context-sensitive, hybrid solutions combining traditional knowledge with
modern technology hold the greatest potential for achieving sustainable thermal
comfort. These approaches must be supported by adaptive urban planning, user
centered design, and updated building codes. The study offers practical
insights for architects, planners, and policymakers aiming to create resilient,
low-carbon cities that harmonize cultural identity with environmental
responsibility.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous navigation in mobile robots, reliant on perception and planning,
faces major hurdles in large-scale, complex environments. These include heavy
computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and
traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of
perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random
Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight
linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space,
followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel
Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this
process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this
map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner)
framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance
Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to
refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a
closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP
model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive
navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form
gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in
diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in
time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe
navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster
community collaboration.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-12 14:46:42</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed
deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom
(PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The
PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding
the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high
adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely
aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening
and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively.
Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets,
2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2
scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in
path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path
length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM,
and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path
loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also
discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where
applicable.</p>
