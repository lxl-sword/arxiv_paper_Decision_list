<p class='card-text'>India is a founder-member country to participate in the construction of the
international multipurpose accelerator facility called the Facility for
Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at Darmstadt, Germany. Bose Institute,
Kolkata, has been designated as the Indian shareholder of the FAIR GmbH and the
nodal Indian Institution for co-ordinating Indian participation in the FAIR
programme.
  Indian participation in FAIR is twofold. Firstly, the advancement of
knowledge in nuclear astrophysics and reaction, high-energy nuclear physics,
atomic \& plasma physics and application through the participation of Indian
researchers, engineers and students in various experiments planned at FAIR. In
addition to this, India is also contributing high-tech accelerator equipment as
in-kind contribution to FAIR.
  Our active involvement include the designing, manufacturing and supply of
in-kind accelerator items e.g. power converters, vacuum chamber, beam catchers,
IT diagnostic cables among them and coordinating the participation of Indian
scientists in the FAIR experiments including detector development, physics
simulation, experimental data analysis.
  Indian researchers have been participating in the two major experiments at
FAIR, i.e. Nuclear Structure, Astrophysics and Reactions (NUSTAR) and
Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) and in particular Bose Institute is involved
in the CBM experiment, to study and characterize the matter created in the
relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions at high net baryon density and
relatively moderate temperature.
  In this article a brief overview on the FAIR facility, the experiments at
FAIR and Indian participation are presented.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This article proposes a new path planning method for addressing multi-level
terrain situations. The proposed method includes innovations in three aspects:
1) the pre-processing of point cloud maps with a multi-level skip-list
structure and data-slimming algorithm for well-organized and simplified map
formalization and management, 2) the direct acquisition of local traversability
indexes through vehicle and point cloud interaction analysis, which saves work
in surface fitting, and 3) the assignment of traversability indexes on a
multi-level connectivity graph to generate a weighted traversability graph for
generally search-based path planning. The A* algorithm is modified to utilize
the traversability graph to generate a short and safe path. The effectiveness
and reliability of the proposed method are verified through indoor and outdoor
experiments conducted in various environments, including multi-floor buildings,
woodland, and rugged mountainous regions. The results demonstrate that the
proposed method can properly address 3D path planning problems for ground
vehicles in a wide range of situations.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This study examines the psychological impact of energy crises on households,
utilising the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) to measure the stress induced
by disruptions in electricity, gas, and fuel supply and pricing. Through a
multivariate analysis incorporating Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression,
Simultaneous-Quantile Regressions (SQR), Random Forest (RF) and Ordered Probit
models, the research identifies the key socio-demographic and environmental
factors influencing household stress. Our findings reveal that urban residency,
low-income households, older individuals, and those with low environmental
awareness are particularly vulnerable to stress during energy crises. Regional
disparities and attitudes towards nuclear and renewable energy also
significantly shape stress responses. The study emphasises the need for
psychologically-informed energy policy, advocating for the inclusion of stress
metrics in energy planning to enhance resilience and address the
multi-dimensional nature of energy insecurity. This research contributes a
novel, human-centric perspective to energy policy, urging policymakers to
integrate psychosocial resilience alongside traditional technical and economic
considerations in the design of energy interventions.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Suvarthi Sarkar, Sparsh Mittal, Shivam Garg, Aryabartta Sahu</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-30 11:32:55</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Cloud computing has become a pivotal platform for executing scientific
workflows due to its scalable and cost-effective infrastructure. Scientific
Cloud Service Providers (SCSPs) act as intermediaries that rent virtual
machines (VMs) from Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers to meet users'
workflow execution demands. The SCSP earns profit from the execution of
scientific workflows if it completes the execution of the workflow before the
specified deadline of the workflow. This paper addresses two key challenges
that impact the profitability of SCSPs: the cold start problem and the
efficient management of diverse VM pricing models, namely reserved, on-demand,
and spot instances.
  We propose a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates initial planning
based on historical data with real-time adaptations informed by actual workload
variations. In the initial phase, VMs are provisioned using reserved pricing
based on predicted workloads and spot instances. During execution, the system
dynamically adjusts by provisioning additional VMs through on-demand or spot
instances to accommodate unexpected bursts in task arrivals. Our framework also
incorporates a dependency-aware task scheduling strategy that accounts for cold
start delays and spot pricing volatility. Experimental results on real-world
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 20% improvement over cold-start-focused techniques and
15% over pricing-model-based VM provisioning strategies.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Precise manipulation tasks require accurate knowledge of payload inertial
parameters. Unfortunately, identifying these parameters for unknown payloads
while ensuring that the robotic system satisfies its input and state
constraints while avoiding collisions with the environment remains a
significant challenge. This paper presents an integrated framework that enables
robotic manipulators to safely and automatically identify payload parameters
while maintaining operational safety guarantees. The framework consists of two
synergistic components: an online trajectory planning and control framework
that generates provably-safe exciting trajectories for system identification
that can be tracked while respecting robot constraints and avoiding obstacles
and a robust system identification method that computes rigorous
overapproximative bounds on end-effector inertial parameters assuming bounded
sensor noise. Experimental validation on a robotic manipulator performing
challenging tasks with various unknown payloads demonstrates the framework's
effectiveness in establishing accurate parameter bounds while maintaining
safety throughout the identification process. The code is available at our

<p class='card-text'>Continuous Software Engineering (CSE) is widely adopted in the industry,
integrating practices such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
(CI/CD). Beyond technical aspects, CSE also encompasses business activities
like continuous planning, budgeting, and operational processes. Coordinating
these activities in large-scale product development involves multiple
stakeholders, increasing complexity. This study aims to address this complexity
by identifying and analyzing critical dependencies in large-scale CSE. Based on
17 semi-structured interviews conducted at two Nordic fintech companies, our
preliminary findings indicate that dependencies between software teams and
support functions, as well as between software teams and external entities, are
the primary sources of delays and bottlenecks. As a next step, we plan to
further refine our understanding of critical dependencies in large-scale CSE

<p class='card-text'>Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is marked by significant inter-individual
variability in its progression, complicating accurate prognosis and
personalized care planning. This heterogeneity underscores the critical need
for predictive models capable of forecasting patient-specific disease
trajectories. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers powerful tools to address
this challenge by analyzing complex, multi-modal, and longitudinal patient
data. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AI methodologies applied to
personalized AD progression prediction. We review key approaches including
state-space models for capturing temporal dynamics, deep learning techniques
like Recurrent Neural Networks for sequence modeling, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) for leveraging network structures, and the emerging concept of AI-driven
digital twins for individualized simulation. Recognizing that data limitations
often impede progress, we examine common challenges such as high

AI-driven mitigation strategies, with a specific focus on synthetic data
generation using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial

strengths and limitations of current approaches, emphasizing the trend towards
multimodal integration and the persistent need for model interpretability and
generalizability. Finally, we identify critical open challenges, including
robust external validation, clinical integration, and ethical considerations,

<p class='card-text'>While most heuristics studied in heuristic search depend only on the state,
some accumulate information during search and thus also depend on the search
history. Various existing approaches use such dynamic heuristics in
$\mathrm{A}^*$-like algorithms and appeal to classic results for $\mathrm{A}^*$
to show optimality. However, doing so ignores the complexities of searching
with a mutable heuristic. In this paper we formalize the idea of dynamic
heuristics and use them in a generic algorithm framework. We study a particular
instantiation that models $\mathrm{A}^*$ with dynamic heuristics and show
general optimality results. Finally we show how existing approaches from
classical planning can be viewed as special cases of this instantiation, making
it possible to directly apply our optimality results.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Efficient mission planning for cooperative systems involving Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) requires addressing energy
constraints, scalability, and coordination challenges between agents. UAVs
excel in rapidly covering large areas but are constrained by limited battery
life, while UGVs, with their extended operational range and capability to serve
as mobile recharging stations, are hindered by slower speeds. This
heterogeneity makes coordination between UAVs and UGVs critical for achieving
optimal mission outcomes. In this work, we propose a scalable deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to address the energy-constrained
cooperative routing problem for multi-agent UAV-UGV teams, aiming to visit a
set of task points in minimal time with UAVs relying on UGVs for recharging
during the mission. The framework incorporates sortie-wise agent switching to
efficiently manage multiple agents, by allocating task points and coordinating
actions. Using an encoder-decoder transformer architecture, it optimizes routes
and recharging rendezvous for the UAV-UGV team in the task scenario. Extensive
computational experiments demonstrate the framework's superior performance over
heuristic methods and a DRL baseline, delivering significant improvements in
solution quality and runtime efficiency across diverse scenarios.
Generalization studies validate its robustness, while dynamic scenario
highlights its adaptability to real-time changes with a case study. This work
advances UAV-UGV cooperative routing by providing a scalable, efficient, and
robust solution for multi-agent mission planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We study a variant of LTLf synthesis that synthesizes adaptive strategies for
achieving a multi-tier goal, consisting of multiple increasingly challenging
LTLf objectives in nondeterministic planning domains. Adaptive strategies are
strategies that at any point of their execution (i) enforce the satisfaction of
as many objectives as possible in the multi-tier goal, and (ii) exploit
possible cooperation from the environment to satisfy as many as possible of the
remaining ones. This happens dynamically: if the environment cooperates (ii)
and an objective becomes enforceable (i), then our strategies will enforce it.
We provide a game-theoretic technique to compute adaptive strategies that is
sound and complete. Notably, our technique is polynomial, in fact quadratic, in
the number of objectives. In other words, it handles multi-tier goals with only
a minor overhead compared to standard LTLf synthesis.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Mechanical search (MS) in cluttered environments remains a significant
challenge for autonomous manipulators, requiring long-horizon planning and
robust state estimation under occlusions and partial observability. In this
work, we introduce XPG-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that enables
agents to efficiently perform MS tasks through explainable, priority-guided
decision-making based on raw sensory inputs. XPG-RL integrates a task-driven
action prioritization mechanism with a learned context-aware switching strategy
that dynamically selects from a discrete set of action primitives such as
target grasping, occlusion removal, and viewpoint adjustment. Within this
strategy, a policy is optimized to output adaptive threshold values that govern
the discrete selection among action primitives. The perception module fuses
RGB-D inputs with semantic and geometric features to produce a structured scene
representation for downstream decision-making. Extensive experiments in both
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that XPG-RL consistently
outperforms baseline methods in task success rates and motion efficiency,
achieving up to 4.5$\times$ higher efficiency in long-horizon tasks. These

Atlanta, news media outlets, the Atlanta Police Foundation, and individuals. We
gather and examine 32 publicly available maps collected through the Google

critical cartography, we conduct a content analysis of these maps to identify
the mapping technologies and techniques (data, cartographic elements, styles)

<p class='card-text'>As urban transit systems transition towards electrification, using renewable
energy sources (RES), such as solar, is essential to make them efficient and
sustainable. However, the intermittent nature of renewables poses a challenge
in deciding the solar panel requirements and battery energy storage system
(BESS) capacity at charging locations. To address these challenges, we propose
a two-stage stochastic programming model that considers seasonality in solar
energy generation while incorporating temperature-based variations in bus
energy consumption and dynamic time-of-use electricity prices. Specifically, we
formulate the problem as a multi-scenario linear program (LP) where the
first-stage long-term variables determine the charging station power capacity,
BESS capacity, and the solar panel area at each charging location. The
second-stage scenario-specific variables prescribe the energy transferred to
buses directly from the grid or the BESS during layovers. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this framework using data from Durham Transit Network
(Ontario) and Action Buses (Canberra), where bus schedules and charging
locations are determined using a concurrent scheduler-based heuristic. Solar
energy data is collected from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
database. We solved the multi-scenario LP using Benders' decomposition, which

scenarios was high. With solar energy production at the depots, our model
estimated a cost savings of 16.48% and 32.00% for the Durham and Canberra

  for Adaptive User Interfaces</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Daniel Gaspar-Figueiredo, Marta Fernández-Diego, Silvia Abrahão, Emilio Insfran</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Adaptive User Interfaces (AUI) play a crucial role in modern software
applications by dynamically adjusting interface elements to accommodate users'
diverse and evolving needs. However, existing adaptation strategies often lack
real-time responsiveness. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising approach for addressing complex, sequential adaptation challenges,
enabling adaptive systems to learn optimal policies based on previous
adaptation experiences. Although RL has been applied to AUIs,integrating RL
agents effectively within user interactions remains a challenge.
  In this paper, we enhance a RL-based Adaptive User Interface adaption
framework by incorporating personalized human feedback directly into the
leaning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a single pre-trained RL
model, our approach trains a unique RL agent for each user, allowing
individuals to actively shape their personal RL agent's policy, potentially
leading to more personalized and responsive UI adaptations. To evaluate this
approach, we conducted an empirical study to assess the impact of integrating
human feedback into the RL-based Adaptive User Interface adaption framework and
its effect on User Experience (UX). The study involved 33 participants
interacting with AUIs incorporating human feedback and non-adaptive user
interfaces in two domains: an e-learning platform and a trip-planning
application. The results suggest that incorporating human feedback into
RL-driven adaptations significantly enhances UX, offering promising directions
for advancing adaptive capabilities and user-centered design in AUIs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Robotic-assisted procedures offer enhanced precision, but while fully
autonomous systems are limited in task knowledge, difficulties in modeling
unstructured environments, and generalisation abilities, fully manual
teleoperated systems also face challenges such as delay, stability, and reduced
sensory information. To address these, we developed an interactive control
strategy that assists the human operator by predicting their motion plan at
both high and low levels. At the high level, a surgeme recognition system is
employed through a Transformer-based real-time gesture classification model to
dynamically adapt to the operator's actions, while at the low level, a
Confidence-based Intention Assimilation Controller adjusts robot actions based
on user intent and shared control paradigms. The system is built around a
robotic suturing task, supported by sensors that capture the kinematics of the
robot and task dynamics. Experiments across users with varying skill levels
demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing statistically
significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared
to traditional teleoperation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Proton Computed Tomography (pCT) provides a promising solution to enhance the
accuracy of Relative Stopping Power (RSP) required for proton therapy planning.
This research introduces a novel high-granularity pCT architecture that
incorporates a silicon pixel tracking system and a calorimetric range
telescope, which uniquely integrates range telescope functionality with track
discrimination capabilities. The Bortfeld function fitting and Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) classifier algorithms are developed and applied for
discrimination. In simulation studies, both approaches demonstrate the
capability to reduce uncertainty in Water Equivalent Path Length (WEPL)
determination for individual proton tracks to below 3~mm. The standard imaging
protocol (3.2~mGy, $4\times10^{8}$ protons) achieves sub-millimeter spatial
resolution ($\sim$0.5 mm) with sub-1\% RSP accuracy. With proton count
requirements reduced by track discrimination, an ultra-low-dose protocol
(0.16~mGy, $2\times10^{7}$~protons) is proposed with achieved sub-1\% RSP
accuracy and $\sim$1.1~mm spatial resolution in simulation. This low-dose
performance significantly expands clinical applicability, particularly for
pediatric imaging or frequent imaging scenarios. Furthermore, the target 10 MHz
proton detection rate suggests potential for real-time image guidance during
radiotherapy. By circumventing the need for ultra-precise energy measurements,
this design minimizes hardware complexity and provides a scalable foundation
for future pCT systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In this paper, a novel quantum classical hybrid framework is proposed that
synergizes quantum with Classical Reinforcement Learning. By leveraging the
inherent parallelism of quantum computing, the proposed approach generates
robust Q tables and specialized turn cost estimations, which are then
integrated with a classical Reinforcement Learning pipeline. The Classical
Quantum fusion results in rapid convergence of training, reducing the training
time significantly and improved adaptability in scenarios featuring static,
dynamic, and moving obstacles. Simulator based evaluations demonstrate
significant enhancements in path efficiency, trajectory smoothness, and mission
success rates, underscoring the potential of framework for real time,
autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments. Furthermore,
the proposed framework was tested beyond simulations on practical scenarios,

<p class='card-text'>Making sense of the world and acting in it relies on building simplified
mental representations that abstract away aspects of reality. This principle of
cognitive mapping is universal to agents with limited resources. Living
organisms, people, and algorithms all face the problem of forming functional
representations of their world under various computing constraints. In this
work, we explore the hypothesis that human resource-efficient planning may
arise from representing the world as predictably structured. Building on the
metaphor of concepts as programs, we propose that cognitive maps can take the
form of generative programs that exploit predictability and redundancy, in
contrast to directly encoding spatial layouts. We use a behavioral experiment
to show that people who navigate in structured spaces rely on modular planning
strategies that align with programmatic map representations. We describe a
computational model that predicts human behavior in a variety of structured
scenarios. This model infers a small distribution over possible programmatic
cognitive maps conditioned on human prior knowledge of the world, and uses this
distribution to generate resource-efficient plans. Our models leverages a Large
Language Model as an embedding of human priors, implicitly learned through
training on a vast corpus of human data. Our model demonstrates improved
computational efficiency, requires drastically less memory, and outperforms
unstructured planning algorithms with cognitive constraints at predicting human
behavior, suggesting that human planning strategies rely on programmatic
cognitive maps.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Urban Building Energy Models (UBEM) are vital for enhancing energy efficiency
and sustainability in urban planning. However, data scarcity often challenges
their validation, particularly the lack of hourly measured data and the variety
of building samples. This study addresses this issue by applying bias
adjustment techniques from survey research to improve UBEM validation
robustness with incomplete measured data. Error estimation tests are conducted
using various levels of missingness, and three bias adjustment methods are
employed: multivariate imputation, cell weighting and raking weighting. Key
findings indicate that using incomplete data in UBEM validation without
adjustment is not advisable, while bias adjustment techniques significantly
enhance the robustness of validation, providing more reliable model validity
estimates. Cell weighting is preferable in this study due to its reliance on
joint distributions of auxiliary variables.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In recent years, the field of robotics has witnessed a significant shift from
operating in structured environments to handling dynamic and unpredictable
settings. To tackle these challenges, methodologies from the field of
self-adaptive systems enabling these systems to react to unforeseen
circumstances during runtime have been applied. The Monitoring-Analysis-
Planning-Execution over Knowledge (MAPE-K) feedback loop model is a popular
approach, often implemented in a managing subsystem, responsible for monitoring
and adapting a managed subsystem. This work explores the implementation of the
MAPE- K feedback loop based on Behavior Trees (BTs) within the Robot Operating
System 2 (ROS2) framework. By delineating the managed and managing subsystems,
our approach enhances the flexibility and adaptability of ROS-based systems,
ensuring they not only meet Quality-of-Service (QoS), but also system health
metric requirements, namely availability of ROS nodes and communication
channels. Our implementation allows for the application of the method to new
managed subsystems without needing custom BT nodes as the desired behavior can
be configured within a specific rule set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through various experiments on a system showcasing an aerial

<p class='card-text'>This thesis presents a unified control framework for agile and fault-tolerant
flight of the Multi-Modal Mobility Morphobot (M4) in aerial mode. The M4 robot
is capable of transitioning between ground and aerial locomotion. The
articulated legs enable more dynamic maneuvers than a standard quadrotor

simultaneously plan posture manipulation and thrust vectoring actions, allowing
the robot to execute sharp turns and dynamic flight trajectories. The framework
integrates an agile and fault-tolerant control logic that enables precise
tracking under aggressive maneuvers while compensating for actuator failures,
ensuring continued operation without significant performance degradation.
Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method,

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-29 00:10:14</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in planning have explored using learning methods to help
planning. However, little attention has been given to adapting search
algorithms to work better with learning systems. In this paper, we introduce
partial-space search, a new search space for classical planning that leverages
the relational structure of actions given by PDDL action schemas -- a structure
overlooked by traditional planning approaches. Partial-space search provides a
more granular view of the search space and allows earlier pruning of poor
actions compared to state-space search. To guide partial-space search, we
introduce action set heuristics that evaluate sets of actions in a state. We
describe how to automatically convert existing heuristics into action set
heuristics. We also train action set heuristics from scratch using large
training datasets from partial-space search. Our new planner, LazyLifted,
exploits our better integrated search and learning heuristics and outperforms
the state-of-the-art ML-based heuristic on IPC 2023 learning track (LT)
benchmarks. We also show the efficiency of LazyLifted on high-branching factor
tasks and show that it surpasses LAMA in the combined IPC 2023 LT and
high-branching factor benchmarks.</p>

  Radiotherapy</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Jiayue Han, Ya-Nan Zhu, Aoxiang Wang, Wangyao Li, Yuting Lin, Hao Gao</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-28 19:50:51</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Background: Ultra-high-dose-rate (UHDR) radiation therapy has demonstrated
promising potential in reducing toxicity to organs-at-risk (OARs). Proton
therapy is uniquely positioned to deliver UHDR by leveraging the Bragg peak in
conjunction with patient-specific range modulators (PSRMs) to generate a
spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP). Existing proton FLASH (pFLASH) planning typically
involves (1) generating a multi-energy IMPT plan for spot weights and (2)
converting it to single-energy delivery via PSRM optimization. However, the
intrinsic coupling between spot weight distribution and PSRM design has not
been fully investigated. Purpose: This work proposes Joint Range-Modulator and
Spot Optimization (JRSO) that simultaneously optimizes the PSRM and spot
weights to improve the plan quality of conformal pFLASH therapy. Methods:
Unlike the conventional method, JRSO does not require a one-to-one
correspondence between beam spots and PSRM pins. To achieve better plan
quality, starting from an initial solution derived from a conventional IMPT
plan, JRSO alternatively updates the PSRM design and spot weights. This process
progressively refines both parameters while ensuring compliance with practical
delivery constraints, such as the minimum monitor-unit (MMU) requirement.
Results: JRSO obtained improved plan quality compared to the conventional
method. For example, in a head-and-neck (HN) case, JRSO lowered the maximum
target dose from 117.6% to 107.1%, improved the conformity index from 0.74 to
0.87, and decreased the region-of-interest (ROI) effective dose from 6.50 Gy to
6.10 Gy. Conclusion: A new optimization method JRSO is proposed for conformal
pFLASH radiotherapy. It outperforms the conventional approach and may extend
the applicability of PSRM to more complex clinical scenarios, particularly
those involving misalignments between beam spots and pins.</p>
