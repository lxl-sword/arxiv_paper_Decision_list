<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Priyam Srivastava, Vivek Kumar, Gurudev Dutt, Kaushik P. Seshadreesan</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-29 17:48:14</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We study the variational optimization of entangled probe states for quantum
sensing tasks involving the estimation of a structured linear function of local
phase parameters. Specifically, we consider scenarios where each qubit in a
spin-1/2 array accumulates a phase phi_i = alpha_i * theta, with a known weight
vector alpha, reducing the task to single-parameter estimation of theta. Using
parameterized quantum circuits composed of dipolar-interacting gates and global
rotations, we optimize probe states with respect to the Classical Fisher
Information (CFI) using a gradient-free evolutionary strategy. We benchmark the
optimized circuits for two relevant cases: (i) uniform encoding, where all
qubits contribute equally to the phase function, and (ii) a custom encoding
where a central qubit dominates the weight vector. In both cases, the optimized
probe states approach the respective entanglement-enhanced (EE) limits dictated
by the encoding structure. Our results demonstrate the power of variational
approaches for tailoring metrologically useful entanglement to specific
estimation tasks in quantum sensor networks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-29 15:51:19</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We present a quantum algorithm for solving perfect mazes by casting the
pathfinding task as a structured search problem. Building on Grover's amplitude
amplification, the algorithm encodes all candidate paths in superposition and
evaluates their proximity to the goal using a reversible fitness operator based
on quantum arithmetic. A Grover-compatible oracle marks high-fitness states,
and an adaptive cutoff strategy refines the search iteratively. We provide
formal definitions, unitary constructions, and convergence guarantees, along
with a resource analysis showing efficient scaling with maze size and path
length. The framework serves as a foundation for quantum-hybrid pathfinding and
planning. The full algorithmic pipeline is specified from encoding to
amplification, including oracle design and fitness evaluation. The approach is
readily extensible to other search domains, including navigation over tree-like

<p class='card-text'>Airborne mobile Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) base stations
have garnered significant attention recently, with ISAC technology being a
crucial application for 6G networks. Since ISAC can sense potential mobile
communication users, this paper studies an effective scheme for a multi-UAV
network tailored for emergency communication. In this paper, we develop a
temporal-assisted frame structure utilizing integrated omnidirectional and
directional beampattern to facilitate efficient and frequent searching, with
extended Kalman filtering (EKF) as an aid to beam alignment. Further, we
address an optimization problem to maximize the total achievable rate per slot
by jointly designing UAV beamforming, load management, and UAV direction
planning, all while adhering to the constraints of the predicted beam coverage.
Given the problem NP-hard, we introduce three robust mechanisms for its
resolution: an enhanced distributed Successive Convex Approximation
(SCA)-Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM) algorithm, an coalition game approach,
and a Fermat point search method. In particular, the proposed SCA-IRM algorithm
decomposes the original complex optimization problem into several sub-problems
and assigns them equally to each UAV, so as to realize distributed computing
and improve computational efficiency. Our proposed simulations demonstrate the
improved system performance in terms of communication rate, fairness, and
sensing accuracy, providing design guidelines of UAV-assisted emergency

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-29 14:43:25</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications

<p class='card-text'>In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding

recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce

propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-29 13:57:23</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Stellar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can strip planetary
atmospheres, reducing the potential habitability of terrestrial planets. While
flares have been observed for decades, stellar CMEs remain elusive. Extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) emissions are sensitive to both flares and CME-induced
coronal dimming. We assess the detectability of stellar CME-induced EUV dimming
events by adapting a known "Sun-as-a-star" dimming technique -- validated by
the Solar Dynamics Observatory's EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) -- to stellar
conditions. We adapt the solar data to reflect a range of stellar intensities,
accounting for intrinsic brightness, distance, and interstellar medium (ISM)
attenuation. We generate synthetic light curves for two different missions: the
legacy EUV Explorer (EUVE) and the proposed ESCAPE mission. Our results
indicate that dimming detections are well within reach. EUVE's broadband imager
was capable of detecting stellar CMEs -- albeit with limited spectral
(temperature) resolution -- but that was not part of the observing plan. EUVE's
spectroscopic survey lacked sufficient sensitivity for CME detections.
Optimizing modern instrument design for this task would make the observation
fully feasible. In this work, we present a tool to explore the stellar-CME
detection parameter space. Our tool shows that an instrument with performance
similar to ESCAPE, setting a 600-second integration period, and integrating the
spectra into bands, any star with an X-ray flux $\geq 2.51 \times
10^{-12}$ergs$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$ should have a $\geq 3\sigma$ detection even for
a modest few-percent dimming profile, regardless of ISM attenuation. Such
measurements would be crucial for understanding the space weather environments
of exoplanet host stars and, ultimately, for evaluating planetary habitability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery
due to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional
template-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability
and limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk
generating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative
framework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation,
enabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We
evaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks,
demonstrating its superiority over both template classification and
SMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe
achieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct
multi-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient
alternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These

<p class='card-text'>Especially in regions with high solar irradiation, photocatalysis presents a
promising low-cost "green" hydrogen production option. Thus, this paper
analyzes impacts of increasing photocatalysis shares on the European energy
system using an open-source energy system optimization model covering the
electricity, industry, and heating sectors with high spatial and temporal
resolution. Photocatalysis deployment is investigated at various market shares
by exogenously altering photocatalysis costs. The results show that integrating
photocatalysis necessitates systematic adjustments since it lacks the flexible
load attributes of water electrolysis. Therefore, a significant geographic
shift in hydrogen production and demand from the Northwest to South Europe is
expected in the case of large-scale photocatalysis adoption. Despite these
challenges, installed photocatalysis shows costs within the photocatalysis cost
projections. Thus, photocatalysis could contribute to a critical
diversification of hydrogen production, easing material demands for other

  Techniques in Idealized Left Ventricle Models</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-29 10:08:30</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Understanding the formation, propagation, and breakdown of the main vortex
ring (VR) is essential for characterizing left ventricular (LV) hemodynamics,
as its dynamics have been linked to the onset and progression of cardiovascular
diseases. In this study, two idealized LV geometries, a semi-ellipsoidal
chamber and a more rounded configuration, are analyzed using computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations under physiological conditions, with the aim
of investigating the fluid mechanisms that govern VR evolution during diastole.
Modal decomposition techniques, specifically proper orthogonal decomposition
(POD) and higher order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD), are employed to
identify dominant coherent structures and track their temporal behavior.
  To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time such an analysis is
conducted with the explicit goal of unraveling the physics of vortex ring
dynamics in idealized ventricular chambers. The comparative approach reveals
that geometric morphology plays a central role in modulating the flow: in one
case, early interaction between the VR and the ventricular wall, driven by the
chamber's shape, triggers strong nonlinear interactions and a more intricate
dynamic evolution. In the other, the vortex ring propagates more freely toward
the apex before dissipating, resulting in a more organized flow pattern and
simpler spectral content.
  These findings advance the understanding of flow-based indicators relevant to
early diagnosis and treatment planning in cardiovascular disease. Moreover,
they illustrate how the choice of ventricular geometry can influence not only
the simulated hemodynamics, but also the effectiveness of data-driven analysis
tools, depending on the clinical context under study.</p>

multistage stochastic program with stage-wise independent uncertainty. The
algorithm first decomposes the full problem into a reduced master problem and
subproblems using Adaptive Benders decomposition. The subproblems are then
solved by an enhanced SDDP. The enhancement includes (1) valid bounds at each
iteration, (2) a path exploration rule, (3) cut sharing among subproblems, and
(4) guaranteed {\delta}-optimal convergence. The cuts for the subproblems are
then shared by calling adaptive oracles. The key contribution of the paper is
the first algorithm for solving this class of problems. The algorithm is
demonstrated on a power system investment planning problem with multi-timescale

<p class='card-text'>The long-standing claim of dark matter detection by the DAMA experiment
remains a crucial open question in astroparticle physics. A key step towards
its independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with
improved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments
rely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors,
which present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic
radioactivity and a high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D
project developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is
read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon
detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark
noise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at
cryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed
cryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the
detector and the read-out electronics down to about 80K. We report the first
experimental characterization of 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large
area (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix. The photoelectron yield obtained with a
preliminary configuration is 7.2 photoelectrons/keV, which is rather promising,
also in light of several planned developments. The signal-to-noise ratio and
the energy threshold attainable with SiPMs is expected to improve the
sensitivity for dark matter searches beyond the reach of current-generation
PMT-based detectors. This result is the first proof of the viability of this
technology and sets a milestone toward the design of future large-scale

<p class='card-text'>In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering

enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of

multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical

VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-29 07:22:09</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Modeling and evaluation of automated vehicles (AVs) in mixed-autonomy traffic
is essential prior to their safe and efficient deployment. This is especially
important at urban junctions where complex multi-agent interactions occur.
Current approaches for modeling vehicular maneuvers and interactions at urban
junctions have limitations in formulating non-cooperative interactions and
vehicle dynamics within a unified mathematical framework. Previous studies
either assume predefined paths or rely on cooperation and central
controllability, limiting their realism and applicability in mixed-autonomy
traffic. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a modeling
framework for trajectory planning and decentralized vehicular control at urban
junctions. The framework employs a bi-level structure where the upper level
generates kinematically feasible reference trajectories using an efficient
graph search algorithm with a custom heuristic function, while the lower level
employs a predictive controller for trajectory tracking and optimization.
Unlike existing approaches, our framework does not require central
controllability or knowledge sharing among vehicles. The vehicle kinematics are
explicitly incorporated at both levels, and acceleration and steering angle are
used as control variables. This intuitive formulation facilitates analysis of
traffic efficiency, environmental impacts, and motion comfort. The framework's
decentralized structure accommodates operational and stochastic elements, such
as vehicles' detection range, perception uncertainties, and reaction delay,
making the model suitable for safety analysis. Numerical and simulation
experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate the framework's capability in
modeling accurate and realistic vehicular maneuvers and interactions at various
urban junctions, including unsignalized intersections and roundabouts.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Human demonstration data is often ambiguous and incomplete, motivating
imitation learning approaches that also exhibit reliable planning behavior. A
common paradigm to perform planning-from-demonstration involves learning a
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) then deploying this
reward via Model Predictive Control (MPC). Towards unifying these methods, we
derive a replacement of the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent. With
connections to Adversarial Imitation Learning, this formulation enables
end-to-end interactive learning of planners from observation-only
demonstrations. In addition to benefits in interpretability, complexity, and
safety, we study and observe significant improvements on sample efficiency,
out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness. The study includes
evaluations in both simulated control benchmarks and real-world navigation
experiments using few-to-single observation-only demonstrations.</p>

  Safety-Efficiency Trade-Offs</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Chang-Hun Ji, SiWoon Song, Youn-Hee Han, SungTae Moon</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-29 05:03:57</h6>
<p class='card-text'>A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the
safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in
unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer
computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert
knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even
with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired
trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are
adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the
safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single
parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically
adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively
measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require
expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both
structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results
demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency
trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner
outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating
safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when
tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability
and practicality of our proposed planner.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-29 04:16:21</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This full research paper investigates the impact of generative AI (GenAI) on
the learner experience, with a focus on how learners engage with and utilize
the information it provides. In e-learning environments, learners often need to
navigate a complex information space on their own. This challenge is further
compounded in interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics, due to the varied
prior knowledge and backgrounds. In this paper, we studied how GenAI influences
information search in bioinformatics research: (1) How do interactions with a
GenAI chatbot influence learner orienteering behaviors?; and (2) How do
learners identify information scent in GenAI chatbot responses? We adopted an
autoethnographic approach to investigate these questions. GenAI was found to
support orienteering once a learning plan was established, but it was
counterproductive prior to that. Moreover, traditionally value-rich information
sources such as bullet points and related terms proved less effective when
applied to GenAI responses. Information scents were primarily recognized
through the presence or absence of prior knowledge of the domain. These
findings suggest that GenAI should be adopted into e-learning environments with
caution, particularly in interdisciplinary learning contexts.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Purpose: This study explores the feasibility of dose-escalated proton beam
therapy (dPBT) for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC) patients by
modeling common patient scenarios using current clinically-adopted practices.
Methods: Five patient datasets were used as simulation phantoms, each with six
tumour sizes, to systematically simulate treatment scenarios typical in LAPC
patients. Using the Raystation treatment planning system, robustly-optimised
dPBT and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) treatment plans were created
with a 5 mm margin allowing for intra- and inter-fraction anatomical changes.
following clinically-adopted protocols. Safe dose-escalation feasibility is
assessed with dose metrics, tumour control (TCP) and normal tissue complication
probabilities (NTCP) for average and worst-case intra-fraction motion
scenarios. Significance testing was performed using a paired student's t-test.
Results: Dose-escalation feasibility is largely dependent on tumour size and
proximity to critical structures. Minimal therapeutic benefit was observed for
patients with greater than 4.5 cm tumours, however for tumours less than or
equal to 4.5 cm dPBT TCPs of 45-90% compared to SABR TCPs of 10-40% (p<0.05).
The worst-case scenario dPBT TCP was comparable to SABR. Hypofractioned dPBT
further improved this result to greater than 90% (p<0.05) for tumours less than
or equal to 4.5 cm. Conclusion: Safe dPBT is feasible for patients with targets
up to the median size and see a significant therapeutic benefit compared to the
current standard of care in SABR. A patient-specific approach should be taken
based on tumour size and surrounding anatomy.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-29 01:28:21</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This work presents the first application of the state-of-the-art
Koenig-D'Amico reachable set theory solver to cislunar, chaotic relative motion
in the Circular-Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP). The relative motion
dynamics of two spacecraft, a chief and a deputy, in the CR3BP are formulated
as a Linear Time-Variant (LTV) system, allowing the solver to find an optimal
impulsive control maneuver plan. This methodology demonstrates robust and
accurate control performance for both small and large reconfigurations over
different CR3BP orbits and control windows. These capabilities are enhanced by
a Model Predictive Control (MPC) architecture to reject all sources of control,
navigation, and dynamic error. The performance of the proposed approach is
validated by unit testing, Monte Carlo simulations, and comparisons to baseline
models for spacecraft relative motion. Overall, this work demonstrates an
optimal control methodology with the computational efficiency to be used
on-board spacecraft, enabling the safe, effective, and efficient operation of
Distributed Space Systems in cislunar space.</p>

<p class='card-text'>As space exploration extends into cislunar space and further towards Mars,
understanding the relativistic effects on clocks on Mars, particularly in
relation to multibody gravitational influences, becomes increasingly important
for accurate clock synchronization. This study estimates clock rates on Mars
and compares them to those on the Moon and Earth. We find that, on average,
clocks on Mars tick faster than those on the Earth's geoid by 477 microseconds
per day, with a variation of 226 microseconds per day over a Martian year.
Additionally, there is an amplitude modulation of approximately 40 microseconds
per day over seven synodic cycles. We also introduce a formalism for addressing
the effects of solar tides on the Earth-Moon system for predicting clock rates
on the Moon and Mars more accurately when compared to using only Keplerian
orbit approximations. Our analysis quantifies the relativistic proper time
offsets among Martian, lunar, and terrestrial clocks, highlighting important
implications for mission planning and the implementation of timekeeping systems

  local measurements of the Galactic magnetic field</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-28 19:03:58</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Planned and ongoing campaigns for the acquisition of high-quality local
measurements of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) at interstellar cloud
locations have generated intense interest in the use of such measurements to
accurately backtrack Ultra High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) through the Milky
Way, a crucial aspect of charged-particle astronomy. However, the inherent
sparsity of these measurements raises concerns regarding the feasibility of
this approach. We assessed the achievable accuracy of UHECR backtracking using
mock sparse local GMF data derived from the Jansson & Farrar 2012 (JF12) GMF
model and mock UHECR events. We created mock UHECR datasets that trace back
within a 3 degree angular range from the galaxy M82 (a hypothesized UHECR
source), and we investigated the impact on such backtracking attempts of
varying GMF measurement sparsity and of varying GMF strength, which we emulated
by rescaling the strength of the ordered components of the JF12 model. We found
that: (a) for an average GMF strength of $1\mu G$, satisfactory backtracking
results for magnetic rigidities of $10^{20}$ eV can be obtained even with very
sparse measurements ($ \sim 1600$ pc); (b) when the average GMF strength is
significantly increased ($\sim$ factor of 10) the accuracy of backtracking
breaks down at measurement spacings of 400 pc. These findings emphasize on one
hand that sparsity is not an automatic deal-breaker for the utility of local
GMF measurements in UHECR backtracking. On the other hand, we also confirm that
important challenges remain on the path from sparse local GMF measurements to
precise charge-particle astronomy, especially in directions of high-strength
ordered magnetic fields. This underscores the importance of using all available
complementary magnetic field measurements and sophisticated reconstruction
techniques to enable accurate backtracking of UHECR.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in
traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning
methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application.
However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one
geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in
factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle
types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle)
leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a
novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images
and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our
key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge
transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to
mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments.
Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent
performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain
data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation
methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than
50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial
datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

<p class='card-text'>We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models
for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating
neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that
each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We
prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully
represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over
complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness.
This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and
embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our
framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination,
repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for
understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These
results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in
future development of language models.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Currently, large partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are
often solved by sampling-based online methods which interleave planning and
execution phases. However, a pre-computed offline policy is more desirable in
POMDP applications with time or energy constraints. But previous offline
algorithms are not able to scale up to large POMDPs. In this article, we
propose a new sampling-based algorithm, the partially observable Monte-Carlo
graph search (POMCGS) to solve large POMDPs offline. Different from many online
POMDP methods, which progressively develop a tree while performing
(Monte-Carlo) simulations, POMCGS folds this search tree on the fly to
construct a policy graph, so that computations can be drastically reduced, and
users can analyze and validate the policy prior to embedding and executing it.
Moreover, POMCGS, together with action progressive widening and observation
clustering methods provided in this article, is able to address certain
continuous POMDPs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that POMCGS can generate
policies on the most challenging POMDPs, which cannot be computed by previous
offline algorithms, and these policies' values are competitive compared with
the state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithms.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical
challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in
Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus
calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world
adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per
institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on
scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on
standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during
training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same
tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset
explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.
SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding
2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the
isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of
model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.
Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines
augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to
explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons
improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising
task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing
SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for
evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a
new standard for reliability testing.</p>
