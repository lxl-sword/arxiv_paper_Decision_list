<p class='card-text'>This study presents a methodology to safely manipulate branches to aid
various agricultural tasks. Humans in a real agricultural environment often
manipulate branches to perform agricultural tasks effectively, but current
agricultural robots lack this capability. This proposed strategy to manipulate
branches can aid in different precision agriculture tasks, such as fruit
picking in dense foliage, pollinating flowers under occlusion, and moving
overhanging vines and branches for navigation. The proposed method modifies
RRT* to plan a path that satisfies the branch geometric constraints and obeys
branch deformable characteristics. Re-planning is done to obtain a path that
helps the robot exert force within a desired range so that branches are not
damaged during manipulation. Experimentally, this method achieved a success
rate of 78\% across 50 trials, successfully moving a branch from different
starting points to a target region.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Given the substantial growth in the use of additive manufacturing in
construction (AMC), it is necessary to ensure the quality of printed specimens
which can be much more complex than conventionally manufactured parts. This
study explores the various aspects of geometry and surface quality control for
3D concrete printing (3DCP), with a particular emphasis on deposition-based
methods, namely extrusion and shotcrete 3D printing (SC3DP). A comprehensive
overview of existing quality control (QC) methods and strategies is provided
and preceded by an in-depth discussion. Four categories of data capture
technologies are investigated and their advantages and limitations in the
context of AMC are discussed. Additionally, the effects of environmental
conditions and objects' properties on data capture are also analyzed. The study
extends to automated data capture planning methods for different sensors.
Furthermore, various quality control strategies are explored across different
stages of the fabrication cycle of the printed object including: (i) During
printing, (ii) Layer-wise, (iii) Preassembly, and (iv) Assembly. In addition to
reviewing the methods already applied in AMC, we also address various research
gaps and future trends and highlight potential methodologies from adjacent
domains that could be transferred to AMC.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-10 15:10:40</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In recent years, there has been increased interest in the design, training,
and evaluation of end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) systems. One often
overlooked aspect is the uncertainty of planned trajectories predicted by these
systems, despite awareness of their own uncertainty being key to achieve safety
and robustness. We propose to estimate this uncertainty by adapting loss
prediction from the uncertainty quantification literature. To this end, we
introduce a novel light-weight module, dubbed CATPlan, that is trained to
decode motion and planning embeddings into estimates of the collision loss used
to partially supervise end-to-end AD systems. During inference, these estimates
are interpreted as collision risk. We evaluate CATPlan on the safety-critical,
nerf-based, closed-loop benchmark NeuroNCAP and find that it manages to detect
collisions with a $54.8\%$ relative improvement to average precision over a
GMM-based baseline in which the predicted trajectory is compared to the
forecasted trajectories of other road users. Our findings indicate that the
addition of CATPlan can lead to safer end-to-end AD systems and hope that our
work will spark increased interest in uncertainty quantification for such
systems.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-10 14:58:16</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Autonomous navigation in intelligent mobile systems represents a core
research focus within artificial intelligence-driven robotics. Contemporary
path planning approaches face constraints in dynamic environmental
responsiveness and multi-objective task scalability, limiting their capacity to
address growing intelligent operation requirements. Decision-centric
reinforcement learning frameworks, capitalizing on their unique strengths in
adaptive environmental interaction and self-optimization, have gained
prominence in advanced control system research. This investigation introduces
methodological improvements to address sample homogeneity challenges in
reinforcement learning experience replay mechanisms. By incorporating
determinant point processes (DPP) for diversity assessment, we develop a
dual-criteria sampling framework with adaptive selection protocols. This
approach resolves representation bias in conventional prioritized experience
replay (PER) systems while preserving algorithmic interoperability, offering
improved decision optimization for dynamic operational scenarios. Key
contributions comprise: Develop a hybrid sampling paradigm (PER-DPP) combining
priority sequencing with diversity maximization.Based on this,create an
integrated optimization scheme (PER-DPP-Elastic DQN) merging diversity-aware
sampling with adaptive step-size regulation. Comparative simulations in 2D
navigation scenarios demonstrate that the elastic step-size component
temporarily delays initial convergence speed but synergistically enhances
final-stage optimization with PER-DPP integration. The synthesized method
generates navigation paths with optimized length efficiency and directional
stability.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-10 13:50:23</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recent years have seen significant advances in world models, which primarily
focus on learning fine-grained correlations between an agent's motion
trajectory and the resulting changes in its surrounding environment. However,
existing methods often struggle to capture such fine-grained correlations and
achieve real-time predictions. To address this, we propose a new 4D occupancy
world model for autonomous driving, termed T$^3$Former. T$^3$Former begins by
pre-training a compact triplane representation that efficiently compresses the
3D semantically occupied environment. Next, T$^3$Former extracts multi-scale
temporal motion features from the historical triplane and employs an
autoregressive approach to iteratively predict the next triplane changes.
Finally, T$^3$Former combines the triplane changes with the previous ones to
decode them into future occupancy results and ego-motion trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of T$^3$Former, achieving
1.44$\times$ faster inference speed (26 FPS), while improving the mean IoU to
36.09 and reducing the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.</p>

<p class='card-text'>With the advancement of multi-robot technology, cooperative exploration tasks
have garnered increasing attention. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of multi-robot cooperative exploration systems. First, we review the evolution
of robotic exploration and introduce a modular research framework tailored for
multi-robot cooperative exploration. Based on this framework, we systematically
categorize and summarize key system components. As a foundational module for
multi-robot exploration, the localization and mapping module is primarily
introduced by focusing on global and relative pose estimation, as well as
multi-robot map merging techniques. The cooperative motion module is further
divided into learning-based approaches and multi-stage planning, with the
latter encompassing target generation, task allocation, and motion planning
strategies. Given the communication constraints of real-world environments, we
also analyze the communication module, emphasizing how robots exchange
information within local communication ranges and under limited transmission
capabilities. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future research directions
for multi-robot cooperative exploration in light of real-world trends. This
review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners

<p class='card-text'>Collaborative robotics cells leverage heterogeneous agents to provide agile
production solutions. Effective coordination is essential to prevent
inefficiencies and risks for human operators working alongside robots. This
paper proposes a human-aware task allocation and scheduling model based on
Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming to optimize efficiency and safety starting
from task planning stages. The approach exploits synergies that encode the
coupling effects between pairs of tasks executed in parallel by the agents,
arising from the safety constraints imposed on robot agents. These terms are
learned from previous executions using a Bayesian estimation; the inference of
the posterior probability distribution of the synergy coefficients is performed
using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The synergy enhances task planning
by adapting the nominal duration of the plan according to the effect of the
operator's presence. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method produces improved human-aware task plans, reducing unuseful
interference between agents, increasing human-robot distance, and achieving up
to an 18\% reduction in process execution time.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-10 11:50:15</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Accurate agricultural weed mapping using UAVs is crucial for precision
farming applications. Traditional methods rely on orthomosaic stitching from
rigid flight paths, which is computationally intensive and time-consuming.
Gaussian Process (GP)-based mapping offers continuous modelling of the
underlying variable (i.e. weed distribution) but requires discretisation for
practical tasks like path planning or visualisation. Current implementations
often default to quadtrees or gridmaps without systematically evaluating
alternatives. This study compares five discretisation methods: quadtrees,
wedgelets, top-down binary space partition (BSP) trees using least square error
(LSE), bottom-up BSP trees using graph merging, and variable-resolution
hexagonal grids. Evaluations on real-world weed distributions measure visual
similarity, mean squared error (MSE), and computational efficiency. Results
show quadtrees perform best overall, but alternatives excel in specific
scenarios: hexagons or BSP LSE suit fields with large, dominant weed patches,
while quadtrees are optimal for dispersed small-scale distributions. These
findings highlight the need to tailor discretisation approaches to weed
distribution patterns (patch size, density, coverage) rather than relying on
default methods. By choosing representations based on the underlying
distribution, we can improve mapping accuracy and efficiency for precision
agriculture applications.</p>

However, there is a critical need for a systematic framework to guide the

multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and
transportation engineering, present the first comprehensive framework for

taxonomy that categorizes existing applications and methodologies into two
perspectives: transportation planning tasks and computational techniques. From
the transportation planning perspective, we examine the role of GenAI in
automating descriptive, predictive, generative, simulation, and explainable
tasks to enhance mobility systems. From the computational perspective, we
detail advancements in data preparation, domain-specific fine-tuning, and

critical challenges, including data scarcity, explainability, bias mitigation,

<p class='card-text'>Future robots are envisioned as versatile systems capable of performing a
variety of household tasks. The big question remains, how can we bridge the
embodiment gap while minimizing physical robot learning, which fundamentally
does not scale well. We argue that learning from in-the-wild human videos
offers a promising solution for robotic manipulation tasks, as vast amounts of
relevant data already exist on the internet. In this work, we present VidBot, a
framework enabling zero-shot robotic manipulation using learned 3D affordance
from in-the-wild monocular RGB-only human videos. VidBot leverages a pipeline
to extract explicit representations from them, namely 3D hand trajectories from
videos, combining a depth foundation model with structure-from-motion
techniques to reconstruct temporally consistent, metric-scale 3D affordance
representations agnostic to embodiments. We introduce a coarse-to-fine
affordance learning model that first identifies coarse actions from the pixel
space and then generates fine-grained interaction trajectories with a diffusion
model, conditioned on coarse actions and guided by test-time constraints for
context-aware interaction planning, enabling substantial generalization to
novel scenes and embodiments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of
VidBot, which significantly outperforms counterparts across 13 manipulation
tasks in zero-shot settings and can be seamlessly deployed across robot systems
in real-world environments. VidBot paves the way for leveraging everyday human

<p class='card-text'>Building predictive models for tabular data presents fundamental challenges,
notably in scaling consistently, i.e., more resources translating to better
performance, and generalizing systematically beyond the training data
distribution. Designing decision tree models remains especially challenging
given the intractably large search space, and most existing methods rely on
greedy heuristics, while deep learning inductive biases expect a temporal or
spatial structure not naturally present in tabular data. We propose a hybrid
amortized structure inference approach to learn predictive decision tree
ensembles given data, formulating decision tree construction as a sequential
planning problem. We train a deep reinforcement learning (GFlowNet) policy to
solve this problem, yielding a generative model that samples decision trees
from the Bayesian posterior. We show that our approach, DT-GFN, outperforms
state-of-the-art decision tree and deep learning methods on standard
classification benchmarks derived from real-world data, robustness to
distribution shifts, and anomaly detection, all while yielding interpretable
models with shorter description lengths. Samples from the trained DT-GFN model
can be ensembled to construct a random forest, and we further show that the

<p class='card-text'>With increased global warming, there has been a significant emphasis to
replace fossil fuel-dependent energy sources with clean, renewable sources.
These new-age energy systems are becoming more complex with an increasing
proportion of renewable energy sources (like solar and wind), energy storage
systems (like batteries), and demand side control in the mix. Most new-age
sources being highly dependent on weather and climate conditions bring about
high variability and uncertainty. Energy operators rely on such uncertain data
to make different planning and operations decisions periodically, and sometimes
in real-time, to maintain the grid stability and optimize their objectives
(cost savings, carbon footprint, etc.). Hitherto, operators mostly rely on
domain knowledge, heuristics, or solve point problems to take decisions. These
approaches fall short because of their specific assumptions and limitations.
Further, there is a lack of a unified framework for both research and
production environments at scale. In this paper, we propose EnCortex to address
these challenges. EnCortex provides a general, easy-to-use, extensible, and
scalable energy decision framework that enables operators to plan, build and
execute their real-world scenarios efficiently. We show that using EnCortex, we
can define and compose complex new-age scenarios, owing to industry-standard
abstractions of energy entities and the modularity of the framework. EnCortex
provides a foundational structure to support several state-of-the-art
optimizers with minimal effort. EnCortex supports both quick developments for
research prototypes and scaling the solutions to production environments. We
demonstrate the utility of EnCortex with three complex new-age real-world

the cost of investment in both short- and long-term measures against the cost

<p class='card-text'>How can we build generalist robot systems? Scale may not be enough due to the
significant multimodality of robotics tasks, lack of easily accessible data and
the challenges of deploying on physical hardware. Meanwhile, most deployed
robotic systems today are inherently modular and can leverage the independent
generalization capabilities of each module to perform well. Therefore, this
thesis seeks to tackle the task of building generalist robot agents by
integrating these components into one: combining modularity with large-scale
learning for general purpose robot control. The first question we consider is:
how can we build modularity and hierarchy into learning systems? Our key
insight is that rather than having the agent learn hierarchy and low-level
control end-to-end, we can enforce modularity via planning to enable more
efficient and capable robot learners. Next, we come to the role of scale in
building generalist robot systems. To scale, neural networks require vast
amounts of diverse data, expressive architectures to fit the data and a source
of supervision to generate the data. We leverage a powerful supervision source:
classical planning, which can generalize, but is expensive to run and requires
access to privileged information to perform well in practice. We use these
planners to supervise large-scale policy learning in simulation to produce
generalist agents. Finally, we consider how to unify modularity with
large-scale policy learning to build real-world robot systems capable of
performing zero-shot manipulation. We do so by tightly integrating key
ingredients of modular high and mid-level planning, learned local control,
procedural scene generation and large-scale policy learning for sim2real
transfer. We demonstrate that this recipe can produce a single, generalist
agent that can solve challenging long-horizon manipulation tasks in the real
world.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurately visualizing and editing tumor progression in medical imaging is
crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical communication. To
address the challenges of subjectivity and limited precision in existing
methods, we propose SkEditTumor, a sketch-based diffusion model for
controllable tumor progression editing. By leveraging sketches as structural
priors, our method enables precise modifications of tumor regions while
maintaining structural integrity and visual realism. We evaluate SkEditTumor on
four public datasets - BraTS, LiTS, KiTS, and MSD-Pancreas - covering diverse
organs and imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior image fidelity and
segmentation accuracy. Our contributions include a novel integration of
sketches with diffusion models for medical image editing, fine-grained control
over tumor progression visualization, and extensive validation across multiple
datasets, setting a new benchmark in the field.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We tackle safe trajectory planning under Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
uncertainty. Specifically, we use a GMM to model the multimodal behaviors of
obstacles' uncertain states. Then, we develop a mixed-integer conic
approximation to the chance-constrained trajectory planning problem with
deterministic linear systems and polyhedral obstacles. When the GMM moments are
estimated via finite samples, we develop a tight concentration bound to ensure
the chance constraint with a desired confidence. Moreover, to limit the amount
of constraint violation, we develop a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach
corresponding to the chance constraints and derive a tractable approximation
for known and estimated GMM moments. We verify our methods with

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-09 20:23:12</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Sampling-based motion planning algorithms, like the Rapidly-Exploring Random
Tree (RRT) and its widely used variant, RRT-Connect, provide efficient
solutions for high-dimensional planning problems faced by real-world robots.
However, these methods remain computationally intensive, particularly in
complex environments that require many collision checks. As such, to improve
performance, recent efforts have explored parallelizing specific components of
RRT, such as collision checking or running multiple planners independently, but
no prior work has integrated parallelism at multiple levels of the algorithm
for robotic manipulation. In this work, we present pRRTC, a GPU-accelerated
implementation of RRT-Connect that achieves parallelism across the entire
algorithm through multithreaded expansion and connection, SIMT-optimized
collision checking, and hierarchical parallelism optimization, improving
efficiency, consistency, and initial solution cost. We evaluate the
effectiveness of pRRTC on the MotionBenchMaker dataset using robots with 7, 8,
and 14 degrees-of-freedom, demonstrating up to 6x average speedup on
constrained reaching tasks at high collision checking resolution compared to
state-of-the-art. pRRTC also demonstrates a 5x reduction in solution time
variance and 1.5x improvement in initial path costs compared to
state-of-the-art motion planners in complex environments across all robots.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Non-Abelian anyons such as Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have the potential to
enable fault-tolerant quantum computing through topological protection.
Experimentally reported InSb topological superconductor nanowires (TSNW) are
investigated theoretically and numerically to evaluate their suitability to

eigenenergies, Majorana wave functions via local density of states,
transmission spectra for Andreev processes, and zero-bias conductance peaks
(ZBCPs) in InSb TSNWs. For 1.6 {\mu}m- and 2.2 {\mu}m-long InSb TSNWs we
demonstrate the existence of the optimum design space defined by the applied

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-09 14:31:46</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We propose CLAD -- a Constrained Latent Action Diffusion model for
vision-language procedure planning in instructional videos. Procedure planning
is the challenging task of predicting intermediate actions given a visual
observation of a start and a goal state. However, future interactive AI systems
must also be able to plan procedures using multi-modal input, e.g., where
visual observations are augmented with language descriptions. To tackle this
vision-language procedure planning task, our method uses a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) to learn the latent representation of actions and
observations as constraints and integrate them into the diffusion process. This
approach exploits that the latent space of diffusion models already has
semantics that can be used. We use the latent constraints to steer the
diffusion model to better generate actions. We report extensive experiments on
the popular CrossTask, Coin, and NIV datasets and show that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. By evaluating ablated
versions of our method, we further show that the proposed integration of the
action and observation representations learnt in the VAE latent space is key to
these performance improvements.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The capture of flying MAVs (micro aerial vehicles) has garnered increasing
research attention due to its intriguing challenges and promising applications.
Despite recent advancements, a key limitation of existing work is that capture
strategies are often relatively simple and constrained by platform performance.
This paper addresses control strategies capable of capturing
high-maneuverability targets. The unique challenge of achieving target capture
under unstable conditions distinguishes this task from traditional
pursuit-evasion and guidance problems. In this study, we transition from larger
MAV platforms to a specially designed, compact capture MAV equipped with a
custom launching device while maintaining high maneuverability. We explore both
time-optimal planning (TOP) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods.
Simulations demonstrate that TOP offers highly maneuverable and shorter
trajectories, while RL excels in real-time adaptability and stability.
Moreover, the RL method has been tested in real-world scenarios, successfully
achieving target capture even in unstable states.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promising advancements in
sequential decision-making tasks through task-specific fine-tuning. However,
common fine-tuning methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO),
present notable limitations: SFT assumes Independent and Identically
Distributed (IID) data, while PPO focuses on maximizing cumulative rewards.
These limitations often restrict solution diversity and hinder generalization
in multi-step reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a
novel framework, GFlowVLM, a framework that fine-tune VLMs using Generative
Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to promote generation of diverse solutions for
complex reasoning tasks. GFlowVLM models the environment as a non-Markovian
decision process, allowing it to capture long-term dependencies essential for
real-world applications. It takes observations and task descriptions as inputs
to prompt chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning which subsequently guides action
selection. We use task based rewards to fine-tune VLM with GFlowNets. This
approach enables VLMs to outperform prior fine-tuning methods, including SFT
and RL. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of GFlowVLM on complex
tasks such as card games (NumberLine, BlackJack) and embodied planning tasks
(ALFWorld), showing enhanced training efficiency, solution diversity, and
stronger generalization capabilities across both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Urban centers serve as engines of regional development, yet accurately
defining and identifying the socioeconomic centers of cities globally remains a
big challenge. Existing mapping efforts are often limited to large cities in
developed regions and rely on data sources that are unavailable in many
developing countries. This data scarcity hinders the establishment of
consistent urban indicators, such as accessibility, to assess progress towards
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here, we develop and
validate a global map of the socioeconomic centers of cities for 2020 by
integrating nighttime light and population density data within an advanced
geospatial modeling framework. Our analysis reveals that monocentric cities --
the standard urban model -- still dominate our planet, accounting for over 80%
of cities worldwide. However, these monocentric cities encompass only
approximately 20% of the total urbanized area, urban population, and nighttime
light intensity; this 80/20 pattern underscores significant disparities in
urban development. Further analysis, combined with socioeconomic datasets,
reveals a marked difference between developed and developing regions:
high-income countries exhibit greater polycentricity than low-income countries,
demonstrating a positive correlation between urban sprawl and economic growth.
Our global dataset and findings provide critical insights into urban structure
and development, with important implications for urban planning, policymaking,
and the formulation of indicators for urban sustainability assessment.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-09 03:16:21</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Nondestructive one-shot device (NOSD) testing plays a crucial role in
engineering, particularly in the reliability assessment of high-stakes systems
such as aerospace components, medical devices, and semiconductor technologies.
Accurate reliability prognosis of NOSD testing data is essential for ensuring
product durability, safety, and performance optimization. The conventional
estimation methods like maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) are sensitive to
data contamination, leading to biased results. Consequently, this study
develops robust inferential analysis for NOSD testing data under a progressive
stress model. The lifetime of NOSD is assumed to follow Log-logistic
distribution. The estimation procedure addresses robustness by incorporating
Exponential-polynomial divergence (EPD). Equipped with three tuning parameters,
EPD based estimation is proven to be more flexible than density power
divergence estimation frequently used for one-shot device testing data
analysis. Further, we explore the asymptotic behaviour of minimum EPD estimator
(MEPDE) for large sample size. The robustness of MEPDE is analytically studied
through influence function. Since tradeoff between efficiency and robustness of
EPD based estimation is governed by three tuning parameters, a novel approach
leveraging Concrete Score Matching (CSM) is introduced to optimize the tuning
parameters of MEPDE. Moreover, a comparative study with the existing methods of
finding tuning parameters is conducted through extensive simulation experiment
and data analysis. Another aspect of this study is determining an optimal plan
to ensure a successful ALT experiment within specified budget and time
constraints. It is designed on A-optimality criteria subject to the given
constraints and is executed using the constraint particle swarm optimization
(CPSO) algorithm.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The absence of observed charmonium-like states with the exotic quantum

<p class='card-text'>Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical diagnosis, surgical

tackle all medical image segmentation scenarios via one-time learning. However,
in practical applications, the diversity of scenarios and tasks in medical

introduce EvoSAM, a dynamically evolving medical image segmentation model that
continuously accumulates new knowledge from an ever-expanding array of

evaluations on surgical image blood vessel segmentation and multi-site prostate
MRI segmentation demonstrate that EvoSAM not only improves segmentation
accuracy but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Further experiments
conducted by surgical clinicians on blood vessel segmentation confirm that
EvoSAM enhances segmentation efficiency based on user prompts, highlighting its
