<p class='card-text'>Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video
generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling.
However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with
flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning.
This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint
distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially
constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose
Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized
spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled
spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from
fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video
prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an
end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration
generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to
address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes
longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model
further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end
planners on NAVSIM benchmarks. Code will be publicly available at

  Barriers in Urban Space</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Guangyuan Weng, Minsuk Kim, Yong-Yeol Ahn, Esteban Moro</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-30 17:08:26</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Human mobility in cities is shaped not only by visible structures such as
highways, rivers, and parks but also by invisible barriers rooted in
socioeconomic segregation, uneven access to amenities, and administrative
divisions. Yet identifying and quantifying these barriers at scale and their
relative importance on people's movements remains a major challenge. Neural
embedding models, originally developed for language, offer a powerful way to
capture the complexity of human mobility from large-scale data. Here, we apply
this approach to 25.4 million observed trajectories across 11 major U.S.
cities, learning mobility embeddings that reveal how people move through urban
space. These mobility embeddings define a functional distance between places,
one that reflects behavioral rather than physical proximity, and allow us to
detect barriers between neighborhoods that are geographically close but
behaviorally disconnected. We find that the strongest predictors of these
barriers are differences in access to amenities, administrative borders, and
residential segregation by income and race. These invisible borders are
concentrated in urban cores and persist across cities, spatial scales, and time
periods. Physical infrastructure, such as highways and parks, plays a secondary
but still significant role, especially at short distances. We also find that
individuals who cross barriers tend to do so outside of traditional commuting
hours and are more likely to live in areas with greater racial diversity, and
higher transit use or income. Together, these findings reveal how spatial,
social, and behavioral forces structure urban accessibility and provide a
scalable framework to detect and monitor barriers in cities, with applications
in planning, policy evaluation, and equity analysis.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-30 16:22:51</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We introduce Ella, an embodied social agent capable of lifelong learning
within a community in a 3D open world, where agents accumulate experiences and
acquire knowledge through everyday visual observations and social interactions.
At the core of Ella's capabilities is a structured, long-term multimodal memory
system that stores, updates, and retrieves information effectively. It consists
of a name-centric semantic memory for organizing acquired knowledge and a
spatiotemporal episodic memory for capturing multimodal experiences. By
integrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves
relevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social
relationships, and evolves autonomously while coexisting with other intelligent
beings in the open world. We conduct capability-oriented evaluations in a
dynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and
are assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental
results show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents
well to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through
observation and social interaction. Our findings highlight the transformative
potential of combining structured memory systems with foundation models for
advancing embodied intelligence. More videos can be found at

<p class='card-text'>The safe trajectory planning of intelligent and connected vehicles is a key
component in autonomous driving technology. Modeling the environment risk
information by field is a promising and effective approach for safe trajectory
planning. However, existing risk assessment theories only analyze the risk by
current information, ignoring future prediction. This paper proposes a
predictive risk analysis and safe trajectory planning framework for intelligent
and connected vehicles. This framework first predicts future trajectories of
objects by a local risk-aware algorithm, following with a
spatiotemporal-discretised predictive risk analysis using the prediction
results. Then the safe trajectory is generated based on the predictive risk

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-30 15:58:10</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is essential to ensure the safety and
reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) before deployment. However, existing
techniques primarily focus on evaluating ADS functionalities in single-AV
settings. As ADSs are increasingly deployed in multi-AV traffic, it becomes
crucial to assess their cooperative performance, particularly regarding
deadlocks, a fundamental coordination failure in which multiple AVs enter a
circular waiting state indefinitely, resulting in motion planning failures.
Despite its importance, the cooperative capability of ADSs to prevent deadlocks
remains insufficiently underexplored. To address this gap, we propose the first
dedicated Spatio-Temporal Conflict-Guided Deadlock Avoidance Testing technique,
STCLocker, for generating DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs), where a group of AVs
controlled by the ADS under test are in a circular wait state. STCLocker
consists of three key components: Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and
Conflict-aware Scenario Generation. Deadlock Oracle provides a reliable
black-box mechanism for detecting deadlock cycles among multiple AVs within a
given scenario. Conflict Feedback and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation
collaborate to actively guide AVs into simultaneous competition over spatial
conflict resources (i.e., shared passing regions) and temporal competitive
behaviors (i.e., reaching the conflict region at the same time), thereby
increasing the effectiveness of generating conflict-prone deadlocks. We
evaluate STCLocker on two types of ADSs: Roach, an end-to-end ADS, and OpenCDA,
a module-based ADS supporting cooperative communication. Experimental results
show that, on average, STCLocker generates more DLS than the best-performing
baseline.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-30 15:03:35</h6>
<p class='card-text'>As machine learning inferences increasingly move to edge devices, adapting to
diverse computational capabilities, hardware, and memory constraints becomes
more critical. Instead of relying on a pre-trained model fixed for all future
inference queries across diverse edge devices, we argue that planning an
inference pattern with a request-specific model tailored to the device's
computational capacity, accuracy requirements, and time constraints is more
cost-efficient and robust to diverse scenarios. To this end, we propose an
accuracy-aware and workload-balanced inference system that integrates joint
model quantization and inference partitioning. In this approach, the server
dynamically responds to inference queries by sending a quantized model and
adaptively sharing the inference workload with the device. Meanwhile, the
device's computational power, channel capacity, and accuracy requirements are
considered when deciding.
  Furthermore, we introduce a new optimization framework for the inference
system, incorporating joint model quantization and partitioning. Our approach
optimizes layer-wise quantization bit width and partition points to minimize
time consumption and cost while accounting for varying accuracy requirements of
tasks through an accuracy degradation metric in our optimization model. To our
knowledge, this work represents the first exploration of optimizing
quantization layer-wise bit-width in the inference serving system, by
introducing theoretical measurement of accuracy degradation. Simulation results
demonstrate a substantial reduction in overall time and power consumption, with
computation payloads decreasing by over 80% and accuracy degradation kept below
1%.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Resilience non-equilibrium measurement, the ability to maintain fundamental
functionality amidst failures and errors, is crucial for scientific management
and engineering applications of industrial chain. The problem is particularly
challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience
(for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep
learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction
of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network
topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in
real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial
brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework
integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic
reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of
global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure
of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying
assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but
also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning.
Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms
resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up
to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension
reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains
robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest
that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and
planning for industrial chain.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a common abstraction of multi-robot
trajectory planning problems, where multiple homogeneous robots simultaneously
move in the shared environment. While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to
be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world
applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized
suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage.
Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation
learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively
fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging
a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training
while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments
demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF
solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across

<p class='card-text'>Automated inspection with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) is a transformative
capability set to revolutionize various application domains. However, this task
is inherently complex, as it demands the seamless integration of perception,
planning, and control which existing approaches often treat separately.
Moreover, it requires accurate long-horizon planning to predict action
sequences, in contrast to many current techniques, which tend to be myopic. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a 3D inspection approach that unifies
perception, planning, and control within a single data-driven predictive
control framework. Unlike traditional methods that rely on known UAS dynamic
models, our approach requires only input-output data, making it easily
applicable to off-the-shelf black-box UASs. Our method incorporates back-face

<p class='card-text'>Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning, where accurate boundary delineation is essential for
precise lesion localization, organ identification, and quantitative assessment.
In recent years, deep learning-based methods have significantly advanced
segmentation accuracy. However, two major challenges remain. First, the
performance of these methods heavily relies on large-scale annotated datasets,
which are often difficult to obtain in medical scenarios due to privacy
concerns and high annotation costs. Second, clinically challenging scenarios,
such as low contrast in certain imaging modalities and blurry lesion boundaries
caused by malignancy, still pose obstacles to precise segmentation. To address
these challenges, we propose MedSAM-CA, an architecture-level fine-tuning
approach that mitigates reliance on extensive manual annotations by adapting
the pretrained foundation model, Medical Segment Anything (MedSAM). MedSAM-CA
introduces two key components: the Convolutional Attention-Enhanced Boundary
Refinement Network (CBR-Net) and the Attention-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block
(Atte-FFB). CBR-Net operates in parallel with the MedSAM encoder to recover
boundary information potentially overlooked by long-range attention mechanisms,
leveraging hierarchical convolutional processing. Atte-FFB, embedded in the
MedSAM decoder, fuses multi-level fine-grained features from skip connections
in CBR-Net with global representations upsampled within the decoder to enhance
boundary delineation accuracy. Experiments on publicly available datasets
covering dermoscopy, CT, and MRI imaging modalities validate the effectiveness
of MedSAM-CA. On dermoscopy dataset, MedSAM-CA achieves 94.43% Dice with only
2% of full training data, reaching 97.25% of full-data training performance,

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-30 08:19:04</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper introduces a new paradigm of optimal path planning, i.e.,
passage-traversing optimal path planning (PTOPP), that optimizes paths'
traversed passages for specified optimization objectives. In particular, PTOPP
is utilized to find the path with optimal accessible free space along its
entire length, which represents a basic requirement for paths in robotics. As
passages are places where free space shrinks and becomes constrained, the core
idea is to leverage the path's passage traversal status to characterize its
accessible free space comprehensively. To this end, a novel passage detection
and free space decomposition method using proximity graphs is proposed,
enabling fast detection of sparse but informative passages and environment
decompositions. Based on this preprocessing, optimal path planning with
accessible free space objectives or constraints is formulated as PTOPP problems
compatible with sampling-based optimal planners. Then, sampling-based
algorithms for PTOPP, including their dependent primitive procedures, are
developed leveraging partitioned environments for fast passage traversal check.
All these methods are implemented and thoroughly tested for effectiveness and
efficiency validation. Compared to existing approaches, such as clearance-based
methods, PTOPP demonstrates significant advantages in configurability, solution
optimality, and efficiency, addressing prior limitations and incapabilities. It
is believed to provide an efficient and versatile solution to accessible free
space optimization over conventional avenues and more generally, to a broad
class of path planning problems that can be formulated as PTOPP.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Implementing economy-wide decarbonization strategies based on decarbonizing
the power grid via variable renewable energy (VRE) expansion and
electrification of end-uses requires new approaches for energy infrastructure
planning that consider, among other factors, weather-induced uncertainty in
demand and VRE supply. An energy planning model that fails to account for these
uncertainties can hinder the intended transition efforts to a low-carbon grid
and increase the risk of supply shortage especially during extreme weather
conditions. Here, we consider the generation and transmission expansion problem
of joint power-gas infrastructure and operations planning under the uncertainty
of both demand and renewable supply. We propose two distributionally robust
optimization approaches based on moment (MDRO) and Wasserstein distance (WDRO)
ambiguity sets to endogenize these uncertainties and account for the change in
the underlying distribution of these parameters that is caused by the climate
change, among other factors. Furthermore, our model considers the risk-aversion
of the energy planners in the modeling framework via the conditional
value-at-risk (CVaR) metric. An equivalent mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) reformulation of both modeling frameworks is presented, and a
computationally efficient approximation scheme to obtain near-optimal solutions
is proposed. We demonstrate the resulting DRO planning models and solution
strategy via a New England case study under different levels of end-use
electrification and decarbonization targets. Our experiments systematically
explore different modeling aspects and compare the DRO models with stochastic

planning and clinical quantification. However, it remains challenging due to
the rare paired data, complex structures, and US noises. In this study, we
introduce a novel generative framework UltraTwin, to obtain cardiac anatomical
twin from sparse multi-view 2D US. Our contribution is three-fold. First,
pioneered the construction of a real-world and high-quality dataset containing
strictly paired multi-view 2D US and CT, and pseudo-paired data. Second, we
propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to achieve hierarchical reconstruction
optimization. Last, we introduce an implicit autoencoder for topology-aware
constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraTwin reconstructs
high-quality anatomical twins versus strong competitors. We believe it advances
anatomical twin modeling for potential applications in personalized cardiac
care.</p>

  Boundary Layer Structure</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Sooman Han, Juan M. Lora</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-30 02:46:00</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Understanding Titan's planetary boundary layer (PBL) -- the lowest region of
the atmosphere influenced by surface conditions -- remains challenging due to
Titan's thick atmosphere and limited observations. Previous modeling studies
have also produced inconsistent estimates of surface temperature, a critical
determinant of PBL behavior, often without clear explanations grounded in
surface energy balance. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework and
apply a three-dimensional dry general circulation model (GCM) to investigate
how surface thermal inertia influences surface energy balance and temperature
variability across diurnal and seasonal timescales. At diurnal timescales,
lower thermal inertia surfaces exhibit larger temperature swings and enhanced
sensible heat fluxes due to inefficient subsurface heat conduction. In
contrast, at seasonal timescales, surface temperature variations show weak
sensitivity to thermal inertia, as atmospheric damping tends to dominate over
subsurface conduction. The PBL depth ranges from a few hundred meters to 1,000
m on diurnal timescales, while seasonal maxima reach 2,000--3,000 m, supporting
the interpretation from a previous study that the Huygens probe captured the
two PBL structures. Simulated seasonal winds at the Huygens landing site
successfully reproduce key observed features, including near-surface retrograde
winds and meridional wind reversals within the lowest few kilometers,
consistent with Titan's cross-equatorial Hadley circulation. Simulations at the
planned Dragonfly landing site predict shallower thermal PBLs with broadly
similar wind patterns. This work establishes a physically grounded framework
for understanding Titan's surface temperature and boundary layer variability,
and offers a unified explanation of Titan's PBL behavior that provides improved
guidance for future missions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires
agents to execute sequential navigation actions in complex environments guided
by natural language instructions. Current approaches often struggle with
generalizing to novel environments and adapting to ongoing changes during
navigation. Inspired by human cognition, we present NavMorph, a self-evolving
world model framework that enhances environmental understanding and
decision-making in VLN-CE tasks. NavMorph employs compact latent
representations to model environmental dynamics, equipping agents with
foresight for adaptive planning and policy refinement. By integrating a novel
Contextual Evolution Memory, NavMorph leverages scene-contextual information to
support effective navigation while maintaining online adaptability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves notable performance
improvements on popular VLN-CE benchmarks. Code is available at

<p class='card-text'>Efficient identification of picking points is critical for automated fruit
harvesting. Avocados present unique challenges owing to their irregular shape,
weight, and less-structured growing environments, which require specific
viewpoints for successful harvesting. We propose a geometry-based,
semantics-aware viewpoint-planning algorithm to address these challenges. The
planning process involves three key steps: viewpoint sampling, evaluation, and
execution. Starting from a partially occluded view, the system first detects
the fruit, then leverages geometric information to constrain the viewpoint
search space to a 1D circle, and uniformly samples four points to balance the
efficiency and exploration. A new picking score metric is introduced to
evaluate the viewpoint suitability and guide the camera to the next-best view.
We validate our method through simulation against two state-of-the-art
algorithms. Results show a 100% success rate in two case studies with
significant occlusions, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of our
approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/lineojcd/GSNBV</p>

<p class='card-text'>As the US rapidly moves towards cleaner energy sources, solar energy is fast
becoming the pillar of its renewable energy mix. Even while solar energy is
increasingly being used, its variability is a key hindrance to grid stability,
storage efficiency, and system stability overall. Solar energy has emerged as
one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the United States,
adding noticeably to the country's energy mix. Retrospectively, the necessity
of inserting the sun's energy into the grid without disrupting reliability and
cost efficiencies highlights the necessity of good forecasting software and
smart control systems. The dataset utilized for this research project comprised
both hourly and daily solar energy production records collected from multiple
utility-scale solar farms across diverse U.S. regions, including California,
Texas, and Arizona. Training and evaluation of all models were performed with a
time-based cross-validation scheme, namely, sliding window validation. Both the
Random Forest and the XG-Boost models demonstrated noticeably greater and the
same performance across each of the measures considered, with relatively high
accuracy. The almost perfect and equal performance by the Random Forest and
XG-Boost models also shows both models to have learned the patterns in the data
very comprehensively, with high reliability in their predictions. By
incorporating AI-powered time-series models like XG-Boost in grid management
software, utility companies can dynamically modify storage cycles in real-time
as well as dispatch and peak load planning, based on their predictions.
AI-powered solar forecasting also has profound implications for renewable
energy policy and planning, particularly as U.S. federal and state governments
accelerate toward ambitious decarbonization goals.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In contemporary surgical research and practice, accurately comprehending 3D
surgical scenes with text-promptable capabilities is particularly crucial for
surgical planning and real-time intra-operative guidance, where precisely
identifying and interacting with surgical tools and anatomical structures is
paramount. However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model
(VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for
real-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a
novel text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method to fill this gap. We introduce
a 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything
model and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented
language features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more
in-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose
semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of
semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and
semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization,
which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training,
particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to
demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices. SurgTPGS paves
the way for developing next-generation intelligent surgical systems by
enhancing surgical precision and safety. Our code is available at:

<p class='card-text'>Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations rely on rigid rule-based
systems that fail to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral
diversity characteristic of human travel decision-making. Recent advances in
large language models and AI agent technology offer opportunities to create
agents with reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning
mechanisms. We propose GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel
framework that leverages these advances to create generative agents with rich
behavioral characteristics for urban mobility simulation. Unlike conventional
approaches, GATSim agents possess diverse socioeconomic attributes, individual
lifestyles, and evolving preferences that shape their mobility decisions
through psychologically-informed memory systems, tool usage capabilities, and
lifelong learning mechanisms. The main contributions of this study include: (1)
a comprehensive architecture combining an urban mobility foundation model with
agent cognitive systems and transport simulation environment, (2) a fully
functional prototype implementation, and (3) systematic validation
demonstrating that generative agents produce believable travel behaviors.
Through designed reflection processes, generative agents in this study can
transform specific travel experiences into generalized insights, enabling
realistic behavioral adaptation over time with specialized mechanisms for
activity planning and real-time reactive behaviors tailored to urban mobility
contexts. Experiments show that generative agents perform competitively with
human annotators in mobility scenarios while naturally producing macroscopic
traffic evolution patterns. The code for the prototype system is shared at

<p class='card-text'>This paper investigates the joint optimization of trajectory planning and
resource allocation for a high-altitude platform stations synthetic aperture
radar (HAPs-SAR) system. To support real-time sensing and conserve the limited
energy budget of the HAPs, the proposed framework assumes that the acquired
radar data are transmitted in real time to a ground base station for SAR image
reconstruction. A dynamic trajectory model is developed, and the power
consumption associated with radar sensing, data transmission, and circular
flight is comprehensively analyzed. In addition, solar energy harvesting is
considered to enhance system sustainability. An energy-aware mixed-integer
nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to maximize radar beam
coverage while satisfying operational constraints. To solve this challenging
problem, a sub-optimal successive convex approximation (SCA)-based framework is
proposed, incorporating iterative optimization and finite search. Simulation
results validate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its
effectiveness in balancing SAR performance, communication reliability, and
energy efficiency. A final SAR imaging simulation on a 9-target lattice
scenario further confirms the practical feasibility of the proposed solution.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Computational fluid dynamics of the air flow in the human nasal cavities,
starting from patient-specific Computer Tomography (CT) scans, is an important
tool for diagnostics and surgery planning. However, a complete and systematic
assessment of the influence of the main modeling assumptions is still lacking.
In designing such simulations, choosing the discretization scheme, which is the
main subject of the present work, is an often overlooked decision of primary
importance. We use a comparison framework to quantify the effects of the major
design choices on the results. The reconstructed airways of a healthy,
representative adult patient are used to set up a computational study where
such effects are systematically measured. It is found that the choice of the
numerical scheme is the most important aspect, although all varied parameters
impact the solution noticeably. For a physiologically meaningful flow rate,
changes of the global pressure drop up to more than 50\% are observed; locally,
velocity differences can become extremely significant. Our results call for an

<p class='card-text'>Optimal collision-free formation control of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)

numerical methods sensitive to initial guesses. This paper presents an
innovative collision-free finite-time formation control scheme for multiple
UAVs leveraging the differential flatness of the UAV dynamics, eliminating the
need for numerical methods. We formulate a finite-time optimal control problem
to plan a formation trajectory for feasible initial states. This optimal
control problem in formation trajectory planning involves a collective
performance index to meet the formation requirements to achieve relative
positions and velocity consensus. It is solved by applying Pontryagin's
principle. Subsequently, a collision-constrained regulating problem is
addressed to ensure collision-free tracking of the planned formation
trajectory. The tracking problem incorporates a directionally aware collision
avoidance strategy that prioritizes avoiding UAVs in the forward path and
relative approach. It assigns lower priority to those on the sides with an
oblique relative approach, disregarding UAVs behind and not in the relative

<p class='card-text'>Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image
processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop
effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current
multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details,
dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing
these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal
Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a
promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual
descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual
inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive
cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into
the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.
To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting
strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of
challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy
for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical
imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on
seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models.
Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby
confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations
mentioned earlier. Our code is available at:

<p class='card-text'>This study presents a rigorous assessment of the growth performance of
Gmelina arborea (melina) in a 67-hectare plantation located in Chontaduro,
Tabiazo Parish, Esmeraldas, Ecuador. The plantation was established in 2017
under a high-density planting system (650 trees/ha). Permanent monitoring
techniques were applied in 16 one-hectare plots to analyze structural growth
variables, including survival rate, diameter at breast height (DBH), total
height, commercial height, basal area, volume, and mean annual increment (MAI).
The results show an average survival rate of 80.2%, with a mean DBH of 25.3 cm
at five years, indicating sustained growth under favorable edaphoclimatic
conditions. Volume was calculated using the equation V = G HT Ff, yielding
average values of 183.262 m3 for total volume and 166.19 m3 for commercial
volume. The estimated MAI for diameter and height was 5.06 cm/year and 3.61
m/year, respectively, with values comparable to studies conducted in other
Ecuadorian sites, although lower productivity was observed in Esmeraldas,
attributed to edaphic and climatic differences identified through soil type and
environmental condition analyses. The research highlights the significant
influence of edaphic conditions, silvicultural management, and environmental
variables on the performance of Gmelina arborea in tropical Ecuador. The
findings provide a foundation for optimizing forest management strategies and
improving growth indicators in commercial plantations, contributing to the
sustainable development of forest resources in the region and strengthening
silvicultural planning based on predictive models tailored to local conditions.
This study represents a step forward in the scientific assessment of melina
growth under Ecuadorian conditions, promoting more precise and sustainable
silvicultural practices</p>
