<p class='card-text'>Minimizing intermediate results is critical for efficient multi-join query
processing. Although the seminal Yannakakis algorithm offers strong guarantees
for acyclic queries, cyclic queries remain an open challenge. In this paper, we
propose SplitJoin, a framework that introduces split as a first-class query
operator. By partitioning input tables into heavy and light parts, SplitJoin
allows different data partitions to use distinct query plans, with the goal of
reducing intermediate sizes using existing binary join engines. We
systematically explore the design space for split-based optimizations,
including threshold selection, split strategies, and join ordering after
splits. Implemented as a front-end to DuckDB and Umbra, SplitJoin achieves
substantial improvements: on DuckDB, SplitJoin completes 43 social network
queries (vs. 29 natively), achieving 2.1x faster runtime and 7.9x smaller
intermediates on average (up to 13.6x and 74x, respectively); on Umbra, it
completes 45 queries (vs. 35), achieving 1.3x speedups and 1.2x smaller
intermediates on average (up to 6.1x and 2.1x, respectively).</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has gained significant attention, with most
research focusing on minimizing collisions and travel time. This paper also
considers energy consumption in the path planning of automated guided vehicles

that takes both energy use and travel time into account. For task assignment,
we present two multi-objective algorithms: Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic

<p class='card-text'>We present a dataset generated to investigate urban heat and thermal
perception across five neighborhoods in the Barcelona metropolitan area. In
collaboration with 14 non-academic partner organizations, we conducted a series
of citizen science campaigns involving 439 residents as co-researchers engaged
throughout all stages of the research process. Participants, residents of areas
classified as highly or very highly climate-vulnerable, identified 210 public
outdoor sites relevant to their daily lives. These locations were subsequently
characterized using a range of spatial and environmental indicators pertinent
to urban heat island effects, urban health, and climate resilience. Over the
course of 48 thermal walks, participants carried portable, low-cost sensors
that continuously recorded air temperature, relative humidity, and geolocation,
resulting in 296,286 processed microclimatic data points. At pre-defined sites,
individuals completed standardized surveys to report their Thermal Sensation
Votes and Thermal Comfort Votes, yielding 5,169 self-reported entries.
Sociodemographic data were also collected to further contextualize
participants' responses. The resulting dataset integrates objective
environmental measurements with subjective perceptions of heat, enabling
point-by-point analysis of thermal experience within the urban fabric. It
offers a novel, multi-dimensional resource to support research on heat, thermal
inequality, and the experiential dimensions of climate vulnerability, and is
intended to inform evidence-based decision-making in urban planning, public
health, and climate adaptation.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-29 15:39:53</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Long-horizon contact-rich bimanual manipulation presents a significant
challenge, requiring complex coordination involving a mixture of parallel
execution and sequential collaboration between arms. In this paper, we
introduce a hierarchical framework that frames this challenge as an integrated
skill planning & scheduling problem, going beyond purely sequential
decision-making to support simultaneous skill invocation. Our approach is built
upon a library of single-arm and bimanual primitive skills, each trained using
Reinforcement Learning (RL) in GPU-accelerated simulation. We then train a
Transformer-based planner on a dataset of skill compositions to act as a
high-level scheduler, simultaneously predicting the discrete schedule of skills
as well as their continuous parameters. We demonstrate that our method achieves
higher success rates on complex, contact-rich tasks than end-to-end RL
approaches and produces more efficient, coordinated behaviors than traditional
sequential-only planners.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-29 14:12:45</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In task and motion planning, high-level task planning is done over an
abstraction of the world to enable efficient search in long-horizon robotics
problems. However, the feasibility of these task-level plans relies on the
downward refinability of the abstraction into continuous motion. When a
domain's refinability is poor, task-level plans that appear valid may
ultimately fail during motion planning, requiring replanning and resulting in
slower overall performance. Prior works mitigate this by encoding refinement
issues as constraints to prune infeasible task plans. However, these approaches
only add constraints upon refinement failure, expending significant search
effort on infeasible branches. We propose VIZ-COAST, a method of leveraging the
common-sense spatial reasoning of large pretrained Vision-Language Models to
identify issues with downward refinement a priori, bypassing the need to fix
these failures during planning. Experiments on two challenging TAMP domains
show that our approach is able to extract plausible constraints from images and
domain descriptions, drastically reducing planning times and, in some cases,
eliminating downward refinement failures altogether, generalizing to a diverse
range of instances from the broader domain.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-29 13:46:19</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-29 13:27:47</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We present a vector-based method to balance chemical reactions. The algorithm
builds candidates in a deterministic way, removes duplicates, and always prints
coefficients in the lowest whole-number form. For redox cases, electrons and
protons/hydroxide are treated explicitly, so both mass and charge are balanced.
We also outline the basic principles of the vector formulation of
stoichiometry, interpreting reactions as integer vectors in composition space,
this geometric view supports compact visualizations of reagent-product
interactions and helps surface distinct reaction families. The method
enumerates valid balances for arbitrary user-specified species lists without
special-case balancing rules or symbolic tricks, and it provides a clean
foundation for developing new algorithmic variants (e.g., alternative
objectives or constraints). On representative examples (neutralization, double
displacement, decomposition, classical redox, small multicomponent sets) and a
negative control, the method produced correct integer balances. When multiple
balances exist, we report a canonical one - minimizing the total coefficient
sum with a simple tie-breaker - without claiming global optimality beyond the
solutions the search enumerates. The procedure applies per reaction and extends
to reaction networks via consistent per-reaction application. We do not report

<p class='card-text'>Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.</p>

systems that extend large language models with additional capabilities to plan,
use tools, remember, and act toward specific goals. Yet despite their promise,
developers face persistent and often underexplored challenges when building,

challenges, we study developer discussions on Stack Overflow, the world's
largest developer-focused Q and A platform with about 60 million questions and
answers and 30 million users. We construct a taxonomy of developer challenges
through tag expansion and filtering, apply LDA-MALLET for topic modeling, and
manually validate and label the resulting themes. Our analysis reveals seven
major areas of recurring issues encompassing 77 distinct technical challenges
related to runtime integration, dependency management, orchestration

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-29 11:42:19</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Formation control simplifies minimizing multi-robot cost functions by
encoding a cost function as a shape the robots maintain. However, by reducing
complex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining
the shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or
Box formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation.
When more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a
static shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose
a formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost
function while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation
planner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative
robot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear
and non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions.
We theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do
not need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized
using relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are
realized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's
direct approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for
military-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,
we show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When
minimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation
planner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning
provides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that
closely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape
abstraction.</p>

significant challenges for autonomous vehicles, primarily due to the
uncertainty of human driver behavior and the non-convex nature of collision
avoidance constraints. This paper introduces a stochastic optimal control
framework to address these issues simultaneously, without excessively
conservative approximations. We opt to model human driver decisions as a Markov
Decision Process and propose a method for handling collision avoidance between
non-convex vehicle shapes by imposing a positive distance constraint between
compact sets. In this framework, we investigate three alternative chance
constraint formulations. To ensure computational tractability, we introduce
tight, continuously differentiable reformulations of both the non-convex

<p class='card-text'>The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a Compton telescope designed to
survey the 0.2 - 5 MeV sky, consisting of a compact array of cross-strip
germanium detectors. It is planned to be launched in 2027 into an equatorial
low-Earth (530 km) orbit with a prime mission duration of 2 years. The
observation of MeV gamma rays is dominated by background, mostly from
extragalactic and atmospheric photon but also from the activation of the
detector materials induced by cosmic-ray interactions. Thus, background
simulation and identification are crucial for the data analysis. In this work
we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the background for the first 3 months in
orbit, and we extrapolate the results to 2 years in orbit, in order to
determine the build-up of the activation due to long-lived isotopes. We
determine the rates of events induced by the background that are reconstructed
as Compton events in the simulated COSI data. We find that the extragalactic
background photons dominate at low energies (<660 keV), while delayed
activation from cosmic-ray primaries (proton/alpha) and albedo photons dominate
at higher energies. As part of this work, a comparison at low latitude (<1 deg)
between recent measurement of the SAA by the High-Energy Particle Detector

<p class='card-text'>Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502

clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-29 05:30:57</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Electricity demand and generation have become increasingly unpredictable with
the growing share of variable renewable energy sources in the power system.
Forecasting electricity supply by fuel mix is crucial for market operation,
ensuring grid stability, optimizing costs, integrating renewable energy
sources, and supporting sustainable energy planning. We introduce two
statistical methods, centering on forecast reconciliation and compositional
data analysis, to forecast short-term electricity supply by different types of
fuel mix. Using data for five electricity markets in Australia, we study the
forecast accuracy of these techniques. The bottom-up hierarchical forecasting
method consistently outperforms the other approaches. Moreover, fuel mix
forecasting is most accurate in power systems with a higher share of stable
fossil fuel generation.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Yatao Zhang, Ye Hong, Song Gao, Martin Raubal</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-29 04:13:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Understanding how urban systems and traffic dynamics co-evolve is crucial for
advancing sustainable and resilient cities. However, their bidirectional causal
relationships remain underexplored due to challenges of simultaneously
inferring spatial heterogeneity, temporal variation, and feedback mechanisms.
To address this gap, we propose a novel spatio-temporal causality framework
that bridges correlation and causation by integrating spatio-temporal weighted
regression with a newly developed spatio-temporal convergent cross-mapping
approach. Characterizing cities through urban structure, form, and function,
the framework uncovers bidirectional causal patterns between urban systems and
traffic dynamics across 30 cities on six continents. Our findings reveal
asymmetric bidirectional causality, with urban systems exerting stronger
influences on traffic dynamics than the reverse in most cities. Urban form and
function shape mobility more profoundly than structure, even though structure
often exhibits higher correlations, as observed in cities such as Singapore,
New Delhi, London, Chicago, and Moscow. This does not preclude the reversed
causal direction, whereby long-established mobility patterns can also reshape
the built environment over time. Finally, we identify three distinct causal
archetypes: tightly coupled, pattern-heterogeneous, and workday-attenuated,
which map pathways from causal diagnosis to intervention. This typology
supports city-to-city learning and lays a foundation for context-sensitive
strategies in sustainable urban and transport planning.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-29 04:12:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Engaging the private sector in contraceptive method supply is critical for
creating equitable, sustainable, and accessible healthcare systems. To achieve
this, it is essential to understand where women obtain their modern
contraceptives. While national-level estimates provide valuable insights into
overall trends in contraceptive supply, they often obscure variation within and
across subnational regions. Addressing localized needs has become increasingly
important as countries adopt decentralized models for family planning services.
Decentralization has also underscored the need for reliable subnational
estimates of key family planning indicators. The absence of regularly collected
subnational data has hindered effective monitoring and decision-making. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent attributes
in Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data to produce Bayesian probabilistic
projections of contraceptive method supply shares (the proportions of modern
contraceptive methods supplied by public and private sectors) with limited
data. Our modeling framework is built on Bayesian hierarchical models. Using
penalized splines to track public and private supply shares over time, we
leverage the spatial nature of the data and incorporate a correlation structure
between recent supply share observations at national and subnational levels.
This framework contributes to the domain of subnational estimation of
proportions in data-sparse settings, outperforming comparable and previous
approaches. As decentralization continues to reshape family planning services,
producing reliable subnational estimates of key indicators is increasingly
vital for researchers and policymakers.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-29 03:00:36</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
manipulation by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), and action decoders
into a unified architecture. However, their deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices, such as mobile robots or embedded systems (e.g., Jetson Orin
Nano), remains challenging due to high computational demands, especially in
real-world scenarios where power, latency, and computational resources are
critical. To close this gap, we introduce Nano-scale Vision-Language Action
(NanoVLA), a family of lightweight VLA architectures that achieve high
performance with minimal resources. Our core innovations include: (1)
vision-language decoupling that moves conventional early vision and language
inputs fusion in VLM to late stage, achieving better performance while enabling
caching and reduce inference overhead and latency; (2) long-short action
chunking to ensure smooth, coherent multi-step planning without sacrificing
real-time responsiveness; (3) dynamic routing that adaptively assigns
lightweight or heavy backbones based on task complexity, further optimizing
inference efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as
real-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster
inference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models,
with 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy
and generalization. Ablation studies confirm that our decoupling strategy
preserves cross-task transferability, and the routing module enhances
cost-performance trade-offs, enabling practical, high-precision robotic
manipulation on resource-constrained hardware.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-29 02:46:55</h6>
<p class='card-text'>With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud services,
data centers have become critical infrastructures driving digital economies,
with increasing energy demand heightening concerns over electricity use and
carbon emissions, emphasizing the need for carbon-aware infrastructure
planning. Most studies assume static power systems, focus only on operational
emissions, and overlook co-optimization. This paper proposes a dynamic joint
planning framework that co-optimizes long-term data center and power system
development over 15 years. The model determines siting, capacity, and type of
data centers alongside power generation expansion, storage deployment, and
retirements, accounting for both operational and embodied emissions. To handle
multi-scale uncertainty, a large-scale two-stage stochastic program is
formulated and solved via an enhanced Benders decomposition. Applied to the PJM
Interconnection, with curated datasets released on GitHub, results show the
system can support up to 55 GW peak data center demand, with Virginia (DOM) and
Northern Illinois (ComEd) as optimal hosts. Compared to non-joint planning, the
framework cuts investment cost by 12.6%, operational cost by 8.25%, and
emissions by 5.63%. Including lifecycle emissions further raises renewable
deployment by 25.5%, highlighting embodied carbon's role in deeper
decarbonization.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Understanding the dynamics of the spread of diseases within populations is
critical for effective public health interventions. We extend the classical SIR
model by incorporating additional complexities such as the introduction of a
cure and migration between cities. Our framework leverages a system of
differential equations to simulate disease transmission across a network of
interconnected cities, capturing more realistic patterns. We present
theoretical results on the convergence of population sizes in the migration
framework (in the absence of deaths). We also run numerical simulations to
understand how the timing of the introduction of the cure affects mortality
rates. Our numerical results explain how localized interventions affect the
spread of the disease across cities. In summary, this work advances the

<p class='card-text'>This paper presents an integrated robotic fused deposition modeling additive
manufacturing system featuring closed-loop thermal control and intelligent
in-situ defect correction using a 6-degree of freedom robotic arm and an Oak-D
camera. The robot arm end effector was modified to mount an E3D hotend
thermally regulated by an IoT microcontroller, enabling precise temperature
control through real-time feedback. Filament extrusion system was synchronized
with robotic motion, coordinated via ROS2, ensuring consistent deposition along
complex trajectories. A vision system based on OpenCV detects layer-wise
defects position, commanding autonomous re-extrusion at identified sites.
Experimental validation demonstrated successful defect mitigation in printing
operations. The integrated system effectively addresses challenges real-time
quality assurance. Inverse kinematics were used for motion planning, while
homography transformations corrected camera perspectives for accurate defect
localization. The intelligent system successfully mitigated surface anomalies
without interrupting the print process. By combining real-time thermal
regulation, motion control, and intelligent defect detection & correction, this
architecture establishes a scalable and adaptive robotic additive manufacturing

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-28 19:02:07</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This study applies an optimized XGBoost regression model to estimate
district-level expenditures on high-dosage tutoring from incomplete
administrative data. The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented learning loss,
with K-12 students losing up to half a grade level in certain subjects. To
address this, the federal government allocated \$190 billion in relief. We know
from previous research that small-group tutoring, summer and after school
programs, and increased support staff were all common expenditures for
districts. We don't know how much was spent in each category. Using a custom
scraped dataset of over 7,000 ESSER (Elementary and Secondary School Emergency
Relief) plans, we model tutoring allocations as a function of district
characteristics such as enrollment, total ESSER funding, urbanicity, and school
count. Extending the trained model to districts that mention tutoring but omit
cost information yields an estimated aggregate allocation of approximately
\$2.2 billion. The model achieved an out-of-sample $R^2$=0.358, demonstrating
moderate predictive accuracy given substantial reporting heterogeneity.
Methodologically, this work illustrates how gradient-boosted decision trees can
reconstruct large-scale fiscal patterns where structured data are sparse or
missing. The framework generalizes to other domains where policy evaluation
depends on recovering latent financial or behavioral variables from
semi-structured text and sparse administrative sources.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We develop a systematic framework for constructing (3+1)-dimensional

finite symmetries, as encountered in gauge theories with fermions or fermionic
lattice systems. Our approach generalizes the Wang-Wen-Witten

recent advances in the study of fermionic TQFTs and related homotopy theory.
The first is the categorical classification of anomalous TQFTs in (3+1)d. The
second, which we develop further in a planned sequel to this paper, is a
hastened Adams spectral sequence for computing supercohomology groups, closely
paralleling techniques from cobordism theory. By integrating supercohomology
and cobordism methods within the recently developed categorical framework of
fusion 2-categories, we provide a concrete and systematic route to constructing
fermionic TQFTs with specified anomalies, thereby establishing a conceptual
bridge between anomaly realization, cobordism, and higher-categorical

<p class='card-text'>Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best
