<p class='card-text'>This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Lei Guo, Jiayang Li</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-16 16:15:59</h6>
<p class='card-text'>As a fundamental problem in transportation and operations research, the
bilevel capacity expansion problem (BCEP) has been extensively studied for
decades. In practice, BCEPs are commonly addressed in two stages: first,
pre-select a small set of links for expansion; then, optimize their capacities.
However, this sequential and separable approach can lead to suboptimal
solutions as it neglects the critical interdependence between link selection
and capacity allocation. In this paper, we propose to introduce a cardinality
constraint into the BCEP to limit the number of expansion locations rather than
fixing such locations beforehand. This allows us to search over all possible
link combinations within the prescribed limit, thereby enabling the joint
optimization of both expansion locations and capacity levels. The resulting
cardinality-constrained BCEP (CCBCEP) is computationally challenging due to the
combination of a nonconvex equilibrium constraint and a nonconvex and
discontinuous cardinality constraint. To address this challenge, we develop a
penalized difference-of-convex (DC) approach that transforms the original
problem into a sequence of tractable subproblems by exploiting its inherent DC
structure and the special properties of the cardinality constraint. We prove
that the method converges to approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solutions
with arbitrarily prescribed accuracy. Numerical experiments further show that
the proposed approach consistently outperforms alternative methods for
identifying practically feasible expansion plans investing only a few links,
both in solution quality and computational efficiency.</p>

high-energy heavy-ion beams are used to mimic the complex mixed radiation field

spearheaded by developments at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, the GSI

a launch in low-Earth orbit and aimed to measure the linear polarization of
solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering
polarimeter. CUSP will allow us to study the magnetic reconnection and particle

  The Compton polarimeter on board CUSP is composed of two acquisition chains

<p class='card-text'>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown significant potential in
robotics due to its high sample efficiency and planning capability. However,
extending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the
complexity of joint dynamics. To address this, we propose the Sequential World
Model (SeqWM), a novel framework that integrates the sequential paradigm into
model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. SeqWM employs independent,
sequentially structured agent-wise world models to decompose complex joint
dynamics. Latent rollouts and decision-making are performed through sequential
communication, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its
actions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design enables
explicit intention sharing, enhancing cooperative performance, and reduces
communication overhead to linear complexity. Results in challenging simulated
environments (Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad) show that SeqWM outperforms existing
state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines in both overall
performance and sample efficiency, while exhibiting advanced cooperative
behaviors such as predictive adaptation and role division. Furthermore, SeqWM
has been success fully deployed on physical quadruped robots, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems. Demos and code are available

<p class='card-text'>We consider the problem of computing aircraft arrival routes in a terminal
maneuvering area (TMA) together with an automated scheduling of all the
arrivals within a given time interval. The arrival routes are modeled as
energy-efficient continuous-descent operations, such that separation based on
wake-turbulence categories is guaranteed within the TMA. We propose a new model
based on a Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation of a previous model for this problem. As
in the previous model, we include tree consistency across consecutive planning
intervals. However, the reformulation enables us to further improve the model
and also consider aircraft that remain in the TMA from the previous period, a
feature critical for operational safety. In computational experiments for
Stockholm Arlanda airport, the new model consistently outperforms the previous
one: we obtain solutions within 5 seconds to 12.65 minutes compared to 40.9
hours with the old model for instances of half hours with high traffic. In
addition, we are able to solve instances of a full hour of arriving aircraft
with high traffic (33 aircraft) within 22.22 to 58.57 minutes, whereas the old
model could not solve these instances at all. While we schedule all aircraft as
continuous-descent arrivals, our model can be applied to any type of speed
profiles for the arriving aircraft.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-16 10:25:46</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Population estimation is crucial for various applications, from resource
allocation to urban planning. Traditional methods such as surveys and censuses
are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources,
requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this
study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high
resolution (0.3 m) satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of 0.5m
resolution and vector boundaries. Proposed method combines Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) architecture for classification task to classify buildings as
residential and non-residential and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
architecture to estimate the population. Approx. 48k building footprints over
Gandhinagar urban area are utilized containing both residential and
non-residential, with residential categories further used for building-level
population estimation. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall
F1-score of 0.9936. The proposed system employs advanced geospatial analysis
with high spatial resolution to estimate Gandhinagar population at 278,954. By
integrating real-time data updates, standardized metrics, and infrastructure
planning capabilities, this automated approach addresses critical limitations
of conventional census-based methodologies. The framework provides
municipalities with a scalable and replicable tool for optimized resource
management in rapidly urbanizing cities, showcasing the efficiency of AI-driven

<p class='card-text'>Inspired by biological systems, we introduce a general framework for
quasi-static shape control of human-scale structures under slowly varying
external actions or requirements. In this setting, shape control aims to
traverse the stable sub-manifolds of the equilibrium set to meet some
predefined requirements or optimization criteria. As finite deformations are
allowed, the equilibrium set may have a non-trivial topology. This paper
explores the implications of large shape changes and high compliance, such as
the emergence of unstable equilibria and equilibrium sets with non-trivial
topology. We identify various adaptivity scenarios, ranging from inverse
kinematics to optimization and path planning problems, and discuss the role of
time-dependent loads and requirements. The applicability of the proposed
concepts is demonstrated through the example of a curved Kirchhoff rod that is
susceptible to snap-through behavior.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Establishing standardized metrics for Social Robot Navigation (SRN)
algorithms for assessing the quality and social compliance of robot behavior
around humans is essential for SRN research. Currently, commonly used
evaluation metrics lack the ability to quantify how cooperative an agent
behaves in interaction with humans. Concretely, in a simple frontal approach
scenario, no metric specifically captures if both agents cooperate or if one
agent stays on collision course and the other agent is forced to evade. To
address this limitation, we propose two new metrics, a conflict intensity
metric and the responsibility metric. Together, these metrics are capable of
evaluating the quality of human-robot interactions by showing how much a given
algorithm has contributed to reducing a conflict and which agent actually took
responsibility of the resolution. This work aims to contribute to the
development of a comprehensive and standardized evaluation methodology for SRN,
ultimately enhancing the safety, efficiency, and social acceptance of robots in
human-centric environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The simultaneous observation of gamma rays and neutrinos from the same
astrophysical source offers a unique opportunity to probe particle acceleration
and interaction mechanisms in ultra-high-energy environments. The Cherenkov
Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray
facility, sensitive to energies from 20~GeV to 300~TeV. In this work, we
present for the first time a performance study of CTAO based on joint
simulations of steady-state sources emitting both neutrinos and gamma rays,
under the assumption that neutrino events are detected by the KM3NeT telescope
in the Northern Hemisphere. To identify potentially observable sources, we
apply a neutrino-based selection filter according to KM3NeT's discovery
potential. We then simulate gamma-ray detectability with CTAO, taking into
account visibility, sensitivity, and extragalactic background light absorption.
The analysis is specifically focused on exploring the detectability of sources
at low neutrino luminosities, limited to values below
$10^{52}\,\mathrm{erg\,yr^{-1}}$, in order to assess the performance of CTAO
and KM3NeT in identifying faint extragalactic emitters. Particular attention is
given to the strategic role of KM3NeT's geographic location, which provides
access to Southern-sky sources, and to the impact of the planned CTA+ upgrade,
which will enhance CTAO-South with Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs). Our results

S-MSP integrates STL constraints within a unified pipeline, trained with a

<p class='card-text'>True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality

<p class='card-text'>Digital Twin (DT) technology enables real-time monitoring and optimization of
complex network infrastructures by creating accurate virtual replicas of
physical systems. In millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G/6G networks, the deployment of
Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) nodes faces highly dynamic urban
environments, necessitating intelligent DT-enabled optimization frameworks.
Traditional IAB deployment optimization approaches struggle with the
combinatorial complexity of jointly optimizing coverage, connectivity, and
resilience, often leading to suboptimal solutions that are vulnerable to
network disruptions. With this consideration, we propose a novel Graph
Attention Network v2 (GATv2)-based reinforcement learning approach for
resilient IAB deployment in urban mmWave networks. Specifically, we formulate
the deployment problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with explicit
resilience constraints and employ edge-conditioned GATv2 to capture complex
spatial dependencies between heterogeneous node types and dynamic connectivity
patterns. The attention mechanism enables the model to focus on critical
deployment locations to maximize coverage and ensure fault tolerance through
redundant backhaul connections. To address the inherent vulnerability of mmWave
links, we train the GATv2 policy using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with
a carefully designed balance between coverage, cost, and resilience.
Comprehensive simulations across three urban scenarios demonstrate that our
method achieves 98.5-98.7 percent coverage with 14.3-26.7 percent fewer nodes
than baseline approaches, while maintaining 87.1 percent coverage retention
under 30 percent link failures, representing 11.3-15.4 percent improvement in
fault tolerance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Network planning seeks to determine base station parameters that maximize
coverage and capacity in cellular networks. However, achieving optimal planning
remains challenging due to the diversity of deployment scenarios and the
significant simulation-to-reality discrepancy. In this paper, we propose
\emph{AutoPlan}, a new automatic network planning framework by leveraging
digital radio twin (DRT) techniques. We derive the DRT by finetuning the
parameters of building materials to reduce the sim-to-real discrepancy based on
crowdsource real-world user data. Leveraging the DRT, we design a Bayesian
optimization based algorithm to optimize the deployment parameters of base
stations efficiently. Using the field measurement from Husker-Net, we
extensively evaluate \emph{AutoPlan} under various deployment scenarios, in
terms of both coverage and capacity. The evaluation results show that
\emph{AutoPlan} flexibly adapts to different scenarios and achieves performance
comparable to exhaustive search, while requiring less than 2\% of its
computation time.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In a coherent reliability system composed of multiple components configured
according to a specific structure function, the distribution of system time to
failure, or system lifetime, is often of primary interest. Accurate estimation
of system reliability is critical in a wide range of engineering and industrial
applications, forming decisions in system design, maintenance planning, and
risk assessment. The system lifetime distribution can be estimated directly
using the observed system failure times. However, when component-level lifetime
data is available, it can yield improved estimates of system reliability. In
this work, we demonstrate that under nonparametric assumptions about the
component time-to-failure distributions, traditional estimators such as the
Product-Limit Estimator (PLE) can be further improved under specific loss
functions. We propose a novel methodology that enhances the nonparametric
system reliability estimation through a shrinkage transformation applied to
component-level estimators. This shrinkage approach leads to improved
efficiency in estimating system reliability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Mitigation of the threat from airbursting asteroids requires an understanding
of the potential risk they pose for the ground. How asteroids release their
kinetic energy in the atmosphere is not well understood due to the rarity of
significant impacts. Ordinary chondrites, in particular L chondrites, represent
a frequent type of Earth-impacting asteroids. Here, we present the first
comprehensive, space-to-lab characterization of an L chondrite impact. Small
asteroid 2023 CX1 was detected in space and predicted to impact over Normandy,
France, on 13 February 2023. Observations from multiple independent sensors and
reduction techniques revealed an unusual but potentially high-risk
fragmentation behavior. The nearly spherical 650 $\pm$ 160 kg (72 $\pm$ 6 cm
diameter) asteroid catastrophically fragmented around 28 km altitude, releasing
98% of its total energy in a concentrated region of the atmosphere. The
resulting shockwave was spherical, not cylindrical, and released more energy
closer to the ground. This type of fragmentation increases the risk of
significant damage at ground level. These results warrant consideration for a
planetary defense strategy for cases where a >3-4 MPa dynamic pressure is
expected, including planning for evacuation of areas beneath anticipated
disruption locations.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper presents data-driven approaches for integrated assortment planning
and inventory allocation that significantly improve fulfillment efficiency at
JD.com, a leading E-commerce company. JD.com uses a two-level distribution
network that includes regional distribution centers (RDCs) and front
distribution centers (FDCs). Selecting products to stock at FDCs and then
optimizing daily inventory allocation from RDCs to FDCs is critical to
improving fulfillment efficiency, which is crucial for enhancing customer
experiences. For assortment planning, we propose efficient algorithms to
maximize the number of orders that can be fulfilled by FDCs (local
fulfillment). For inventory allocation, we develop a novel end-to-end algorithm
that integrates forecasting, optimization, and simulation to minimize lost
sales and inventory transfer costs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our
methods outperform existing approaches, increasing local order fulfillment
rates by 0.54% and our inventory allocation algorithm increases FDC demand
satisfaction rates by 1.05%. Considering the high-volume operations of JD.com,
with millions of weekly orders per region, these improvements yield substantial
benefits beyond the company's established supply chain system. Implementation
across JD.com's network has reduced costs, improved stock availability, and
increased local order fulfillment rates for millions of orders annually.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Engineering models created in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
environments contain detailed information about system structure and behavior.
However, they typically lack symbolic planning semantics such as preconditions,
effects, and constraints related to resource availability and timing. This
limits their ability to evaluate whether a given system variant can fulfill
specific tasks and how efficiently it performs compared to alternatives.
  To address this gap, this paper presents a model-driven method that enables
the specification and automated generation of symbolic planning artifacts
within SysML-based engineering models. A dedicated SysML profile introduces
reusable stereotypes for core planning constructs. These are integrated into
existing model structures and processed by an algorithm that generates a valid
domain file and a corresponding problem file in Planning Domain Definition
Language (PDDL). In contrast to previous approaches that rely on manual
transformations or external capability models, the method supports native
integration and maintains consistency between engineering and planning
artifacts.
  The applicability of the method is demonstrated through a case study from
aircraft assembly. The example illustrates how existing engineering models are
enriched with planning semantics and how the proposed workflow is applied to
generate consistent planning artifacts from these models. The generated
planning artifacts enable the validation of system variants through AI
planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a widely used 3D imaging technique in
dentistry, providing volumetric information about the anatomical structures of
jaws and teeth. Accurate segmentation of these anatomies is critical for
clinical applications such as diagnosis and surgical planning, but remains
time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we present U-Mamba2, a new
neural network architecture designed for multi-anatomy CBCT segmentation in the
context of the ToothFairy3 challenge. U-Mamba2 integrates the Mamba2 state
space models into the U-Net architecture, enforcing stronger structural
constraints for higher efficiency without compromising performance. In
addition, we integrate interactive click prompts with cross-attention blocks,
pre-train U-Mamba2 using self-supervised learning, and incorporate dental
domain knowledge into the model design to address key challenges of dental
anatomy segmentation in CBCT. Extensive experiments, including independent
tests, demonstrate that U-Mamba2 is both effective and efficient, securing top
3 places in both tasks of the Toothfairy3 challenge. In Task 1, U-Mamba2
achieved a mean Dice of 0.792, HD95 of 93.19 with the held-out test data, with
an average inference time of XX (TBC during the ODIN workshop). In Task 2,
U-Mamba2 achieved the mean Dice of 0.852 and HD95 of 7.39 with the held-out

<p class='card-text'>The fine-grained surface reconstruction of different organs from 3D medical
imaging can provide advanced diagnostic support and improved surgical planning.
However, the representation of the organs is often limited by the resolution,
with a detailed higher resolution requiring more memory and computing
footprint. Implicit representations of objects have been proposed to alleviate
this problem in general computer vision by providing compact and differentiable
functions to represent the 3D object shapes. However, architectural and
data-related differences prevent the direct application of these methods to
medical images. This work introduces ImplMORe, an end-to-end deep learning
method using implicit surface representations for multi-organ reconstruction
from 3D medical images. ImplMORe incorporates local features using a 3D CNN
encoder and performs multi-scale interpolation to learn the features in the
continuous domain using occupancy functions. We apply our method for single and
multiple organ reconstructions using the totalsegmentator dataset. By
leveraging the continuous nature of occupancy functions, our approach
outperforms the discrete explicit representation based surface reconstruction
approaches, providing fine-grained surface details of the organ at a resolution
higher than the given input image. The source code will be made publicly

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-15 14:53:54</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We study the problem of generalizing an expert agent's behavior, provided
through demonstrations, to new environments and/or additional constraints.
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) offers a promising solution by seeking to
recover the expert's underlying reward function, which, if used for planning in
the new settings, would reproduce the desired behavior. However, IRL is
inherently ill-posed: multiple reward functions, forming the so-called feasible
set, can explain the same observed behavior. Since these rewards may induce
different policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional
information, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy.
In this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the
"average" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset
of the feasible set. Remarkably, we show that this policy can be obtained by
planning with the reward centroid of that subset, for which we derive a
closed-form expression. We then present a provably efficient algorithm for
estimating this centroid using an offline dataset of expert demonstrations
only. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations that illustrate the
relationship between the expert's behavior and the behavior produced by our
method.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Diffusion-based planners have gained significant recent attention for their
robustness and performance in long-horizon tasks. However, most existing
planners rely on a fixed, pre-specified horizon during both training and
inference. This rigidity often produces length-mismatch (trajectories that are
too short or too long) and brittle performance across instances with varying
geometric or dynamical difficulty. In this paper, we introduce the Variable
Horizon Diffuser (VHD) framework, which treats the horizon as a learned
variable rather than a fixed hyperparameter. Given a start-goal pair, we first
predict an instance-specific horizon using a learned Length Predictor model,
which guides a Diffusion Planner to generate a trajectory of the desired
length. Our design maintains compatibility with existing diffusion planners by
controlling trajectory length through initial noise shaping and training on
randomly cropped sub-trajectories, without requiring architectural changes.
Empirically, VHD improves success rates and path efficiency in maze-navigation
and robot-arm control benchmarks, showing greater robustness to horizon
mismatch and unseen lengths, while keeping training simple and offline-only.</p>

employs the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform, MODWT with four wavelet
families such as, Haar, Daubechies, Symlet, Coiflet etc. to achieve shift
invariant, multiresolution decomposition of the rainfall series. Linear and
seasonal components are modeled using Seasonal ARIMA, SARIMA, while nonlinear
components are modeled by a Transformer network, and forecasts are
reconstructed via inverse MODWT. Comprehensive validation using an 80 is to 20
train test split and multiple performance indices such as, RMSE, MAE, SMAPE,
Willmotts d, Skill Score, Percent Bias, Explained Variance, and Legates McCabes
E1 demonstrates the superiority of the Haar-based hybrid model, WHST. Across
all subdivisions, WHST consistently achieved lower forecast errors, stronger
agreement with observed rainfall, and unbiased predictions compared with stand
alone SARIMA, stand-alone Transformer, and two-stage wavelet hybrids. Residual
adequacy was confirmed through the Ljung Box test, while Taylor diagrams
provided an integrated assessment of correlation, variance fidelity, and RMSE,
further reinforcing the robustness of the proposed approach. The results
highlight the effectiveness of integrating multiresolution signal decomposition
with complementary linear and deep learning models for hydroclimatic

isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and
surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no
technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that
the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation
