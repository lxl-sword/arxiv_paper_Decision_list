<p class='card-text'>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their
development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks
often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with
incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect
real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal
evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each
component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880
pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4
document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data
contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence
pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.
Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4
MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text
and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building
stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the
over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to
provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source
Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced
document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new
benchmarks on an annual basis.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is an advanced cancer treatment
modality that offers significant advantages over conventional X-ray therapies,
particularly in its ability to minimize radiation dose beyond the tumor target.
This reduction in unnecessary irradiation exposure significantly lowers the
risk to surrounding healthy tissue and reduces side effects compared to
conventional X-ray treatments. However, due to the high complexity of IMPT
plans, each plan must be independently validated to ensure the safety and
efficacy of the radiation exposure to the patient. While ion chambers are
currently used for this purpose, their limitations-particularly in angled-beam
measurements and multi-depth assessments-hinder their effectiveness.
Silicon-based detectors, commonly used in X-ray therapy, are unsuitable for
IMPT due to their rapid degradation under proton irradiation. In this study, a
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) detector was
evaluated and compared with a commercial ion chamber using a MEVION S250i
proton accelerator. The $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ detector demonstrated reliable
detection of single-pulse proton doses as low as 0.26 MU and exhibited a linear
charge-to-dose relationship across a wide range of irradiation conditions.
Furthermore, its measurement variability was comparable to that of the ion
chamber, with improved sensitivity observed at higher bias voltages. These
results highlight the strong potential of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ as a
radiation-hard detector material for accurate dose verification in IMPT.</p>

<p class='card-text'>A central research topic in robotics is how to use this system to interact
with the physical world. Traditional manipulation tasks primarily focus on
small objects. However, in factory or home environments, there is often a need
for the movement of large objects, such as moving tables. These tasks typically
require multi-robot systems to work collaboratively. Previous research lacks a
framework that can scale to arbitrary sizes of robots and generalize to various
kinds of tasks. In this work, we propose CollaBot, a generalist framework for
simultaneous collaborative manipulation. First, we use SEEM for scene
segmentation and point cloud extraction of the target object. Then, we propose
a collaborative grasping framework, which decomposes the task into local grasp
pose generation and global collaboration. Finally, we design a 2-stage planning
module that can generate collision-free trajectories to achieve this task.
Experiments show a success rate of 52% across different numbers of robots,
objects, and tasks, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

  Transfers with Poliastro Simulation</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-05 14:03:35</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Orbital maneuver planning is a critical aspect of mission design, aimed at
minimizing propellant consumption, which is directly correlated with the total
velocity change ($\Delta V$). While analytical solutions like the Hohmann and
Bi-elliptic transfers offer optimal strategies for specific cases, they lack
the flexibility for more general optimization problems. This paper presents a
computational framework that couples a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the
Poliastro orbital mechanics library to autonomously discover fuel-optimal,
three-impulse transfer trajectories between coplanar circular orbits. We
validate this framework across two distinct scenarios: a low-energy transfer
from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to a Geostationary Orbit (GEO), and a high-energy
transfer to a distant orbit with a radius 20 times that of LEO. Our results
demonstrate the framework's remarkable adaptability. For the LEO-to-GEO
transfer, the GA precisely converges to the classical Hohmann transfer,
achieving an identical $\Delta V$ of 3853.96 m/s and validating the method's
accuracy. Conversely, for the high-energy transfer, the GA identifies a
superior Bi-elliptic trajectory that yields a significant $\Delta V$ saving of
213.47 m/s compared to the Hohmann transfer. This fuel efficiency, however,
necessitates a trade-off, extending the mission duration from approximately 1
day to over 140 years. This work demonstrates an accessible and powerful
toolchain for the rapid prototyping of optimal trajectories, showcasing how
combining evolutionary algorithms with open-source libraries provides a robust
method for solving complex astrodynamics problems and quantifying their
critical design trade-offs.</p>

  Video-Based Polyp Detection</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Zilin Chen, Shengnan Lu</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-05 13:59:18</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

<p class='card-text'>The KAGRA Collaboration has investigated a ten-year upgrade strategy for the
KAGRA gravitational wave detector, considering a total of 14 upgrade options
that vary in mirror mass, quantum noise reduction techniques, and the quality
of cryogenic suspensions. We evaluated the scientific potential of these
configurations with a focus on key targets such as parameter estimation of
compact binary coalescences, binary neutron star post-merger signals, and
continuous gravitational waves. Rather than aiming to improve all science cases
uniformly, we prioritized those most sensitive to the detector configuration.
Technical feasibility was assessed based on required hardware developments,
associated R\&D efforts, cost, and risk. Our study finds that a high-frequency
upgrade plan that enhances sensitivity over a broad frequency range above ~200
Hz offers the best balance between scientific return and technical feasibility.
Such an upgrade would enable sky localization of binary neutron star mergers at
100 Mpc to better than 0.5 deg$^2$ in a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network, and improve
the measurement precision of tidal deformability parameter by approximately 10%
at median, compared to a network without KAGRA.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated

<p class='card-text'>Embodied Planning is dedicated to the goal of creating agents capable of
executing long-horizon tasks in complex physical worlds. However, existing
embodied planning benchmarks frequently feature short-horizon tasks and
coarse-grained action primitives. To address this challenge, we introduce
CookBench, a benchmark for long-horizon planning in complex cooking scenarios.
By leveraging a high-fidelity simulation environment built upon the powerful
Unity game engine, we define frontier AI challenges in a complex, realistic
environment. The core task in CookBench is designed as a two-stage process.
First, in Intention Recognition, an agent needs to accurately parse a user's
complex intent. Second, in Embodied Interaction, the agent should execute the
identified cooking goal through a long-horizon, fine-grained sequence of
physical actions. Unlike existing embodied planning benchmarks, we refine the
action granularity to a spatial level that considers crucial operational
information while abstracting away low-level robotic control. Besides, We
provide a comprehensive toolset that encapsulates the simulator. Its unified
API supports both macro-level operations, such as placing orders and purchasing
ingredients, and a rich set of fine-grained embodied actions for physical
interaction, enabling researchers to focus on high-level planning and
decision-making. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of
state-of-the-art, closed-source Large Language Model and Vision-Language Model,
revealing their major shortcomings and challenges posed by complex,
long-horizon tasks. The full benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate

<p class='card-text'>Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-05 06:35:37</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Robots operating in human-centric or hazardous environments must proactively
anticipate and mitigate dangers beyond basic obstacle detection. Traditional
navigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for
dynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a
result, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when
handling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language
models and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive
hazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping
framework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential
dynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling
robots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this
language-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only
identifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around
potential hazards arising from environmental dynamics. Experiments in simulated
and diverse dynamic environments demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly improves navigation success rates and reduces hazard encounters,
compared to reactive baseline planners. Code and supplementary materials are

<p class='card-text'>A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route
maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch
map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an
agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch
map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale
dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71
indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying
levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their
preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future
research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline
that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve
SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual
observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a
Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature
representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To
improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor
(DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site
constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide
navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a
large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105%
relatively. Our code and dataset will be released.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Path planning in unknown environments is a crucial yet inherently challenging
capability for mobile robots, which primarily encompasses two coupled tasks:
autonomous exploration and point-goal navigation. In both cases, the robot must
perceive the environment, update its belief, and accurately estimate potential
information gain on-the-fly to guide planning. In this work, we propose
CogniPlan, a novel path planning framework that leverages multiple plausible
layouts predicted by a COnditional GeNerative Inpainting model, mirroring how
humans rely on cognitive maps during navigation. These predictions, based on
the partially observed map and a set of layout conditioning vectors, enable our
planner to reason effectively under uncertainty. We demonstrate strong synergy
between generative image-based layout prediction and graph-attention-based path
planning, allowing CogniPlan to combine the scalability of graph
representations with the fidelity and predictiveness of occupancy maps,
yielding notable performance gains in both exploration and navigation. We
extensively evaluate CogniPlan on two datasets (hundreds of maps and realistic
floor plans), consistently outperforming state-of-the-art planners. We further
deploy it in a high-fidelity simulator and on hardware, showcasing its
high-quality path planning and real-world applicability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multimodal medical image fusion integrates complementary information from
different imaging modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment
planning. While deep learning methods have advanced performance, existing
approaches face critical limitations: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
excel at local feature extraction but struggle to model global context
effectively, while Transformers achieve superior long-range modeling at the
cost of quadratic computational complexity, limiting clinical deployment.
Recent State Space Models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling
efficient long-range dependency modeling in linear time through selective scan
mechanisms. Despite these advances, the extension to 3D volumetric data and the
clinical validation of fused images remains underexplored. In this work, we
propose ClinicalFMamba, a novel end-to-end CNN-Mamba hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines local and global feature modeling for 2D and 3D
images. We further design a tri-plane scanning strategy for effectively
learning volumetric dependencies in 3D images. Comprehensive evaluations on
three datasets demonstrate the superior fusion performance across multiple
quantitative metrics while achieving real-time fusion. We further validate the
clinical utility of our approach on downstream 2D/3D brain tumor classification
tasks, achieving superior performance over baseline methods. Our method
establishes a new paradigm for efficient multimodal medical image fusion
suitable for real-time clinical deployment.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Rising electricity demand underscores the need for secure and reliable
generation expansion planning that accounts for upstream supply chain
constraints. Traditional models often overlook limitations in materials,
manufacturing capacity, lead times for deployment, and field availability,
which can delay availability of planned resources and thus to threaten system
reliability. This paper introduces a multi-stage supply chain-constrained
generation expansion planning (SC-GEP) model that optimizes long-term
investments while capturing material availability, production limits, spatial
and temporal constraints, and material reuse from retired assets. A
decomposition algorithm efficiently solves the resulting MILP. A Maryland case
study shows that supply chain constraints shift technology choices, amplify
deployment delays caused by lead times, and prompt earlier investment in
shorter lead-time, low-material-intensity options. In the low-demand scenario,
supply chain constraints raise investment costs by $1.2 billion. Under high
demand, persistent generation and reserve shortfalls emerge, underscoring the
need to integrate upstream constraints into long-term planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Object manipulation skills are necessary for robots operating in various
daily-life scenarios, ranging from warehouses to hospitals. They allow the
robots to manipulate the given object to their desired arrangement in the
cluttered environment. The existing approaches to solving object manipulations
are either inefficient sampling based techniques, require expert
demonstrations, or learn by trial and error, making them less ideal for
practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel, multimodal
physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving object manipulation tasks.
Our approach efficiently learns to solve the Eikonal equation without expert
data and finds object manipulation trajectories fast in complex, cluttered
environments. Our method is multimodal as it also reactively replans the
robot's grasps during manipulation to achieve the desired object poses. We
demonstrate our approach in both simulation and real-world scenarios and
compare it against state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results indicate that
our approach is effective across various objects, has efficient training
compared to previous learning-based methods, and demonstrates high performance

<p class='card-text'>Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials
design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet
they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into
their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system
capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle,
from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We
introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic
materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and
executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results,
and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives.
SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research
gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps,
including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization,
embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is
evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and
perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of
SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the
user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter
consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific
rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world
design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate
SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically

<p class='card-text'>Contact-rich problems, such as snake robot locomotion, offer unexplored yet
rich opportunities for optimization-based trajectory and acyclic contact
planning. So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on
emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns
using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or
focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However,
models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are
based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the
challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain
absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations
and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order
model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion

<p class='card-text'>Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and

interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment
requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics
often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking
interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded
Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework
leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated
report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement
on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as
interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to
question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment.
Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment

<p class='card-text'>Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of

equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,

<p class='card-text'>Manipulating matter with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) enables
creation of atomically defined artificial structures that host designer quantum
states. However, the time-consuming nature of the manipulation process, coupled
with the sensitivity of the STM tip, constrains the exploration of diverse
configurations and limits the size of designed features. In this study, we
present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for creating artificial
structures by spatially manipulating carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on a copper
substrate using the STM tip. The automated workflow combines molecule detection
and manipulation, employing deep learning-based object detection to locate CO
molecules and linear assignment algorithms to allocate these molecules to
designated target sites. We initially perform molecule maneuvering based on
randomized parameter sampling for sample bias, tunneling current setpoint and
manipulation speed. This dataset is then structured into an action trajectory
used to train an RL agent. The model is subsequently deployed on the STM for
real-time fine-tuning of manipulation parameters during structure construction.
Our approach incorporates path planning protocols coupled with active drift
compensation to enable atomically precise fabrication of structures with
significantly reduced human input while realizing larger-scale artificial
lattices with desired electronic properties. To underpin of efficiency of our
approach we demonstrate the automated construction of an extended artificial

<p class='card-text'>Accurate whole-heart segmentation is a critical component in the precise
diagnosis and interventional planning of cardiovascular diseases. Integrating
complementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation
accuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods
face several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities
hinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack
adaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are
decoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a
dual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature
alignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal
3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network
to process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign
module between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention
mechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a
reinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that
consistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features
are then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an
ensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from
individual patches to produce the final segmentation result. Experimental
results on the publicly available MM-WHS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the
proposed RL-U$^2$Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving
Dice coefficients of 93.1% on CT and 87.0% on MRI, thereby validating the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.</p>
