<p class='card-text'>Planning in environments with moving obstacles remains a significant
challenge in robotics. While many works focus on navigation and path planning
in obstacle-dense spaces, traversing such congested regions is often avoidable
by selecting alternative routes. This paper presents Traversability-aware FMM
(Tr-FMM), a path planning method that computes paths in dynamic environments,
avoiding crowded regions. The method operates in two steps: first, it
discretizes the environment, identifying regions and their distribution;
second, it computes the traversability of regions, aiming to minimize both
obstacle risks and goal deviation. The path is then computed by propagating the
wavefront through regions with higher traversability. Simulated and real-world
experiments demonstrate that the approach enhances significant safety by
keeping the robot away from regions with obstacles while reducing unnecessary
deviations from the goal.</p>

  Vulnerable Communities</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Mahmuda Akhter Nishu, Chenyu Huang, Milad Roohi, Xin Zhong</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-20 15:46:02</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Wind hazards such as tornadoes and straight-line winds frequently affect
vulnerable communities in the Great Plains of the United States, where limited
infrastructure and sparse data coverage hinder effective emergency response.
Existing forecasting systems focus primarily on meteorological elements and
often fail to capture community-specific vulnerabilities, limiting their
utility for localized risk assessment and resilience planning. To address this
gap, we propose an interpretable dual-stream learning framework that integrates
structured numerical weather data with unstructured textual event narratives.
Our architecture combines a Random Forest and RoBERTa-based transformer through
a late fusion mechanism, enabling robust and context-aware wind hazard
prediction. The system is tailored for underserved tribal communities and
supports block-level risk assessment. Experimental results show significant
performance gains over traditional baselines. Furthermore, gradient-based
sensitivity and ablation studies provide insight into the model's
decision-making process, enhancing transparency and operational trust. The
findings demonstrate both predictive effectiveness and practical value in
supporting emergency preparedness and advancing community resilience.</p>

  planning in radiotherapy</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-20 15:35:49</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Background: Deep learning has potential to improve the efficiency and
consistency of radiation therapy planning, but clinical adoption is hindered by
the limited model generalizability due to data scarcity and heterogeneity among
institutions. Although aggregating data from different institutions could
alleviate this problem, data sharing is a practical challenge due to concerns
about patient data privacy and other technical obstacles. Purpose: This work
aims to address this dilemma by developing FedKBP+, a comprehensive federated
learning (FL) platform for predictive tasks in real-world applications in
radiotherapy treatment planning. Methods: We implemented a unified
communication stack based on Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) to support
communication between participants whether located on the same workstation or
distributed across multiple workstations. In addition to supporting the
centralized FL strategies commonly available in existing open-source
frameworks, FedKBP+ also provides a fully decentralized FL model where
participants directly exchange model weights to each other through Peer-to-Peer
communication. We evaluated FedKBP+ on three predictive tasks using
scale-attention network (SA-Net) as the predictive model. Conclusions: Our
results demonstrate that FedKBP+ is highly effective, efficient and robust,
showing great potential as a federated learning platform for radiation therapy.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-20 15:14:47</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In the field of urban planning, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
frequently fail to effectively analyze and evaluate planning maps, despite the
critical importance of these visual elements for urban planners and related
educational contexts. Planning maps, which visualize land use, infrastructure
layouts, and functional zoning, require specialized understanding of spatial
configurations, regulatory requirements, and multi-scale analysis. To address
this challenge, we introduce PlanGPT-VL, the first domain-specific
Vision-Language Model tailored specifically for urban planning maps. PlanGPT-VL
employs three innovative approaches: (1) PlanAnno-V framework for high-quality
VQA data synthesis, (2) Critical Point Thinking to reduce hallucinations
through structured verification, and (3) comprehensive training methodology
combining Supervised Fine-Tuning with frozen vision encoder parameters. Through
systematic evaluation on our proposed PlanBench-V benchmark, we demonstrate
that PlanGPT-VL significantly outperforms general-purpose state-of-the-art VLMs
in specialized planning map interpretation tasks, offering urban planning
professionals a reliable tool for map analysis, assessment, and educational
applications while maintaining high factual accuracy. Our lightweight 7B
parameter model achieves comparable performance to models exceeding 72B
parameters, demonstrating efficient domain specialization without sacrificing
performance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The long term consequences of unwanted pregnancies carried to term on mothers
have not been much explored. We use data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study
(WLS) and propose a novel approach, namely two team cross-screening, to study
the possible effects of unwanted pregnancies carried to term on various aspects
of mothers' later-life mental health, physical health, economic well-being and
life satisfaction. Our method, unlike existing approaches to observational
studies, enables the investigators to perform exploratory data analysis,
confirmatory data analysis and replication in the same study. This is a
valuable property when there is only a single data set available with unique
strengths to perform exploratory, confirmatory and replication analysis. In two
team cross-screening, the investigators split themselves into two teams and the
data is split as well according to a meaningful covariate. Each team then
performs exploratory data analysis on its part of the data to design an
analysis plan for the other part of the data. The complete freedom of the teams
in designing the analysis has the potential to generate new unanticipated
hypotheses in addition to a prefixed set of hypotheses. Moreover, only the
hypotheses that looked promising in the data each team explored are forwarded
for analysis (thus alleviating the multiple testing problem). These advantages
are demonstrated in our study of the effects of unwanted pregnancies on
mothers' later life outcomes.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-20 14:45:16</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper introduces a novel semantics-aware inspection planning policy
derived through deep reinforcement learning. Reflecting the fact that within
autonomous informative path planning missions in unknown environments, it is
often only a sparse set of objects of interest that need to be inspected, the
method contributes an end-to-end policy that simultaneously performs semantic
object visual inspection combined with collision-free navigation. Assuming
access only to the instantaneous depth map, the associated segmentation image,
the ego-centric local occupancy, and the history of past positions in the
robot's neighborhood, the method demonstrates robust generalizability and
successful crossing of the sim2real gap. Beyond simulations and extensive
comparison studies, the approach is verified in experimental evaluations
onboard a flying robot deployed in novel environments with previously unseen
semantics and overall geometric configurations.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Visual-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (VI-CoT) enables MLLMs to continually
update their understanding and decisions based on step-wise intermediate visual
states (IVS), much like a human would, which demonstrates impressive success in
various tasks, thereby leading to emerged advancements in related benchmarks.
Despite promising progress, current benchmarks provide models with relatively
fixed IVS, rather than free-style IVS, whch might forcibly distort the original
thinking trajectories, failing to evaluate their intrinsic reasoning
capabilities. More importantly, existing benchmarks neglect to systematically
explore the impact factors that IVS would impart to untamed reasoning
performance. To tackle above gaps, we introduce a specialized benchmark termed
ViC-Bench, consisting of four representive tasks: maze navigation, jigsaw
puzzle, embodied long-horizon planning, and complex counting, where each task
has dedicated free-style IVS generation pipeline supporting function calls. To
systematically examine VI-CoT capability, we propose a thorough evaluation
suite incorporating a progressive three-stage strategy with targeted new
metrics. Besides, we establish Incremental Prompting Information Injection
(IPII) strategy to ablatively explore the prompting factors for VI-CoT. We
extensively conduct evaluations for 18 advanced MLLMs, revealing key insights
into their VI-CoT capability. Our proposed benchmark is publicly open at

  NewAthena/X-IFU and simulation based inference to constrain turbulence</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Alexeï Molin, Simon Dupourqué, Nicolas Clerc, Étienne Pointecouteau, François Pajot, Edoardo Cucchetti</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-20 14:01:38</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Context. The NewAthena mission planned for launch in the mid-2030s will carry
X-IFU, an integral field unit spectrometer that will enable unique insight in
the X-ray hot universe through its combination of spectral and spatial
capabilities. The high spectral resolution will allow a mapping of turbulent
velocities of the hot gas in galaxy clusters, providing an unrivaled way to
study the complex dynamics within galaxy clusters.
  Aims. This is the fourth in a series of papers aimed at forecasting the
ability to investigate turbulence in the intracluster medium through the
observation of the centroid shift caused by turbulent motions of the gas. In
this paper we improve on previous methods by investigating the ability of
simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the underlying nature of velocity
fluctuations through the use of standard observational diagnostics, such as the
structure function.
  Methods. We rely on a complex architecture of neural networks in order to
model the likelihood and posterior distributions relevant to our case. We
investigate its capability to retrieve the turbulence parameters on mock
observations, and explore its capability to use alternative summary statistics.
  Conclusions. Our trained models are able to infer the parameters of the
intracluster gas velocity power-spectrum in independently simulated X-IFU
observations of a galaxy cluster. We evaluated the precision of the recovery
for different models. We show the necessity to use methods such as SBI to avoid
an under-estimation of the sources of variance by comparing the results to our
previous paper. We confirm that sample variance severely impacts the precision
of recovered turbulent features. Our results demonstrate the need for advanced
modeling methods to tackle the complexity of the physical information nested
within future observations expected from X-IFU/NewAthena.</p>

purpose and challenges, and act accordingly. The MPA used Generative AI to
support personalized and actionable prospective reflection across the diversity

of a global technology company reflected with the MPA on upcoming meetings.
Observed impacts were: clarifying meeting purposes, challenges, and success

<p class='card-text'>Path planning is crucial for the navigation of autonomous vehicles, yet these
vehicles face challenges in complex and real-world environments. Although a
global view may be provided, it is often outdated, necessitating the reliance
of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) on real-time local information. This
reliance on partial information, without considering the global context, can
lead to UGVs getting stuck in local minima. This paper develops a method to
proactively predict local minima using Dynamic Bayesian filtering, based on the

enhance the autonomous navigation of self-driving vehicles by allowing them to
predict potential pitfalls before they get stuck, and either ask for help from

<p class='card-text'>Since its approval in 2016, NA64 has pioneered light dark matter (LDM)
searches with electron, positron, muon, and hadron beams. The experiment has
successfully met its primary objectives, as outlined in the EPPS input (2018),
and even exceeded them, producing results that demonstrate its ability to
operate in a near-background-free environment. The Physics Beyond Collider
(PBC) initiative at CERN recognizes NA64's contributions as complementary and
worthy of continued exploration. Its key advantage over beam-dump approaches is
that the signal rate scales as the square of the coupling rather than the
fourth power, reducing the required number of beam particles for the same
sensitivity.
  To fully exploit the NA64 physics potential, an upgrade during LS3 will
enable the experiment to run in background-free mode at higher SPS beam rates.
Planned upgrades include: (a) improved detector hermeticity with a new veto
hadron calorimeter, (b) enhanced particle identification with a synchrotron
radiation detector, and (c) increased beam rates via upgraded electronics.
  With the recently strengthened NA64 collaboration, stable operations and
timely data analysis are planned for LHC Run 4. The expected beam exposures are
approximately 1e13 electrons, 1e11 positrons (at 40 and 60 GeV), and 2e13 muons
on target. This will allow NA64 to explore new LDM parameter space, with the
potential for discovery or conclusive exclusion of many well-motivated models.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper introduces a data-driven (i.e., model-free) approach to identify
which inverter-based resources (IBRs) have dominant participation in poorly
damped sub-synchronous oscillations (SSO), to get to the root cause for
effective mitigation. An Enhanced Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) method is
proposed that incorporates an appropriate set of observables. Based on
time-synchronized data (either simulated or real) from IBR connection points,
eDMD directly computes data-driven eigenvectors and participation factors to
reveal the role of each IBR in poorly damped SSO. We show the improved accuracy
of eDMD over conventional Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) by benchmarking both
against actual model-based analysis. We demonstrate this first through a
synthetic example and then a case study on the IEEE 39-bus test system with
100% IBR. This data-driven, model-free method offers a powerful tool to foresee

<p class='card-text'>Since the standardization of IPv6 in 1998, both versions of the Internet
Protocol have coexisted in the Internet. Clients usually run algorithms such as
Happy Eyeballs, to decide whether to connect to an IPv4 or IPv6 endpoint for
dual-stack domains. To identify whether two addresses belong to the same device
or service, researchers have proposed different forms of alias resolution
techniques. Similarly, one can also form siblings of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
belonging to the same device. Traditionally, all of these approaches have
focused on individual IP addresses.
  In this work, we propose the concept of "sibling prefixes", where we extend
the definition of an IPv4-IPv6 sibling to two IP prefixe-one IPv4 prefix and
its sibling IPv6 prefix. We present a technique based on large-scale DNS
resolution data to identify 76k IPv4-IPv6 sibling prefixes. We find sibling
prefixes to be relatively stable over time. We present SP-Tuner algorithm to
tune the CIDR size of sibling prefixes and improve the perfect match siblings
from 52% to 82%. For more than half of sibling prefixes, the organization names
for their IPv4 and IPv6 origin ASes are identical, and 60% of all sibling
prefixes have at least one of the prefixes with a valid ROV status in RPKI.
Furthermore, we identify sibling prefixes in 24 hypergiant and CDN networks.
Finally, we plan to regularly publish a list of sibling prefixes to be used by
network operators and fellow researchers in dual-stack studies.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Delays in public transport are common, often impacting users through
prolonged travel times and missed transfers. Existing solutions for handling
delays remain limited; backup plans based on historical data miss opportunities
for earlier arrivals, while snapshot planning accounts for current delays but
not future ones. With the growing availability of live delay data, users can
adjust their journeys in real-time. However, the literature lacks a framework
that fully exploits this advantage for system-scale dynamic replanning. To
address this, we formalise the dynamic replanning problem in public transport
routing and propose two solutions: a "pull" approach, where users manually
request replanning, and a novel "push" approach, where the server proactively
monitors and adjusts journeys. Our experiments show that the push approach
outperforms the pull approach, achieving significant speedups. The results also

<p class='card-text'>African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease that poses a
significant threat to the swine industry, requiring stringent control measures,
including movement restrictions that delay pig placements, impacting business
continuity. The number and economic impact of unplaced healthy animals due to
control zone restrictions remains unmeasured. This study evaluates the economic
and epidemiological impacts of control zone placement restrictions during
simulated ASF outbreaks in U.S. commercial swine farms. We model the spread of
ASF and apply the U.S. National Response Plan (NRP) alongside alternative
mitigation strategies, analyzing key metrics such as the number of unplaced
pigs, depopulated pigs, infected farms, and total economic losses. Our findings
estimate the median number of unplaced pigs in the first year was 153,020 (IQR
27,377 to 1,307,899) under the NRP scenario. Shorter control zone durations (20
to 25 days) effectively reduce the median number of unplaced pigs by 16.7% to
33.5%, whereas longer durations (40 days) increase unplacement numbers by 32%.
The median number of depopulated pigs remains broadly consistent across all
durations. Expanding the infected zone (5 to 15 km) increases the median number
of unplaced pigs by 53.6% to 282% while reducing depopulated pigs by 28.8% to
73.9%, respectively. Economic losses are estimated through a model that
includes depopulated and unplaced animals requiring culling. We examined the
situations when 5%, 12%, or 20% of unplaced pigs required culling and found
that the total cost ranged from zero (no second infection) to over $800

on smart inverters. We conduct an in-depth study based on the electricity
market data of Australia and the knowledge of practical contingency mechanisms.
Our key findings reveal: (1) Despite the possibility of disruption to the grid
by cyberattacks on smart inverters, the impact is only significant under
careful planning and orchestration. (2) While the grid can assure certain power
system security to survive inadvertent contingency events, it is insufficient
to defend against savvy attackers who can orchestrate attacks in an adversarial
manner. Our data analysis of Australia's electricity grid also reveals that a
relatively low percentage of distributed PV would be sufficient to launch an
impactful concerted attack on the grid. Our study casts insights on robust
strategies for defending the grid in the presence of cyberattacks for places
with high penetration of distributed PV.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper investigates prior prompt engineering (pPE) in the context of
reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), where language models (LMs) are incentivized
to exhibit behaviors that maximize performance through reward signals. While
existing RFT research has primarily focused on algorithms, reward shaping, and
data curation, the design of the prior prompt--the instructions prepended to
queries during training to elicit behaviors such as step-by-step
reasoning--remains underexplored. We investigate whether different pPE
approaches can guide LMs to internalize distinct behaviors after RFT. Inspired
by inference-time prompt engineering (iPE), we translate five representative
iPE strategies--reasoning, planning, code-based reasoning, knowledge recall,
and null-example utilization--into corresponding pPE approaches. We experiment
with Qwen2.5-7B using each of the pPE approaches, then evaluate performance on
in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks (e.g., AIME2024, HumanEval+, and
GPQA-Diamond). Our results show that all pPE-trained models surpass their
iPE-prompted counterparts, with the null-example pPE approach achieving the
largest average performance gain and the highest improvement on AIME2024 and
GPQA-Diamond, surpassing the commonly used reasoning approach. Furthermore, by
adapting a behavior-classification framework, we demonstrate that different pPE
strategies instill distinct behavioral styles in the resulting models. These
findings position pPE as a powerful yet understudied axis for RFT.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Knowledge components (KCs) are the fundamental units of knowledge in the
field of education. A KC graph illustrates the relationships and dependencies
between KCs. An accurate KC graph can assist educators in identifying the root
causes of learners' poor performance on specific KCs, thereby enabling targeted
instructional interventions. To achieve this, we have developed a KC graph
structure learning algorithm, named MAS-KCL, which employs a multi-agent system
driven by large language models for adaptive modification and optimization of
the KC graph. Additionally, a bidirectional feedback mechanism is integrated
into the algorithm, where AI agents leverage this mechanism to assess the value
of edges within the KC graph and adjust the distribution of generation
probabilities for different edges, thereby accelerating the efficiency of
structure learning. We applied the proposed algorithm to 5 synthetic datasets
and 4 real-world educational datasets, and experimental results validate its
effectiveness in learning path recognition. By accurately identifying learners'
learning paths, teachers are able to design more comprehensive learning plans,
enabling learners to achieve their educational goals more effectively, thus
promoting the sustainable development of education.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Generating large-scale multi-character interactions is a challenging and
important task in character animation. Multi-character interactions involve not
only natural interactive motions but also characters coordinated with each
other for transition. For example, a dance scenario involves characters dancing
with partners and also characters coordinated to new partners based on spatial
and temporal observations. We term such transitions as coordinated interactions
and decompose them into interaction synthesis and transition planning. Previous
methods of single-character animation do not consider interactions that are
critical for multiple characters. Deep-learning-based interaction synthesis
usually focuses on two characters and does not consider transition planning.
Optimization-based interaction synthesis relies on manually designing objective
functions that may not generalize well. While crowd simulation involves more
characters, their interactions are sparse and passive. We identify two
challenges to multi-character interaction synthesis, including the lack of data
and the planning of transitions among close and dense interactions. Existing
datasets either do not have multiple characters or do not have close and dense
interactions. The planning of transitions for multi-character close and dense
interactions needs both spatial and temporal considerations. We propose a
conditional generative pipeline comprising a coordinatable multi-character
interaction space for interaction synthesis and a transition planning network
for coordinations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed pipeline for multicharacter interaction synthesis and the applications
facilitated by our method show the scalability and transferability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Scenario-based testing using simulations is a cornerstone of Autonomous
Vehicles (AVs) software validation. So far, developers needed to choose between
low-fidelity 2D simulators to explore the scenario space efficiently, and
high-fidelity 3D simulators to study relevant scenarios in more detail, thus
reducing testing costs while mitigating the sim-to-real gap. This paper
presents a novel framework that leverages multi-agent co-simulation and
procedural scenario generation to support scenario-based testing across low-
and high-fidelity simulators for the development of motion planning algorithms.
Our framework limits the effort required to transition scenarios between
simulators and automates experiment execution, trajectory analysis, and
visualization. Experiments with a reference motion planner show that our
framework uncovers discrepancies between the planner's intended and actual
behavior, thus exposing weaknesses in planning assumptions under more realistic

<p class='card-text'>The transition to hydrogen powered transportation requires regionally
tailored yet scalable infrastructure planning. This study presents the first
Texas specific, multi-period mixed integer optimization model for hydrogen
transportation from 2025 to 2050, addressing challenges in infrastructure
phasing, asset coordination, and multimodal logistics. The framework introduces
three innovations: (1) phased deployment with delayed investment constraints,
(2) dynamic modeling of fleet aging and replacement, and (3) a clustering-based
hub structure enabling adaptive two-stage hydrogen delivery. Simulations show
pipeline deployment supports up to 94.8% of hydrogen flow by 2050 under high
demand, reducing transport costs by 23% compared to vehicle-based systems.
However, one-year construction delays reduce pipeline coverage by over 60%,
shifting reliance to costlier road transport. While the study focuses on Texas,
its modular design and adaptable inputs apply to other regions. It provides a

<p class='card-text'>Pulmonary segment segmentation is crucial for cancer localization and
surgical planning. However, the pixel-wise annotation of pulmonary segments is
laborious, as the boundaries between segments are indistinguishable in medical
images. To this end, we propose a weakly supervised learning (WSL) method,
termed Anatomy-Hierarchy Supervised Learning (AHSL), which consults the precise
clinical anatomical definition of pulmonary segments to perform pulmonary
segment segmentation. Since pulmonary segments reside within the lobes and are
determined by the bronchovascular tree, i.e., artery, airway and vein, the
design of the loss function is founded on two principles. First, segment-level
labels are utilized to directly supervise the output of the pulmonary segments,
ensuring that they accurately encompass the appropriate bronchovascular tree.
Second, lobe-level supervision indirectly oversees the pulmonary segment,
ensuring their inclusion within the corresponding lobe. Besides, we introduce a
two-stage segmentation strategy that incorporates bronchovascular priori
information. Furthermore, a consistency loss is proposed to enhance the
smoothness of segment boundaries, along with an evaluation metric designed to
measure the smoothness of pulmonary segment boundaries. Visual inspection and
evaluation metrics from experiments conducted on a private dataset demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-20 03:50:29</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs) is challenging due to their
complex dynamics and the need for safe interaction in contact-rich
environments. Most existing models focus on shape prediction alone and fail to
account for contact and tension constraints, which can lead to damage to both
the DLO and the robot. In this work, we propose a certifiably safe motion
planning and control framework for DLO manipulation. At the core of our method
is a predictive model that jointly estimates the DLO's future shape and
tension. These predictions are integrated into a real-time trajectory optimizer
based on polynomial zonotopes, allowing us to enforce safety constraints
throughout the execution. We evaluate our framework on a simulated wire harness
assembly task using a 7-DOF robotic arm. Compared to state-of-the-art methods,
our approach achieves a higher task success rate while avoiding all safety
violations. The results demonstrate that our method enables robust and safe DLO

<p class='card-text'>Achieving coordinated teamwork among legged robots requires both fine-grained

offers a compelling testbed for this challenge, combining dynamic, competitive,
and multi-agent interactions. In this work, we present a hierarchical
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables fully
autonomous and decentralized quadruped robot soccer. First, a set of highly
dynamic low-level skills is trained for legged locomotion and ball
manipulation, such as walking, dribbling, and kicking. On top of these, a
high-level strategic planning policy is trained with Multi-Agent Proximal
Policy Optimization (MAPPO) via Fictitious Self-Play (FSP). This learning
framework allows agents to adapt to diverse opponent strategies and gives rise
to sophisticated team behaviors, including coordinated passing, interception,
and dynamic role allocation. With an extensive ablation study, the proposed
learning method shows significant advantages in the cooperative and competitive
multi-agent soccer game. We deploy the learned policies to real quadruped
robots relying solely on onboard proprioception and decentralized localization,
with the resulting system supporting autonomous robot-robot and robot-human

<p class='card-text'>The sequence form, owing to its compact and holistic strategy representation,
has demonstrated significant efficiency in computing normal-form perfect
equilibria for two-player extensive-form games with perfect recall.
Nevertheless, the examination of $n$-player games remains underexplored. To
tackle this challenge, we present a sequence-form characterization of
normal-form perfect equilibria for $n$-player extensive-form games, achieved
through a class of perturbed games formulated in sequence form. Based on this
characterization, we develop a differentiable path-following method for
computing normal-form perfect equilibria and prove its convergence. This method
involves constructing an artificial logarithmic-barrier game in sequence form,
where an additional variable is incorporated to regulate the influence of
logarithmic-barrier terms to the payoff functions, as well as the transition of
the strategy space. We prove the existence of a smooth equilibrium path defined
by the artificial game, starting from an arbitrary positive realization plan
and converging to a normal-form perfect equilibrium of the original game as the
additional variable approaches zero. Furthermore, we extend Harsanyi's linear
and logarithmic tracing procedures to the sequence form and develop two
alternative methods for computing normal-form perfect equilibria. Numerical
experiments further substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of our

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-20 00:03:21</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The paper presents a novel sample-based algorithm, called C*, for real-time
coverage path planning (CPP) of unknown environments. The C* algorithm is built
upon the concept of Rapidly Covering Graph (RCGs). The RCG is constructed
incrementally via progressive sampling during robot navigation, which
eliminates the need for cellular decomposition of the search space. The RCG has
a sparse-graph structure formed by efficient sampling and pruning techniques,
which produces non-myopic waypoints of the coverage trajectory. While C*
produces the desired back and forth coverage pattern, it adapts to the
TSP-based locally optimal coverage of small uncovered regions, called coverage
holes, that are surrounded by obstacles and covered regions. Thus, C*
proactively detects and covers the coverage holes in situ, which reduces the
coverage time by preventing the longer return trajectories from distant regions
to cover such holes later. The algorithmic simplicity and low computational
complexity of C* makes it easy to implement and suitable for real-time onboard
applications. It is analytically proven that C* provides complete coverage of
unknown environments. The performance of C* is validated by 1) extensive
high-fidelity simulations and 2) real laboratory experiments using autonomous
robots. A comparative evaluation with seven existing CPP methods demonstrate
that C* yields significant performance improvements in terms of coverage time,
number of turns, trajectory length and overlap ratio, while preventing the
formation of coverage holes. Finally, C* is evaluated on two different
applications of CPP using 1) energy-constrained robots and 2) multi-robot
teams.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Collision-free planning is essential for bipedal robots operating within
unstructured environments. This paper presents a real-time Model Predictive
Control (MPC) framework that addresses both body and foot avoidance for dynamic
bipedal robots. Our contribution is two-fold: we introduce (1) a novel
formulation for adjusting step timing to facilitate faster body avoidance and
(2) a novel 3D foot-avoidance formulation that implicitly selects swing
trajectories and footholds that either steps over or navigate around obstacles
with awareness of Center of Mass (COM) dynamics. We achieve body avoidance by
applying a half-space relaxation of the safe region but introduce a switching
heuristic based on tracking error to detect a need to change foot-timing
schedules. To enable foot avoidance and viable landing footholds on all sides
of foot-level obstacles, we decompose the non-convex safe region on the ground
into several convex polygons and use Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming to
determine the optimal candidate. We found that introducing a soft
minimum-travel-distance constraint is effective in preventing the MPC from
being trapped in local minima that can stall half-space relaxation methods
behind obstacles. We demonstrated the proposed algorithms on multibody
simulations on the bipedal robot platforms, Cassie and Digit, as well as

<p class='card-text'>Many animals possess a remarkable capacity to rapidly construct flexible
mental models of their environments. These world models are crucial for
ethologically relevant behaviors such as navigation, exploration, and planning.
The ability to form episodic memories and make inferences based on these sparse
experiences is believed to underpin the efficiency and adaptability of these
models in the brain. Here, we ask: Can a neural network learn to construct a
spatial model of its surroundings from sparse and disjoint episodic memories?
We formulate the problem in a simulated world and propose a novel framework,
the Episodic Spatial World Model (ESWM), as a potential answer. We show that
ESWM is highly sample-efficient, requiring minimal observations to construct a
robust representation of the environment. It is also inherently adaptive,
allowing for rapid updates when the environment changes. In addition, we
demonstrate that ESWM readily enables near-optimal strategies for exploring
novel environments and navigating between arbitrary points, all without the
