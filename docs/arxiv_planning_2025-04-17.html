<p class='card-text'>We describe a resonant cavity search apparatus for axion dark matter
constructed by the Quantum Sensors for the Hidden Sector (QSHS) collaboration.
The apparatus is configured to search for QCD axion dark matter, though also
has the capability to detect axion-like particles (ALPs), dark photons, and
some other forms of wave-like dark matter. Initially, a tuneable cylindrical
oxygen-free copper cavity is read out using a low noise microwave amplifier
feeding a heterodyne receiver. The cavity is housed in a dilution refrigerator
and threaded by a solenoidal magnetic field, nominally 8T. The apparatus also
houses a magnetic field shield for housing superconducting electronics, and
several other fixed-frequency resonators for use in testing and commissioning
various prototype quantum electronic devices sensitive at a range of axion
masses in the range $\rm 2.0$ to $\rm 40\,eV/c^2$. We present performance data
for the resonator, dilution refrigerator, and magnet, and plans for the first

<p class='card-text'>In radiation therapy planning, inaccurate segmentations of organs at risk can
result in suboptimal treatment delivery, if left undetected by the clinician.
To address this challenge, we developed a denoising autoencoder-based method to
detect inaccurate organ segmentations. We applied noise to ground truth organ
segmentations, and the autoencoders were tasked to denoise them. Through the
application of our method to organ segmentations generated on both MR and CT
scans, we demonstrated that the method is independent of imaging modality. By
providing reconstructions, our method offers visual information about
inaccurate regions of the organ segmentations, leading to more explainable
detection of suboptimal segmentations. We compared our method to existing
approaches in the literature and demonstrated that it achieved superior
performance for the majority of organs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Detection of spatial areas where biodiversity is at risk is of paramount
importance for the conservation and monitoring of ecosystems. Large terrestrial
mammalian herbivores are keystone species as their activity not only has deep
effects on soils, plants, and animals, but also shapes landscapes, as large
herbivores act as allogenic ecosystem engineers. One key landscape feature that
indicates intense herbivore activity and potentially impacts biodiversity is
the formation of grazing trails. Grazing trails are formed by the continuous
trampling activity of large herbivores that can produce complex networks of
tracks of bare soil. Here, we evaluated different algorithms based on machine
learning techniques to identify grazing trails. Our goal is to automatically
detect potential areas with intense herbivory activity, which might be
beneficial for conservation and management plans.
  We have applied five semantic segmentation methods combined with fourteen
encoders aimed at mapping grazing trails on aerial images. Our results indicate
that in most cases the chosen methodology successfully mapped the trails,
although there were a few instances where the actual trail structure was
underestimated. The UNet architecture with the MambaOut encoder was the best
architecture for mapping trails. The proposed approach could be applied to
develop tools for mapping and monitoring temporal changes in these landscape
structures to support habitat conservation and land management programs. This
is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that competitive image
segmentation results are obtained for the detection and delineation of trails
of large herbivorous mammals.</p>

  Offline and Online Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Racing</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-16 14:25:29</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous vehicles often
assume a fixed vehicle model that remains constant regardless of the vehicle's
location. This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are
the two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay
with the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these
challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving
dynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to
autonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial
resolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing
adaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for
location-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased
safety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on
low storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework
proved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form.
Experiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In
future work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing
future interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions
in real-time.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-16 14:17:31</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Achieving reliable and safe autonomous driving in off-road environments
requires accurate and efficient terrain traversability analysis. However, this
task faces several challenges, including the scarcity of large-scale datasets
tailored for off-road scenarios, the high cost and potential errors of manual
annotation, the stringent real-time requirements of motion planning, and the
limited computational power of onboard units. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel traversability learning method that leverages
self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for manual annotation. For the
first time, a Birds-Eye View (BEV) representation is used as input, reducing
computational burden and improving adaptability to downstream motion planning.
During vehicle operation, the proposed method conducts online analysis of
traversed regions and dynamically updates prototypes to adaptively assess the
traversability of the current environment, effectively handling dynamic scene
changes. We evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art benchmarks on both
public datasets and our own dataset, covering diverse seasons and geographical
locations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms recent approaches. Additionally, real-world vehicle experiments
show that our method operates at 10 Hz, meeting real-time requirements, while a
5.5 km autonomous driving experiment further validates the generated
traversability cost maps compatibility with downstream motion planning.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-16 09:26:04</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The growing integration of robots in shared environments -- such as
warehouses, shopping centres, and hospitals -- demands a deep understanding of
the underlying dynamics and human behaviours, including how, when, and where
individuals engage in various activities and interactions. This knowledge goes
beyond simple correlation studies and requires a more comprehensive causal
analysis. By leveraging causal inference to model cause-and-effect
relationships, we can better anticipate critical environmental factors and
enable autonomous robots to plan and execute tasks more effectively. To this
end, we propose a novel causality-based decision-making framework that reasons
over a learned causal model to predict battery usage and human obstructions,
understanding how these factors could influence robot task execution. Such
reasoning framework assists the robot in deciding when and how to complete a
given task. To achieve this, we developed also PeopleFlow, a new Gazebo-based
simulator designed to model context-sensitive human-robot spatial interactions
in shared workspaces. PeopleFlow features realistic human and robot
trajectories influenced by contextual factors such as time, environment layout,
and robot state, and can simulate a large number of agents. While the simulator
is general-purpose, in this paper we focus on a warehouse-like environment as a
case study, where we conduct an extensive evaluation benchmarking our causal
approach against a non-causal baseline. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed solutions, highlighting how causal reasoning enables autonomous
robots to operate more efficiently and safely in dynamic environments shared
with humans.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-16 08:49:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Pelvic fractures, often caused by high-impact trauma, frequently require
surgical intervention. Imaging techniques such as CT and 2D X-ray imaging are
used to transfer the surgical plan to the operating room through image
registration, enabling quick intraoperative adjustments. Specifically,
segmenting pelvic fractures from 2D X-ray imaging can assist in accurately
positioning bone fragments and guiding the placement of screws or metal plates.
In this study, we propose a novel deep learning-based category and fragment
segmentation (CFS) framework for the automatic segmentation of pelvic bone
fragments in 2D X-ray images. The framework consists of three consecutive
steps: category segmentation, fragment segmentation, and post-processing. Our
best model achieves an IoU of 0.91 for anatomical structures and 0.78 for
fracture segmentation. Results demonstrate that the CFS framework is effective
and accurate.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper aims to efficiently compute transport maps between probability
distributions arising from particle representation of bio-physical problems. We
develop a bidirectional DeepParticle (BDP) method to learn and generate
solutions under varying physical parameters. Solutions are approximated as
empirical measures of particles that adaptively align with the high-gradient
regions. The core idea of the BDP method is to learn both forward and reverse
mappings (between the uniform and a non-trivial target distribution) by
minimizing the discrete 2-Wasserstein distance (W2) and optimizing the
transition map therein by a minibatch technique. We present numerical results
demonstrating the effectiveness of the BDP method for learning and generating
solutions to Keller-Segel chemotaxis systems in the presence of laminar flows
and Kolmogorov flows with chaotic streamlines in three space dimensions. The
BDP outperforms two recent representative single-step flow matching and
diffusion models (rectified flow and shortcut diffusion models) in the
generative AI literature. However when the target distribution is
high-dimensional (4 and above), e.g. a mixture of two Gaussians, the
single-step diffusion models scale better in dimensions than BDP in terms of
W2-accuracy.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-16 07:17:36</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have demonstrated significant potential
in 3D medical image segmentation tasks. However, their high computational cost
and inability to fully capture global 3D contextual information limit their
practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
text-guided diffusion model framework, TextDiffSeg. This method leverages a
conditional diffusion framework that integrates 3D volumetric data with natural
language descriptions, enabling cross-modal embedding and establishing a shared
semantic space between visual and textual modalities. By enhancing the model's
ability to recognize complex anatomical structures, TextDiffSeg incorporates
innovative label embedding techniques and cross-modal attention mechanisms,
effectively reducing computational complexity while preserving global 3D
contextual integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that TextDiffSeg
consistently outperforms existing methods in segmentation tasks involving
kidney and pancreas tumors, as well as multi-organ segmentation scenarios.
Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components,
highlighting the synergistic interaction between text fusion, image feature
extractor, and label encoder. TextDiffSeg provides an efficient and accurate
solution for 3D medical image segmentation, showcasing its broad applicability
in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-16 07:16:35</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Cooperative path planning is gaining its importance due to the increasing
demand on using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for complex missions.
This work addresses the problem by introducing a new algorithm named MultiRRT
that extends the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) to generate paths for a
group of UAVs to reach multiple goal locations at the same time. We first
derive the dynamics constraint of the UAV and include it in the problem
formulation. MultiRRT is then developed, taking into account the cooperative
requirements and safe constraints during its path-searching process. The
algorithm features two new mechanisms, node reduction and Bezier interpolation,
to ensure the feasibility and optimality of the paths generated. Importantly,
the interpolated paths are proven to meet the safety and dynamics constraints
imposed by obstacles and the UAVs. A number of simulations, comparisons, and
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
approach. The results show that MultiRRT can generate collision-free paths for
multiple UAVs to reach their goals with better scores in path length and
smoothness metrics than state-of-the-art RRT variants including Theta-RRT,
FN-RRT, RRT*, and RRT*-Smart. The generated paths are also tested in practical
flights with real UAVs to evaluate their validity for cooperative tasks. The

<p class='card-text'>Modern analytical query engines (AQEs) are essential for large-scale data
analysis and processing. These systems usually provide numerous query-level
tunable knobs that significantly affect individual query performance. While
several studies have explored automatic DBMS configuration tuning, they have
several limitations to handle query-level tuning. Firstly, they fail to capture
how knobs influence query plans, which directly affect query performance.
Secondly, they overlook query failures during the tuning processing, resulting
in low tuning efficiency. Thirdly, they struggle with cold-start problems for
new queries, leading to prolonged tuning time. To address these challenges, we
propose AQETuner, a novel Bayesian Optimization-based system tailored for
reliable query-level knob tuning in AQEs. AQETuner first applies the attention
mechanisms to jointly encode the knobs and plan query, effectively identifying
the impact of knobs on plan nodes. Then, AQETuner employs a dual-task Neural
Process to predict both query performance and failures, leveraging their

Particle Swarm Optimization to efficiently generate high-quality samples in

by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic
optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching,
being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples
towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as
well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian

up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer

<p class='card-text'>Radio telescopes observe extremely faint emission from astronomical objects,
ranging from compact sources to large scale structures that can be seen across
the whole sky. Satellites actively transmit at radio frequencies (particularly
at 10--20\,GHz, but usage of increasing broader frequency ranges are already
planned for the future by satellite operators), and can appear as bright as the
Sun in radio astronomy observations. Remote locations have historically enabled
telescopes to avoid most interference, however this is no longer the case with
dramatically increasing numbers of satellites that transmit everywhere on
Earth. Even more remote locations such as the far side of the Moon may provide
new radio astronomy observation opportunities, but only if they are protected
from satellite transmissions. Improving our understanding of satellite
transmissions on radio telescopes across the whole spectrum and beyond is
urgently needed to overcome this new observational challenge, as part of
ensuring the future access to dark and quiet skies.
  In this contribution we summarise the current status of observations of
active satellites at radio frequencies, the implications for future
astronomical observations, and the longer-term consequences of an increasing
number of active satellites. This will include frequencies where satellites
actively transmit, where they unintentionally also transmit, and considerations
about thermal emission and other unintended emissions. This work is ongoing
through the IAU CPS.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The increasing availability of intraoral scanning devices has heightened
their importance in modern clinical orthodontics. Clinicians utilize advanced
Computer-Aided Design techniques to create patient-specific treatment plans
that include laboriously identifying crucial landmarks such as cusps,
mesial-distal locations, facial axis points, and tooth-gingiva boundaries.
Detecting such landmarks automatically presents challenges, including limited
dataset sizes, significant anatomical variability among subjects, and the
geometric nature of the data. We present our experiments from the 3DTeethLand
Grand Challenge at MICCAI 2024. Our method leverages recent advancements in
point cloud learning through transformer architectures. We designed a Point
Transformer v3 inspired module to capture meaningful geometric and anatomical
features, which are processed by a lightweight decoder to predict per-point
distances, further processed by graph-based non-minima suppression. We report
promising results and discuss insights on learned feature interpretability.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-15 16:09:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The structure of causal language model training assumes that each token can
be accurately predicted from the previous context. This contrasts with humans'
natural writing and reasoning process, where goals are typically known before
the exact argument or phrasings. While this mismatch has been well studied in
the literature, the working assumption has been that architectural changes are
needed to address this mismatch. We argue that rearranging and processing the
training data sequences can allow models to more accurately imitate the true
data-generating process, and does not require any other changes to the
architecture or training infrastructure. We demonstrate that this technique,
Trelawney, and the inference algorithms derived from it allow us to improve
performance on several key benchmarks that span planning, algorithmic
reasoning, and story generation tasks. Finally, our method naturally enables
the generation of long-term goals at no additional cost. We investigate how
using the model's goal-generation capability can further improve planning and
reasoning. Additionally, we believe Trelawney could potentially open doors to
new capabilities beyond the current language modeling paradigm.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-15 13:11:47</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper introduces the Robotability Score ($R$), a novel metric that
quantifies the suitability of urban environments for autonomous robot
navigation. Through expert interviews and surveys, we identify and weigh key
features contributing to R for wheeled robots on urban streets. Our findings
reveal that pedestrian density, crowd dynamics and pedestrian flow are the most
critical factors, collectively accounting for 28% of the total score. Computing
robotability across New York City yields significant variation; the area of
highest R is 3.0 times more "robotable" than the area of lowest R. Deployments
of a physical robot on high and low robotability areas show the adequacy of the
score in anticipating the ease of robot navigation. This new framework for
evaluating urban landscapes aims to reduce uncertainty in robot deployment
while respecting established mobility patterns and urban planning principles,
contributing to the discourse on harmonious human-robot environments.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-15 12:34:09</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In this paper we determine quantitative stability bounds for the Hessian of
entropic potentials, i.e., the dual solution to the entropic optimal transport
problem. Up to authors' knowledge this is the first work addressing this
second-order quantitative stability estimate in general unbounded settings. Our
proof strategy relies on semiconcavity properties of entropic potentials and on
the representation of entropic transport plans as laws of forward and backward
diffusion processes, known as Schr\"odinger bridges. Moreover, our approach
allows to deduce a stochastic proof of quantitative stability entropic
estimates and integrated gradient estimates as well. Finally, as a direct
consequence of these stability bounds, we deduce exponential convergence rates
for gradient and Hessian of Sinkhorn iterates along Sinkhorn's algorithm, a
problem that was still open in unbounded settings. Our rates have a polynomial
dependence on the regularization parameter.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-15 11:16:09</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Online map construction is essential for autonomous robots to navigate in
unknown environments. However, the presence of dynamic objects may introduce
artifacts into the map, which can significantly degrade the performance of
localization and path planning. To tackle this problem, a novel online dynamic
object removal framework for static map construction based on conservative free
space estimation (FreeDOM) is proposed, consisting of a scan-removal front-end
and a map-refinement back-end. First, we propose a multi-resolution map
structure for fast computation and effective map representation. In the
scan-removal front-end, we employ raycast enhancement to improve free space
estimation and segment the LiDAR scan based on the estimated free space. In the
map-refinement back-end, we further eliminate residual dynamic objects in the
map by leveraging incremental free space information. As experimentally
verified on SemanticKITTI, HeLiMOS, and indoor datasets with various sensors,
our proposed framework overcomes the limitations of visibility-based methods
and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an average F1-score improvement
of 9.7%.</p>

  treatment of construction and demolition waste</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-15 08:00:46</h6>
<p class='card-text'>More than 10 billion tons of construction and demolition waste (CW) are
generated globally each year, exerting a significant impact on the environment.
In the CW recycling process, the government and the carrier are the two primary
stakeholders. The carrier is responsible for transporting CW from production
sites to backfill sites or processing facilities, with a primary focus on
transport efficiency and revenue. Meanwhile, the government aims to minimize
pollution from the recycling system, which is influenced by transport modes,
shipment distances, and the processing methods used for CW. This paper develops
a bi-objective, bi-level optimization model to address these challenges. The
upper-level model is a linear programming model that optimizes the government's
subsidy scheme, while the lower-level model is a minimum-cost flow model that
optimizes the carrier's recycling plan. A hybrid heuristic solution method is
proposed to tackle the problem's complexity. A case study in Chengdu, China,
demonstrates the computational efficiency of the model and its small solution
gap. With an optimized subsidy scheme and recycling plan, pollution can be
reduced by over 29.29% through a relatively small investment in subsidies.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-15 05:47:09</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Accurate rib fracture identification and classification are essential for
treatment planning. However, existing datasets often lack fine-grained
annotations, particularly regarding rib fracture characterization, type, and
precise anatomical location on individual ribs. To address this, we introduce a
novel rib fracture annotation protocol tailored for fracture classification.
Further, we enhance fracture classification by leveraging cross-modal
embeddings that bridge radiological images and clinical descriptions. Our
approach employs hyperbolic embeddings to capture the hierarchical nature of
fracture, mapping visual features and textual descriptions into a shared
non-Euclidean manifold. This framework enables more nuanced similarity
computations between imaging characteristics and clinical descriptions,
accounting for the inherent hierarchical relationships in fracture taxonomy.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods
across multiple classification tasks, with average recall improvements of 6% on
the AirRib dataset and 17.5% on the public RibFrac dataset.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The problem of finding a path between two points while avoiding obstacles is
critical in robotic path planning. We focus on the feasibility problem:
determining whether such a path exists. We model the robot as a query-specific
rectangular object capable of moving parallel to its sides. The obstacles are
axis-aligned, rectangular, and may overlap. Most previous works only consider
nondisjoint rectangular objects and point-sized or statically sized robots. Our
approach introduces a novel technique leveraging generalized Gabriel graphs and
constructs a data structure to facilitate online queries regarding path
feasibility with varying robot sizes in sublinear time. To efficiently handle
feasibility queries, we propose an online algorithm utilizing sweep line to
construct a generalized Gabriel graph under the $L_\infty$ norm, capturing key
gap constraints between obstacles. We utilize a persistent disjoint-set union
data structure to efficiently determine feasibility queries in
$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ total space.</p>

unsafe actions that could lead to battery depletion or duplicate visits,
effectively mitigating hallucinations. Furthermore, a dual replay buffer
mechanism helps both the GPT modules and the RL agent refine their strategies
over time. Simulation results demonstrate that SafeGPT achieves higher delivery

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-15 03:11:10</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Navigating in crowded environments requires the robot to be equipped with
high-level reasoning and planning techniques. Existing works focus on
developing complex and heavyweight planners while ignoring the role of human
intelligence. Since humans are highly capable agents who are also widely
available in a crowd navigation setting, we propose an alternative scheme where
the robot utilises people as planners to benefit from their effective planning
decisions and social behaviours. Through a set of rule-based evaluations, we
identify suitable human leaders who exhibit the potential to guide the robot
towards its goal. Using a simple base planner, the robot follows the selected
leader through shorthorizon subgoals that are designed to be straightforward to
achieve. We demonstrate through both simulated and real-world experiments that
our novel framework generates safe and efficient robot plans compared to
existing planners, even without predictive or data-driven modules. Our method
also brings human-like robot behaviours without explicitly defining traffic
rules and social norms. Code will be available at

domain, offers a platform for decentralized applications but is challenged by
the immutability of smart contracts, which makes upgrades cumbersome. Existing

secure, in-place upgrades without losing historical data, FlexiContracts
surpasses existing approaches, introducing a previously unexplored path in
smart contract evolution. Its streamlined design transcends the limitations of
current design patterns by simplifying smart contract development, eliminating
the need for extensive upfront planning, and significantly reducing the
complexity of the design process. This advancement fosters an environment for
continuous improvement and adaptation to new requirements, redefining the
possibilities for dynamic, upgradable smart contracts.</p>
