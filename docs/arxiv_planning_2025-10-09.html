  Preferences</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 17:40:41</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Many real-world scenarios require multiple agents to coordinate in shared
environments, while balancing trade-offs between multiple, potentially
competing objectives. Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding
(MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Pareto
frontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even
when the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of
objectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along
with an algorithm \textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that
directly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference
over objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search with
conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enabling
efficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insights
into optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computes
optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- far
beyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods. Evaluations on standard and
randomized MAPF benchmarks show consistently higher success rates against
state-of-the-art baselines, especially with increasing number of objectives.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 17:20:53</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) trains policies that
reach user-specified goals at test time, providing a simple, unsupervised,
domain-agnostic way to extract diverse behaviors from unlabeled, reward-free
datasets. Nonetheless, long-horizon decision making remains difficult for GCRL
agents due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, and the
offline setting amplifies these effects. To alleviate this issue, we introduce
Test-Time Graph Search (TTGS), a lightweight planning approach to solve the
GCRL task. TTGS accepts any state-space distance or cost signal, builds a
weighted graph over dataset states, and performs fast search to assemble a
sequence of subgoals that a frozen policy executes. When the base learner is
value-based, the distance is derived directly from the learned goal-conditioned
value function, so no handcrafted metric is needed. TTGS requires no changes to
training, no additional supervision, no online interaction, and no privileged
information, and it runs entirely at inference. On the OGBench benchmark, TTGS
improves success rates of multiple base learners on challenging locomotion
tasks, demonstrating the benefit of simple metric-guided test-time planning for
offline GCRL.</p>

  Micro-Mobility Services</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Binyu Yang, Jinxiao Du, Junlin He, Shi An, Wei Ma</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 16:26:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The spatial-temporal imbalance between supply and demand in shared
micro-mobility services often leads to observed demand being censored,
resulting in incomplete records of the underlying real demand. This phenomenon
undermines the reliability of the collected demand data and hampers downstream
applications such as demand forecasting, fleet management, and micro-mobility
planning. How to accurately estimate the real demand is challenging and has not
been well explored in existing studies. In view of this, we contribute to real
demand estimation for shared micro-mobility services by proposing an analytical
method that rigorously derives the real demand under appropriate assumptions.
Rather than directly modeling the intractable relationship between observed
demand and real demand, we propose a novel random variable, Generalized Vehicle
Survival Time (GVST), which is observable from trip records. The relationship
between GVST and real demand is characterized by introducing a flipped queueing
model (FQM) that captures the operational dynamics of shared micro-mobility
services. Specifically, the distribution of GVST is derived within the FQM,
which allows the real demand estimation problem to be transformed into an
inverse queueing problem. We analytically derive the real demand in closed form
using a one-sided estimation method, and solve the problem by a system of
equations in a two-sided estimation method. We validate the proposed methods
using synthetic data and conduct empirical analyses using real-world datasets
from bike-sharing and shared e-scooter systems. The experimental results show
that both the two-sided and one-sided methods outperform benchmark models. In
particular, the one-sided approach provides a closed-form solution that
delivers acceptable accuracy, constituting a practical rule of thumb for
demand-related analytics and decision-making processes.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 13:58:31</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Multi-fingered hands are emerging as powerful platforms for performing fine
manipulation tasks, including tool use. However, environmental perturbations or
execution errors can impede task performance, motivating the use of recovery
behaviors that enable normal task execution to resume. In this work, we take
advantage of recent advances in diffusion models to construct a framework that
autonomously identifies when recovery is necessary and optimizes contact-rich
trajectories to recover. We use a diffusion model trained on the task to
estimate when states are not conducive to task execution, framed as an
out-of-distribution detection problem. We then use diffusion sampling to
project these states in-distribution and use trajectory optimization to plan
contact-rich recovery trajectories. We also propose a novel diffusion-based
approach that distills this process to efficiently diffuse the full
parameterization, including constraints, goal state, and initialization, of the
recovery trajectory optimization problem, saving time during online execution.
We compare our method to a reinforcement learning baseline and other methods
that do not explicitly plan contact interactions, including on a hardware
screwdriver-turning task where we show that recovering using our method
improves task performance by 96% and that ours is the only method evaluated
that can attempt recovery without causing catastrophic task failure. Videos can

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 13:57:29</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Periodic 3D reconstruction is essential for crop monitoring, but costly when
each cycle restarts from scratch, wasting resources and ignoring information
from previous captures. We propose temporal-prior-guided view planning for
periodic plant reconstruction, in which a previously reconstructed model of the
same plant is non-rigidly aligned to a new partial observation to form an
approximation of the current geometry. To accommodate plant growth, we inflate
this approximation and solve a set covering optimization problem to compute a
minimal set of views. We integrated this method into a complete pipeline that
acquires one additional next-best view before registration for robustness and
then plans a globally shortest path to connect the planned set of views and
outputs the best view sequence. Experiments on maize and tomato under
hemisphere and sphere view spaces show that our system maintains or improves
surface coverage while requiring fewer views and comparable movement cost
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 13:28:55</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This study develops and analyzes an optimization model of smart contract
adoption under bounded risk, linking structural theory with simulation and
real-world validation. We examine how adoption intensity alpha is structurally
pinned at a boundary solution, invariant to variance and heterogeneity, while
profitability and service outcomes are variance-fragile, eroding under
volatility and heavy-tailed demand. A sharp threshold in the fixed cost
parameter A3 triggers discontinuous adoption collapse (H1), variance shocks
reduce profits monotonically but not adoption (H2), and additional results on
readiness heterogeneity (H3), profit-service co-benefits (H4), and
distributional robustness (H5) confirm the duality between stable adoption and
fragile payoffs. External validity checks further establish convergence of
sample average approximation at the canonical O(1/sqrt(N)) rate (H6). Empirical
validation using S&P 500 returns and the MovieLens100K dataset corroborates the
theoretical structure: bounded and heavy-tailed distributions fit better than
Gaussian models, and profits diverge across volatility regimes even as adoption
remains stable. Taken together, the results demonstrate that adoption choices
are robust to uncertainty, but their financial consequences are highly fragile.
For operations and finance, this duality underscores the need for risk-adjusted
performance evaluation, option-theoretic modeling, and distributional stress
testing in strategic investment and supply chain design.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Compliance with maritime traffic rules is essential for the safe operation of
autonomous vessels, yet training reinforcement learning (RL) agents to adhere
to them is challenging. The behavior of RL agents is shaped by the training
scenarios they encounter, but creating scenarios that capture the complexity of
maritime navigation is non-trivial, and real-world data alone is insufficient.
To address this, we propose a falsification-driven RL approach that generates
adversarial training scenarios in which the vessel under test violates maritime
traffic rules, which are expressed as signal temporal logic specifications. Our
experiments on open-sea navigation with two vessels demonstrate that the
proposed approach provides more relevant training scenarios and achieves more

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 11:46:39</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous
driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning
approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning
suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
(GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key
source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a
discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic
interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed
Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map
and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and
neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that
augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging
overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based
backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Fangzhou Zhao, Yao Sun, Jianglin Lan, Lan Zhang, Xuesong Liu, Muhammad Ali Imran</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-08 11:30:57</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Effective path planning is fundamental to the coordination of unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) systems, particularly in
applications such as surveillance, navigation, and emergency response.
Combining UAVs' broad field of view with UGVs' ground-level operational
capability greatly improve the likelihood of successfully achieving task
objectives such as locating victims, monitoring target areas, or navigating
hazardous terrain. In complex environments, UAVs need to provide precise
environmental perception information for UGVs to optimize their routing policy.
However, due to severe interference and non-line-of-sight conditions, wireless
communication is often unstable in such complex environments, making it
difficult to support timely and accurate path planning for UAV-UGV
coordination. To this end, this paper proposes a semantic communication
(SemCom) framework to enhance UAV/UGV cooperative path planning under
unreliable wireless conditions. Unlike traditional methods that transmit raw
data, SemCom transmits only the key information for path planning, reducing
transmission volume without sacrificing accuracy. The proposed framework is
developed by defining key semantics for path planning and designing a
transceiver for meeting the requirements of UAV-UGV cooperative path planning.
Simulation results show that, compared to conventional SemCom transceivers, the
proposed transceiver significantly reduces data transmission volume while
maintaining path planning accuracy, thereby enhancing system collaboration
efficiency.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Lung infections, particularly pneumonia, pose serious health risks that can
escalate rapidly, especially during pandemics. Accurate AI-based severity
prediction from medical imaging is essential to support timely clinical
decisions and optimize patient outcomes. In this work, we present a novel

Transformer-based architecture that integrates parallel encoders, a cross-gated
attention mechanism, and a feature aggregator to capture rich multi-scale
features; and (ii) Conditional Online TransMix, a custom data augmentation
strategy designed to address dataset imbalance by generating mixed-label image

<p class='card-text'>Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental
challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound,
and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To
address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent

loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans.
It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and
integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research
proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop,
composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the
best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via
pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is
well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments
on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research

<p class='card-text'>Optimal transport (OT) and Schr{\"o}dinger bridge (SB) problems have emerged
as powerful frameworks for transferring probability distributions with minimal
cost. However, existing approaches typically focus on endpoint matching while
neglecting critical path-dependent properties -- particularly collision
avoidance in multiagent systems -- which limits their practical applicability
in robotics, economics, and other domains where inter-agent interactions are
essential. Moreover, traditional density control methods often rely on
independence assumptions that fail to capture swarm dynamics. We propose a
novel framework that addresses these limitations by employing flow matching as
the core modeling tool, where the flow model co-evolves with the control
policy. Unlike prior methods that treat transport trajectories as mere
interpolations between source and target distributions, our approach explicitly
optimizes over the entire transport path, enabling the incorporation of
trajectory-dependent costs and collision avoidance constraints. Our framework
bridges optimal transport theory with mean field control, providing a
principled approach to multiagent coordination problems where both endpoint
alignment and path properties are critical. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method successfully generates collision-free transport plans while

<p class='card-text'>Contemporary language models are fluent yet routinely mis-handle the types of
meaning their outputs entail. We argue that hallucination, brittle moderation,
and opaque compliance outcomes are symptoms of missing type-theoretic semantics
rather than data or scale limitations. Building on Montague's view of language
as typed, compositional algebra, we recast alignment as a parsing problem:
natural-language inputs must be compiled into structures that make explicit
their descriptive, normative, and legal dimensions under context.
  We present Savassan, a neuro-symbolic architecture that compiles utterances
into Montague-style logical forms and maps them to typed ontologies extended
with deontic operators and jurisdictional contexts. Neural components extract
candidate structures from unstructured inputs; symbolic components perform type
checking, constraint reasoning, and cross-jurisdiction mapping to produce
compliance-aware guidance rather than binary censorship. In cross-border
scenarios, the system "parses once" (e.g., defect claim(product x, company y))
and projects the result into multiple legal ontologies (e.g., defamation risk
in KR/JP, protected opinion in US, GDPR checks in EU), composing outcomes into
a single, explainable decision.
  This paper contributes: (i) a diagnosis of hallucination as a type error;
(ii) a formal Montague-ontology bridge for business/legal reasoning; and (iii)
a production-oriented design that embeds typed interfaces across the pipeline.
We outline an evaluation plan using legal reasoning benchmarks and synthetic
multi-jurisdiction suites. Our position is that trustworthy autonomy requires
compositional typing of meaning, enabling systems to reason about what is
described, what is prescribed, and what incurs liability within a unified
algebra of meaning.</p>

optimal flow or transport plan between two proteins, which are represented as
distributions of residues in a high-dimensional feature space. We leverage
pre-trained Protein Language Models (PLMs) to generate rich, context-aware
embeddings for each residue. The core of our method is the Fused Unbalanced
Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) distance, which finds a correspondence that
simultaneously minimizes feature dissimilarity and preserves the internal
geometric structure of the sequences. This approach naturally handles sequences
of different lengths and is particularly powerful for aligning proteins with
nonsequential similarities, such as domain shuffling or circular permutations,
which are challenging for traditional DP methods. UniOTalign therefore offers a
new, mathematically principled, global matching paradigm for protein alignment,
moving beyond the limitations of path-finding algorithms.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Safe navigation in uncertain environments requires planning methods that
integrate risk aversion with active perception. In this work, we present a
unified framework that refines a coarse reference path by constructing
tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on an
online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Field. These maps enable the
generation of locally safe and feasible trajectories. In parallel, we formulate
Next-Best-View (NBV) selection as an optimization problem on the SE(3) pose
manifold, where Riemannian gradient descent maximizes an expected information
gain objective to reduce uncertainty most critical for imminent motion. Our
approach advances the state-of-the-art by coupling risk-averse path refinement
with NBV planning, while introducing scalable gradient decompositions that
support efficient online updates in complex environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework through extensive computational
studies.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Load forecasting has always been a challenge for grid operators due to the
growing complexity of power systems. The increase in extreme weather and the
need for energy from customers has led to load forecasting sometimes failing.
This research presents a Support Vector Regression (SVR) framework for electric
load forecasting that outperforms the industry standard. The SVR model
demonstrates better accuracy across all evaluation metrics that are important
for power system operations. The model has a 54.2\% reduction in Mean Squared
Error (31.91 vs. 69.63), a 33.5\% improvement in Mean Absolute Error, and
performance benefits across other metrics. These improvements show significant
benefits when integrated with power forecasting tools and show that the
approach provides an additional tool for accuracy checking for system planning
and resource allocation in times of need for resource allocation in electric
power systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This work investigates the reasoning and planning capabilities of foundation
models and their scalability in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce
PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to assess these capabilities through a diverse
set of puzzles. PuzzlePlex consists of 15 types of puzzles, including
deterministic and stochastic games of varying difficulty, as well as
single-player and two-player scenarios. The PuzzlePlex framework provides a
comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate
more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we
implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this
benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct
an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings:
instruction-based and code-based. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
their scaling limits. Our findings show that reasoning models outperform others
in instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presents greater
challenges but offers a scalable and efficient alternative. PuzzlePlex enables
targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and
generalization for foundation models.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Understanding and modeling human mobility is central to challenges in
transport planning, sustainable urban design, and public health. Despite
decades of effort, simulating individual mobility remains challenging because
of its complex, context-dependent, and exploratory nature. Here, we present
MobilityGen, a deep generative model that produces realistic mobility
trajectories spanning days to weeks at large spatial scales. By linking
behavioral attributes with environmental context, MobilityGen reproduces key
patterns such as scaling laws for location visits, activity time allocation,
and the coupled evolution of travel mode and destination choices. It reflects
spatio-temporal variability and generates diverse, plausible, and novel
mobility patterns consistent with the built environment. Beyond standard
validation, MobilityGen yields insights not attainable with earlier models,
including how access to urban space varies across travel modes and how
co-presence dynamics shape social exposure and segregation. Our work
establishes a new framework for mobility simulation, paving the way for
fine-grained, data-driven studies of human behavior and its societal
implications.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-07 20:13:49</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Existing decentralized methods for multi-agent motion planning lack formal,
infinite-horizon safety guarantees, especially for communication-constrained
systems. We present R3R, to our knowledge the first decentralized and
asynchronous framework for multi-agent motion planning under distance-based
communication constraints with infinite-horizon safety guarantees for systems
of nonlinear agents. R3R's novelty lies in combining our gatekeeper safety
framework with a geometric constraint called R-Boundedness, which together
establish a formal link between an agent's communication radius and its ability
to plan safely. We constrain trajectories to within a fixed planning radius
that is a function of the agent's communication radius, which enables
trajectories to be shown provably safe for all time, using only local
information. Our algorithm is fully asynchronous, and ensures the forward
invariance of these guarantees even in time-varying networks where agents
asynchronously join, leave, and replan. We validate our approach in simulations
of up to 128 Dubins vehicles, demonstrating 100% safety in dense, obstacle rich
scenarios. Our results demonstrate that R3R's performance scales with agent
density rather than problem size, providing a practical solution for scalable
and provably safe multi-agent systems.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-07 19:34:24</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We investigate the impact of missing input data on the construction of
second-generation Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) variables, which enable data
analysis for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). TDI relies on the
introduction of precise time delays into the raw interferometric data streams
before they are combined to suppress otherwise dominant laser phase noise. We
show that a single missing sample, corresponding to 0.25 s of data, will result
in an effective data gap of approximately 90 s in the second-generation TDI
output if further measures are not taken. This additional gap is largely
independent of the initial gap duration, but increases linearly with the order
of the fractional-delay filter used for the computations. For a realistic gap
scenario, incorporating both planned and unplanned data interruptions
consistent with a target duty cycle of ~84%, we find that frequent,
short-duration gaps (e.g., a total of 1000 per year, each of which have short
durations ~ 100 s) could result in an additional loss in the TDI variables of
about one day per year corresponding to a ~0.3% reduction in duty cycle. This
amounts to a loss of approximately one day of LISA data suitable for the
global-fit per year.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-07 18:12:29</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Planning safe trajectories under model uncertainty is a fundamental
challenge. Robust planning ensures safety by considering worst-case
realizations, yet ignores uncertainty reduction and leads to overly
conservative behavior. Actively reducing uncertainty on-the-fly during a
nominal mission defines the dual control problem. Most approaches address this
by adding a weighted exploration term to the cost, tuned to trade off the
nominal objective and uncertainty reduction, but without formal consideration
of when exploration is beneficial. Moreover, safety is enforced in some methods
but not in others. We propose a framework that integrates robust planning with
active exploration under formal guarantees as follows: The key innovation and
contribution is that exploration is pursued only when it provides a verifiable
improvement without compromising safety. To achieve this, we utilize our
earlier work on gatekeeper as an architecture for safety verification, and
extend it so that it generates both safe and informative trajectories that
reduce uncertainty and the cost of the mission, or keep it within a
user-defined budget. The methodology is evaluated via simulation case studies
on the online dual control of a quadrotor under parametric uncertainty.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,

<p class='card-text'>Post-merger integration states unique challenges for professionals
responsible for information system integration aimed on alignment and
combination diverse system architectures of merging organizations. Although the
theoretical and practical guidance exists for post-merger integration on the
business level, there is a significant gap in training for information system
integration in this context. In prior research specific methods AMILI (Support
method for informed decision identification) and AMILP (Support method for
informed decision-making) were introduced for the support of information system
integration decisions in the post-merger integration. But during the practical
application was reported high learning curve and low learner motivation. This
paper explores how game-based learning design can address these limitations by
transforming static method training into engaging learning experience. The
study analyzes foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation
models, and serious game design frameworks to identify the essential
requirements for a game-based learning design framework tailored to information
system integration in post-merger integration. Requirements are structured in
two components: the transformation process and resulting learning experience.
The paper concludes with a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed
framework through iterative design and real-world validation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Robotic pollination offers a promising alternative to manual labor and
bumblebee-assisted methods in controlled agriculture, where wind-driven
pollination is absent and regulatory restrictions limit the use of commercial
pollinators. In this work, we present and validate a vision-guided robotic
framework that uses data from an end-effector mounted RGB-D sensor and combines
3D plant reconstruction, targeted grasp planning, and physics-based vibration
modeling to enable precise pollination. First, the plant is reconstructed in 3D
and registered to the robot coordinate frame to identify obstacle-free grasp
poses along the main stem. Second, a discrete elastic rod model predicts the
relationship between actuation parameters and flower dynamics, guiding the
selection of optimal pollination strategies. Finally, a manipulator with soft
grippers grasps the stem and applies controlled vibrations to induce pollen
release. End-to-end experiments demonstrate a 92.5\% main-stem grasping success
rate, and simulation-guided optimization of vibration parameters further
validates the feasibility of our approach, ensuring that the robot can safely
and effectively perform pollination without damaging the flower. To our
knowledge, this is the first robotic system to jointly integrate vision-based

the DISTANT (Distant Transmission and Steering Systems) design, a novel
approach for relocating rover traction and steering actuators from
wheel-mounted positions to a thermally protected warm box within the rover

maintaining all motorisation within the protected environment. The design meets

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-07 13:22:27</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Phylogenetic trees represent certain species and their likely ancestors. In
such a tree, present-day species are leaves and an edge from u to v indicates
that u is an ancestor of v. Weights on these edges indicate the phylogenetic
distance. The phylogenetic diversity (PD) of a set of species A is the total
weight of edges that are on any path between the root of the phylogenetic tree
and a species in A. Selecting a small set of species that maximizes
phylogenetic diversity for a given phylogenetic tree is an essential task in
preservation planning, where limited resources naturally prevent saving all
species. An optimal solution can be found with a greedy algorithm [Steel,
Systematic Biology, 2005; Pardi and Goldman, PLoS Genetics, 2005]. However,
when a food web representing predator-prey relationships is given, finding a
set of species that optimizes phylogenetic diversity subject to the condition
that each saved species should be able to find food among the preserved species
is NP-hard [Spillner et al., IEEE/ACM, 2008]. We present a generalization of
this problem, where, inspired by biological considerations, the food web has
weighted edges to represent the importance of predator-prey relationships. We
show that this version is NP-hard even when both structures, the food web and
the phylogenetic tree, are stars. To cope with this intractability, we proceed
in two directions. Firstly, we study special cases where a species can only
survive if a given fraction of its prey is preserved. Secondly, we analyze
these problems through the lens of parameterized complexity. Our results
include that finding a solution is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to
the vertex cover number of the food web, assuming the phylogenetic tree is a
star.</p>
