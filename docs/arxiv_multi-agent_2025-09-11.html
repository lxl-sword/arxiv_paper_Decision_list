  games via Population-Based Training</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Mingrui Lv, Hangzhi Liu, Zhi Luo, Hongjie Zhang, Jie Ou</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant progress
in solving complex multi-player games through self-play. However, training
effective adversarial policies requires millions of experience samples and
substantial computational resources. Moreover, these policies lack
interpretability, hindering their practical deployment. Recently, researchers
have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
programmatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based
policies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.
Inspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating
programmatic policies in multi-player games. PolicyEvolve significantly reduces
reliance on manually crafted policy code, achieving high-performance policies
with minimal environmental interactions. The framework comprises four modules:
Global Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool
preserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool
stores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently
high-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The
Policy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top
three policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the
current iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy
using feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited
into the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves
a sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it
is integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction
data from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes
directional improvements to guide the Policy Planner</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-05 01:03:51</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Can we build efficient Quantum Error Correction (QEC) that adapts on the fly
to time-varying noise? In this work we say yes, and show how. We present a two
level framework based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) that learns to correct
even non-stationary errors from scratch. At the first level we take advantage
of model-free Multi-Agent RL (MARL) to automatically discover full QEC cycle --
logical state encoding, stabilizer measurements, and recovery -- without any
prior system knowledge, relying only on orthogonality conditions. Leveraging
the stabilizer formalism, we demonstrate that our MARL framework can discover
novel QEC codes tailored for multi-level quantum architectures. At the second
level we introduce BRAVE (Bandit Retraining for Adaptive Variational Error
correction), an efficient algorithm that tunes the variational layer on the fly
to change the physical basis of the errors, adapting the QEC code to
time-varying noise while minimizing computational overhead and reducing the
number of retraining steps. By combining our MARL and BRAVE approaches and
testing them on multi-level systems subjected to competing bit- and phase-flip
errors over time across diverse scenarios, we observed an improvement in
logical fidelity by more than an order of magnitude -- under time-dependent
noise channels -- compared to conventional QEC schemes.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-03 23:32:39</h6>
<p class='card-text'>World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.</p>

demonstrated its application potential in modern games. Beginning with
foundational work and progressing to landmark achievements such as AlphaStar in
StarCraft II and OpenAI Five in Dota 2, MARL has proven capable of achieving
superhuman performance across diverse game environments through techniques like

growing impact, a comprehensive review has become increasingly important in
this field. This paper aims to provide a thorough examination of MARL's
application from turn-based two-agent games to real-time multi-agent video
games including popular genres such as Sports games, First-Person Shooter (FPS)
games, Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games and Multiplayer Online Battle Arena

games, including nonstationary, partial observability, sparse rewards, team
coordination, and scalability, and highlight successful implementations in
games like Rocket League, Minecraft, Quake III Arena, StarCraft II, Dota 2,
Honor of Kings, etc. This paper offers insights into MARL in video game AI

<p class='card-text'>In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions
while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to
centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited
observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized
framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the
specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared
server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as
a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global
resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe
reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global
goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate
our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and

presents a novel policy-based Nash Q-learning to directly converge onto a

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-28 14:16:17</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-28 13:47:40</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.</p>

Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,

<p class='card-text'>The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) and agent
systems has heightened interest in mobile GUI agents that can reliably
translate natural language into interface operations. Existing single-agent
approaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although
multi-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress
in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by
inefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To
address these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved
reinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates
MARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one
agent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable
training and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we
provide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem,
and convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled
optimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a
Navigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and
an Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and
low-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strong
capability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential as
a general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cyber defense requires automating defensive decision-making under stealthy,
deceptive, and continuously evolving adversarial strategies. The FlipIt game
provides a foundational framework for modeling interactions between a defender
and an advanced adversary that compromises a system without being immediately
detected. In FlipIt, the attacker and defender compete to control a shared
resource by performing a Flip action and paying a cost. However, the existing
FlipIt frameworks rely on a small number of heuristics or specialized learning
techniques, which can lead to brittleness and the inability to adapt to new

<p class='card-text'>Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a
workload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured
coordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task
allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout
and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing
an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare
workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address
this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines
fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment.
Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired
environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling
impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this
problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with
four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics.
Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to

<p class='card-text'>To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors. While prior work typically
evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward signals, it is
unclear how to infer agent contributions in the absence of any value feedback.
In this work, we investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors
can be extracted solely by analyzing the policy distribution. Inspired by the
phenomenon that intelligent agents tend to pursue convergent instrumental
values, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a method based on
information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each agent's causal
influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment. Specifically, ICVs
measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies by assessing their
decision (un)certainty and preference alignment. By analyzing action effects on
policies and value functions across cooperative and competitive MARL tasks, our
method identifies which agent behaviors are beneficial to team success, either
by fostering deterministic decisions or by preserving flexibility for future

<p class='card-text'>Traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) typically rely on pre-analysis of
the target area, network size, and sensor coverage to determine initial
deployment. This often results in significant overlap to ensure continued
network operation despite sensor energy depletion. With the emergence of Mobile
Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs), issues such as sensor failure and static
coverage limitations can be more effectively addressed through mobility. This
paper proposes a novel deployment strategy in which mobile sensors autonomously
position themselves to maximize area coverage, eliminating the need for
predefined policies. A live camera system, combined with deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), monitors the network by detecting sensor LED indicators and
evaluating real-time coverage. Rewards based on coverage efficiency and sensor
movement are computed at each learning step and shared across the network
through a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework, enabling
decentralized, cooperative sensor control. Key contributions include a
vision-based, low-cost coverage evaluation method; a scalable MARL-DRL
framework for autonomous deployment; and a self-reconfigurable system that
adjusts sensor positioning in response to energy depletion. Compared to
traditional distance-based localization, the proposed method achieves a 26.5%
improvement in coverage, a 32% reduction in energy consumption, and a 22%
decrease in redundancy, extending network lifetime by 45%. This approach
significantly enhances adaptability, energy efficiency, and robustness in
MWSNs, offering a practical deployment solution within the IoT framework.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by
human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in
MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a
self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between
the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing
agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can
be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method
and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes
a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents.
Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a powerful paradigm for solving
cooperative and competitive decision-making problems. While many MARL
benchmarks have been proposed, few combine continuous state and action spaces
with challenging coordination and planning tasks. We introduce CAMAR, a new
MARL benchmark designed explicitly for multi-agent pathfinding in environments
with continuous actions. CAMAR supports cooperative and competitive
interactions between agents and runs efficiently at up to 100,000 environment
steps per second. We also propose a three-tier evaluation protocol to better
track algorithmic progress and enable deeper analysis of performance. In
addition, CAMAR allows the integration of classical planning methods such as
RRT and RRT* into MARL pipelines. We use them as standalone baselines and
combine RRT* with popular MARL algorithms to create hybrid approaches. We
provide a suite of test scenarios and benchmarking tools to ensure

<p class='card-text'>With the rapid advancement of vehicular communication facilities and
autonomous driving technologies, connected vehicle platooning has emerged as a
promising approach to improve traffic efficiency and driving safety. Reliable
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication is critical to achieving efficient
cooperative control. However, in the real-world traffic environment, V2V
communication may suffer from time-varying delay and packet loss, leading to
degraded control performance and even safety risks. To mitigate the adverse
effects of non-ideal communication, this paper proposes a Dynamic Communication
Topology based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DCT-MARL) algorithm for
robust cooperative platoon control. Specifically, the state space is augmented
with historical control action and delay to enhance robustness against
communication delay. To mitigate the impact of packet loss, a multi-key gated
communication mechanism is introduced, which dynamically adjusts the
communication topology based on the correlation between vehicles and their
current communication status. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
DCT-MARL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of string
stability and driving comfort, validating its superior robustness and

<p class='card-text'>This paper proposes a novel method to enhance locomotion for a single
humanoid robot through cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MARL). While most existing methods typically employ single-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL
algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm:
applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single
humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for
single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an
independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global
critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates
training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming
conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances
the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm has
gained significant attention in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and
is the foundation of many recent algorithms. However, decentralized policies
operate under partial observability and often yield suboptimal performance

face scalability challenges as the number of agents increases.
  We propose Centralized Permutation Equivariant (CPE) learning, a centralized
training and execution framework that employs a fully centralized policy to
overcome these limitations. Our approach leverages a novel permutation
equivariant architecture, Global-Local Permutation Equivariant (GLPE) networks,
that is lightweight, scalable, and easy to implement. Experiments show that CPE
integrates seamlessly with both value decomposition and actor-critic methods,

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent self-organizing systems (MASOS) exhibit key characteristics
including scalability, adaptability, flexibility, and robustness, which have
contributed to their extensive application across various fields. However, the
self-organizing nature of MASOS also introduces elements of unpredictability in
their emergent behaviors. This paper focuses on the emergence of dependency
hierarchies during task execution, aiming to understand how such hierarchies
arise from agents' collective pursuit of the joint objective, how they evolve
dynamically, and what factors govern their development. To investigate this
phenomenon, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is employed to train
MASOS for a collaborative box-pushing task. By calculating the gradients of
each agent's actions in relation to the states of other agents, the inter-agent
dependencies are quantified, and the emergence of hierarchies is analyzed
through the aggregation of these dependencies. Our results demonstrate that
hierarchies emerge dynamically as agents work towards a joint objective, with
these hierarchies evolving in response to changing task requirements. Notably,
these dependency hierarchies emerge organically in response to the shared
objective, rather than being a consequence of pre-configured rules or
parameters that can be fine-tuned to achieve specific results. Furthermore, the
emergence of hierarchies is influenced by the task environment and network
initialization conditions. Additionally, hierarchies in MASOS emerge from the
dynamic interplay between agents' "Talent" and "Effort" within the
"Environment." "Talent" determines an agent's initial influence on collective
decision-making, while continuous "Effort" within the "Environment" enables
agents to shift their roles and positions within the system.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In multi-agent systems, the safe and reliable execution of tasks often
depends on agents correctly coordinating their actions. However, in real-world
deployments, failures of computational components are inevitable, presenting a
critical challenge: ensuring that multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
policies remain effective even when some agents malfunction. We propose the
Multi-Agent Robust Training Algorithm (MARTA), a plug-and-play framework for
training MARL agents to be resilient to potentially severe faults. MARTA
operates in cooperative multi-agent settings where agents may lose the ability
to execute their intended actions. It learns to identify failure scenarios that
are especially detrimental to system performance and equips agents with
strategies to mitigate their impact. At the heart of MARTA is a novel
adversarial Markov game in which an adversary -- modelled via \emph{Markov
switching controls} -- learns to disable agents in high-risk state regions,
while the remaining agents are trained to \emph{jointly} best-respond to such
targeted malfunctions. To ensure practicality, MARTA enforces a malfunction
budget, constraining the adversary to a fixed number of failures and learning
robust policies accordingly. We provide theoretical guarantees that MARTA
converges to a Markov perfect equilibrium, ensuring agents optimally counteract
worst-case faults. Empirically, we show that MARTA achieves state-of-the-art
fault-tolerant performance across benchmark environments, including Multi-Agent

<p class='card-text'>Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) represent a promising technology

However, it encounters significant challenges including harsh communication
environments, limited energy supply, and restricted signal transmission. This
paper aims to provide efficient and reliable communication in underwater

scheduling of communication links and adjusting transmission parameters (e.g.,
transmit power and transmission rate). The efficient and reliable communication
multi-objective optimization problem (ERCMOP) is formulated as a decentralized
partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). A Traffic Load-Aware
Resource Management (TARM) strategy based on deep multi-agent reinforcement

<p class='card-text'>Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) stand as promising technologies
facilitating diverse underwater applications. However, the major design issues
of the considered system are the severely limited energy supply and unexpected

Therefore, we formulate a FER-communication optimization problem (FERCOP) and

<p class='card-text'>This paper investigates the fair-effective communication and robustness in
imperfect and energy-constrained underwater acoustic sensor networks
(IC-UASNs). Specifically, we investigate the impact of unexpected node
malfunctions on the network performance under the time-varying acoustic
channels. Each node is expected to satisfy Quality of Service (QoS)
requirements. However, achieving individual QoS requirements may interfere with
other concurrent communications. Underwater nodes rely excessively on the
rationality of other underwater nodes when guided by fully cooperative
approaches, making it difficult to seek a trade-off between individual QoS and
global fair-effective communications under imperfect conditions. Therefore,
this paper presents a SEmi-COoperative Power Allocation approach (SECOPA) that
achieves fair-effective communication and robustness in IC-UASNs. The approach
is distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and the
objectives are twofold. On the one hand, each intelligent node individually

fairness across the devices. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) approaches with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE)
