<p class='card-text'>Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best
viewed as videos at https://andrewsonga.github.io/gvs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We present a framework for uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools

constructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas,including descriptions,
arguments, and output payloads, using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis. In
parallel, we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and
SOPs, which is then fused with the tool graph. To generate exemplar plans, we
adopt a deep-sparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool

unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan

<p class='card-text'>In this work, we present a hierarchical framework designed to support robotic
inspection under environment uncertainty. By leveraging a known environment
model, existing methods plan and safely track inspection routes to visit points
of interest. However, discrepancies between the model and actual site
conditions, caused by either natural or human activities, can alter the surface
morphology or introduce path obstructions. To address this challenge, the
proposed framework divides the inspection task into: (a) generating the initial
global view-plan for region of interests based on a historical map and (b)
local view replanning to adapt to the current morphology of the inspection
scene. The proposed hierarchy preserves global coverage objectives while
enabling reactive adaptation to the local surface morphology. This enables the
local autonomy to remain robust against environment uncertainty and complete
the inspection tasks. We validate the approach through deployments in
real-world subterranean mines using quadrupedal robot.</p>

  Wireless Networks</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-28 15:45:15</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Despite the popularity of reinforcement learning (RL) in wireless networks,
existing approaches that rely on model-free RL (MFRL) and model-based RL (MBRL)
are data inefficient and short-sighted. Such RL-based solutions cannot
generalize to novel network states since they capture only statistical patterns
rather than the underlying physics and logic from wireless data. These
limitations become particularly challenging in complex wireless networks with
high dynamics and long-term planning requirements. To address these
limitations, in this paper, a novel dual-mind world model-based learning
framework is proposed with the goal of optimizing completeness-weighted age of
information (CAoI) in a challenging mmWave V2X scenario. Inspired by cognitive
psychology, the proposed dual-mind world model encompasses a pattern-driven
System 1 component and a logic-driven System 2 component to learn dynamics and
logic of the wireless network, and to provide long-term link scheduling over
reliable imagined trajectories. Link scheduling is learned through end-to-end
differentiable imagined trajectories with logical consistency over an extended
horizon rather than relying on wireless data obtained from environment
interactions. Moreover, through imagination rollouts, the proposed world model
can jointly reason network states and plan link scheduling. During intervals
without observations, the proposed method remains capable of making efficient
decisions. Extensive experiments are conducted on a realistic simulator based
on Sionna with real-world physical channel, ray-tracing, and scene objects with
material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model
achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency and achieves strong
generalization and adaptation to unseen environments, compared to the
state-of-the-art RL baselines, and the world model approach with only System 1.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-28 15:27:26</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) generalizes many real-world multi-robot
scheduling and routing tasks that occur in autonomous mobility, aerial
logistics, and surveillance applications. While many flavors of the TOP exist
for planning in multi-robot systems, they assume that all the robots cooperate
toward a single objective; thus, they do not extend to settings where the
robots compete in reward-scarce environments. We propose Stochastic
Prize-Collecting Games (SPCG) as an extension of the TOP to plan in the
presence of self-interested robots operating on a graph, under energy
constraints and stochastic transitions. A theoretical study on complete and
star graphs establishes that there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs
that coincides with the optimal routing solution of an equivalent TOP given a
rank-based conflict resolution rule. This work proposes two algorithms: Ordinal
Rank Search (ORS) to obtain the ''ordinal rank'' --one's effective rank in
temporarily-formed local neighborhoods during the games' stages, and Fictitious
Ordinal Response Learning (FORL) to obtain best-response policies against one's
senior-rank opponents. Empirical evaluations conducted on road networks and
synthetic graphs under both dynamic and stationary prize distributions show
that 1) the state-aliasing induced by OR-conditioning enables learning policies
that scale more efficiently to large team sizes than those trained with the
global index, and 2) Policies trained with FORL generalize better to imbalanced
prize distributions than those with other multi-agent training methods.
Finally, the learned policies in the SPCG achieved between 87% and 95%
optimality compared to an equivalent TOP solution obtained by mixed-integer
linear programming.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-28 15:26:20</h6>
<p class='card-text'>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad
delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.
It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and
Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our
framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and
broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project

<p class='card-text'>This article investigates the fundamental factors influencing the rate and
manner of Electoral participation with an economic model-based approach. In
this study, the structural parameters affecting people's decision making are
divided into two categories. The first category includes general topics such as
economic and livelihood status, cultural factors and, also, psychological
variables. In this section, given that voters are analyzed within the context
of consumer behavior theory, inflation and unemployment are considered as the
most important economic factors. The second group of factors focuses more on
the type of voting, with emphasis on government performance. Since the
incumbent government and its supportive voters are in a game with two Nash
equilibrium, and also because the voters in most cases are retrospect, the
government seeks to keep its position by a deliberate change in economic
factors, especially inflation and unemployment rates. Finally, to better
understand the issue, a hypothetical example is presented and analyzed in a
developing country in the form of a state-owned populist employment plan.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Running data analytics queries on serverless (FaaS) workers has been shown to
be cost- and performance-efficient for a variety of real-world scenarios,
including intermittent query arrival patterns, sudden load spikes and
management challenges that afflict managed VM clusters. Alas, existing
serverless data analytics works focus primarily on the serverless execution
engine and assume the existence of a "good" query execution plan or rely on
user guidance to construct such a plan. Meanwhile, even simple analytics
queries on serverless have a huge space of possible plans, with vast
differences in both performance and cost among plans.
  This paper introduces Odyssey, an end-to-end serverless-native data analytics
pipeline that integrates a query planner, cost model and execution engine.
Odyssey automatically generates and evaluates serverless query plans, utilizing
state space pruning heuristics and a novel search algorithm to identify
Pareto-optimal plans that balance cost and performance with low latency even
for complex queries. Our evaluations demonstrate that Odyssey accurately
predicts both monetary cost and latency, and consistently outperforms AWS

  Network-Wide Geometric Approach Using Gromov-Wasserstein</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-28 11:15:59</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Urban transportation networks are inherently vulnerable to disruptions that
affect connectivity and passenger mobility. Traditional graph_theoretic
metrics, such as betweenness and degree centrality, offer insights into local
network structure but often fail to capture global structural distortions
resulting from link failures. On the other hand, global indices, such as those
based on spectral analysis of the networks graph, fail in identifying critical
elements. This study proposes to quantify the structural modifications implied
by the disruption of single elements in a transportation network through the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Specifically, we iteratively remove one single
edge from the original network to simulate a disruptive event and then compute
the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between the original network and the disrupted
one. Finally, edges are ranked depending on the observed Gromov-Wasserstein
distance: the higher the value of the distance, the more critical the edge is
in terms. Two transportation networks from Berlin are considered in the
experiments, namely Berlin Friedrichshain Center (BFC) and Berlin Tiergarten
(BT). Results reveal that Gromov-Wasserstein is largely uncorrelated with edge
betweenness (rho<0.1), proving its ability to capture vulnerability aspects
overlooked by local network measures. Moreover, Gromov-Wasserstein exhibits an
almost perfect correlation (rho=0.9999) against a proxy measure of the
transportation service level, that is, the increase in the maximum shortest
path. As a result, the Gromov-Wasserstein distance can be used to rank edges
depending on their criticality with respect to their individual impact on the
overall infrastructure and level, allowing for prioritizing maintenance,
emergency planning, and enhancing the resilience of the urban transport
network.</p>

mathematical model of the problem, we prove that the feasible region of this

bound-tightening technique which allows us to derive the minimum and maximum
element of the lattice, or establish that the feasible region is empty. We
prove the exactness of a convex relaxation of the non-convex problem, obtained
by replacing all constraints with the lower and upper bounds for the variables
corresponding to the minimum and maximum elements of the lattice, respectively.
After proving some properties of optimal solutions of the convex relaxation, we

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-28 09:59:25</h6>
<p class='card-text'>As a consequence of the high variability of load demand and renewable
generation, long-term and high-resolution inputs are required for power system
expansion planning, making the problem intractable in real-world applications.
Time series aggregation (TSA), which captures representative patterns, reduces
temporal complexity while providing similar planning outputs. However, purely
statistical clustering, even when enhanced with predefined ``extremes'', can
overlook system-specific critical operating conditions, making it unreliable
across real-world systems. Therefore, this paper links TSA accuracy on specific
system operation and final solution quality, which becomes a practical bound
with mean-based TSA approaches. It is observed that the distribution of
operational errors is highly imbalanced, such that a few representatives
dominate the total error. This paper proposes an adaptive clustering strategy
based on feedback enhancement of TSA that iteratively identifies
poor-performing representatives with high operational error and re-clusters
only their associated periods. A study shows that the feedback enhancement
improves the decision error and tighten the bound significantly compared with
the plain mean-based clustering method, offering a diagnostic for TSA quality,
while balancing the computational effort with solution accuracy.</p>

essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer-like diseases.
Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented
limited generalizability, robustness, and inability to handle uncertainty,
which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper
introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the
Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module leveraging convolutional layers and fuzzy
logic. This module enhances the segmentation performance by identifying local
and global features while minimizing the uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity in
boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class
imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and
boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated.
Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available
datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, and ACDC.
Extensive experiments and visual studies show CLFSeg surpasses the existing
SOTA performance and focuses on relevant regions of interest in anatomical

<p class='card-text'>Motion planning is a critical component of autonomous vehicle decision-making
systems, directly determining trajectory safety and driving efficiency. While
deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities, existing methods
remain confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in
planning.
  Through systematic analysis, we discover that vehicular trajectory
distributions and history-future correlations demonstrate remarkable
consistency across different datasets. Based on these findings, we propose
UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration
in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified
cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations.
  First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates
history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical
trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset
planning guidance.
  Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust
history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical
trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures
the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making
the planning knowledge safely transferable. Third, the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D)
paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors
during training for robust learning, while enabling full prior utilization

  Consistency</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain
bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods
accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods
ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance,
leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating
inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce
Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a
consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion
trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future
directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation
steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific
error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by
identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality
refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX
with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.</p>

<p class='card-text'>End-to-end autonomous driving maps raw sensor inputs directly into
ego-vehicle trajectories to avoid cascading errors from perception modules and
to leverage rich semantic cues. Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation
Learning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and
covariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning
(RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is
typically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and
maps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We
introduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory
Scoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs
without losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of
our knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only
learning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data.
ZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive
Policy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable
actions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three
benchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop
planning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM
(simulated closed-loop driving). Specifically, ZTRS achieves the
state-of-the-art result on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on
HUGSIM. Code will be available at https://github.com/woxihuanjiangguo/ZTRS.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The design of an indigenous Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS) is
receiving growing attention due to the surge in planned lunar missions and the
limited accessibility of Earth-based Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
in the cislunar environment. Several studies have explored LNSS architecture
using geometric analysis in both near and distant lunar orbits. The existing
LNSS optimization efforts have primarily focused on global lunar coverage using
analytical station-keeping models with low accuracy. Furthermore, current south
pole-focused research is restricted to Elliptical Lunar Frozen Orbits (ELFOs)
and lacks comprehensive optimization approach. Additionally, integration with
Earth GNSS systems for ephemeris computation and time synchronization has not
been adequately addressed in prior studies. In this work, we present a
comprehensive LNSS mission design framework based on evolutionary
multi-objective optimization integrated with a high-fidelity numerical lunar
orbit propagation model. The optimization simultaneously considers navigation
performance in the lunar south pole region, semi-analytical continuous
station-keeping maneuver model for realistic dV estimate, and GPS-LNSS
integration analysis parameters. The resulting Pareto front offers a diverse
set of LNSS configurations that balance coverage, accuracy, and dV
requirements. Notably, the optimization identifies diverse non-frozen
elliptical orbit solutions that achieve over 90% south pole coverage with
acceptable navigation accuracy using as few as six satellites and dV of less
than 0.4 km/s per satellite per year. This represents a significant reduction
in constellation size compared to previous studies, offering a cost-effective
yet operationally efficient solution for future LNSS missions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>With the surge of domestic tourism in India and the influence of social media
on young tourists, this paper aims to address the research question on how
"social return" - responses received on social media sharing - of recent trip
details can influence decision-making for short-term future travels. The paper
develops a multi-model framework to build a predictive machine learning model
that establishes a relationship between a traveler's social return, various
social media usage, trip-related factors, and her future trip-planning
behavior. The primary data was collected via a survey from Indian tourists.
After data cleaning, the imbalance in the data was addressed using a robust
oversampling method, and the reliability of the predictive model was ensured by
applying a Monte Carlo cross-validation technique. The results suggest at least
75% overall accuracy in predicting the influence of social return on changing
the future trip plan. Moreover, the model fit results provide crucial practical
implications for the domestic tourism sector in India with future research

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in legged robot locomotion have facilitated traversal
over increasingly complex terrains. Despite this progress, many existing
approaches rely on end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which poses
limitations in terms of safety and interpretability, especially when
generalizing to novel terrains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VOCALoco, a modular skill-selection framework that dynamically adapts
locomotion strategies based on perceptual input. Given a set of pre-trained
locomotion policies, VOCALoco evaluates their viability and energy-consumption
by predicting both the safety of execution and the anticipated cost of
transport over a fixed planning horizon. This joint assessment enables the
selection of policies that are both safe and energy-efficient, given the
observed local terrain. We evaluate our approach on staircase locomotion tasks,
demonstrating its performance in both simulated and real-world scenarios using
a quadrupedal robot. Empirical results show that VOCALoco achieves improved
robustness and safety during stair ascent and descent compared to a
conventional end-to-end DRL policy</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-28 01:51:23</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains
a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the
limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel
method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to
predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and
test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes
across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel
tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30
AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and
trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression
models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches,
were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best
performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of
the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics
capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and
trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides
a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain
Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port
management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept
presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with
differing operational and environmental conditions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Allocating resources in a distributed environment is a fundamental challenge.
In this paper, we analyze the scheduling and placement of virtual machines
(VMs) in the cloud platform of SAP, the world's largest enterprise resource
planning software vendor. Based on data from roughly 1,800 hypervisors and
48,000 VMs within a 30-day observation period, we highlight potential
improvements for workload management. The data was measured through
observability tooling that tracks resource usage and performance metrics across
the entire infrastructure. In contrast to existing datasets, ours uniquely
offers fine-grained time-series telemetry data of fully virtualized
enterprise-level workloads from both long-running and memory-intensive SAP
S/4HANA and diverse, general-purpose applications. Our key findings include
several suboptimal scheduling situations, such as CPU resource contention
exceeding 40%, CPU ready times of up to 220 seconds, significantly imbalanced
compute hosts with a maximum CPU~utilization on intra-building block hosts of
up to 99%, and overprovisioned CPU and memory resources resulting into over 80%
of VMs using less than 70% of the provided resources. Bolstered by these
findings, we derive requirements for the design and implementation of novel
placement and scheduling algorithms and provide guidance to optimize resource
allocations. We make the full dataset used in this study publicly available to
enable data-driven evaluations of scheduling approaches for large-scale cloud

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous drone technology holds significant promise for enhancing search
and rescue operations during evacuations by guiding humans toward safety and
supporting broader emergency response efforts. However, their application in
dynamic, real-time evacuation support remains limited. Existing models often
overlook the psychological and emotional complexity of human behavior under
extreme stress. In real-world fire scenarios, evacuees frequently deviate from
designated safe routes due to panic and uncertainty. To address these
challenges, this paper presents a multi-agent coordination framework in which
autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) assist human evacuees in real-time
by locating, intercepting, and guiding them to safety under uncertain
conditions. We model the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP), where two heterogeneous UAV agents, a high-level rescuer (HLR)
and a low-level rescuer (LLR), coordinate through shared observations and
complementary capabilities. Human behavior is captured using an agent-based
model grounded in empirical psychology, where panic dynamically affects
decision-making and movement in response to environmental stimuli. The
environment features stochastic fire spread, unknown evacuee locations, and
limited visibility, requiring UAVs to plan over long horizons to search for
humans and adapt in real-time. Our framework employs the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm with recurrent policies to enable robust
decision-making in partially observable settings. Simulation results
demonstrate that the UAV team can rapidly locate and intercept evacuees,
significantly reducing the time required for them to reach safety compared to
scenarios without UAV assistance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Speech sound disorder is among the most common communication challenges in
preschool children. Home-based practice is essential for effective therapy and
for acquiring generalization of target sounds, yet sustaining engaging and
consistent practice remains difficult. Existing story-based activities, despite
their potential for sound generalization and educational benefits, are often
underutilized due to limited interactivity. Moreover, many practice tools fail
to sufficiently integrate speech-language pathologists into the process,
resulting in weak alignment with clinical treatment plans. To address these
limitations, we present MORA, an interactive story-based practice system. MORA
introduces three key innovations. First, it embeds target sounds and vocabulary
into dynamic, character-driven conversational narratives, requiring children to
actively produce speech to progress the story, thereby creating natural
opportunities for exposure, repetition, and generalization. Second, it provides
visual cues, explicit instruction, and feedback, allowing children to practice
effectively either independently or with caregivers. Third, it supports an
AI-in-the-loop workflow, enabling SLPs to configure target materials, review
logged speech with phoneme-level scoring, and adapt therapy plans
asynchronously -- bridging the gap between clinic and home practice while
respecting professional expertise. A formative study with six licensed SLPs
informed the system's design rationale, and an expert review with seven SLPs
demonstrated strong alignment with established articulation-based treatments,
as well as potential to enhance children's engagement and literacy.
Furthermore, discussions highlight the design considerations for professional
support and configurability, adaptive and multimodal child interaction, while
highlighting MORA's broader applicability across speech and language disorders.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Exoplanetary systems exhibit a broad range of architectures which, in turn,
enable a variety of dynamical environments. Many of the known planetary systems
do not transit the host star, and so we measure the minimum masses of their
planets, making it difficult to fully assess the dynamical environment within
the system. Astrometry can resolve the mass ambiguity and thus allow a more
complete dynamical analysis of systems to be conducted. Gaia-4 and Gaia-5 are
two such systems, whose study with radial velocities and data from the Gaia
mission revealed that each star harbors a massive planet on a highly eccentric
orbit. In this work, we provide the results of a dynamical analysis of each
system, including calculations of the Habitable Zone (HZ), from which we show
that the presence of the known companions largely exclude the presence of
planets within the HZ. We discuss the diagnostics of potential past
planet-planet scattering events, and the occurrence of similar systems whereby
a giant planet on an eccentric orbit can substantially disrupt orbital
integrity of terrestrial planets. These "wrecking ball" systems have an impact
on the target selection for planned direct imaging missions that seek to
identify potentially habitable environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to model complex optimization
problems in many applications, yet have difficulty guaranteeing solution
optimality and feasibility, despite training on large datasets. Training a NN
as a surrogate optimization solver amounts to estimating a global solution
function that maps varying problem input parameters to the corresponding
optimal solutions. Work in multiparametric programming (mp) has shown that
solutions to quadratic programs (QP) are piece-wise linear functions of the
parameters, and researchers have suggested leveraging this property to model
mp-QP using NN with ReLU activation functions, which also exhibit piecewise
linear behaviour. This paper proposes a NN modeling approach and learning
algorithm that discovers the exact closed-form solution to QP with linear
constraints, by analytically deriving NN model parameters directly from the
problem coefficients without training. Whereas generic DNN cannot guarantee
accuracy outside the training distribution, the closed-form NN model produces
exact solutions for every discovered critical region of the solution function.
To evaluate the closed-form NN model, it was applied to DC optimal power flow
problems in electricity management. In terms of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
optimality and feasibility of solutions, it outperformed a classically trained
DNN and was competitive with, or outperformed, a commercial analytic solver
(Gurobi) at far less computational cost. For a long-range energy planning
problem, it was able to produce optimal and feasible solutions for millions of
input parameters within seconds.</p>
