  Reinforcement and Collective Learning Approach</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Chuhao Qin, Evangelos Pournaras</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Decentralized combinatorial optimization in evolving multi-agent systems
poses significant challenges, requiring agents to balance long-term
decision-making, short-term optimized collective outcomes, while preserving
autonomy of interactive agents under unanticipated changes. Reinforcement
learning offers a way to model sequential decision-making through dynamic
programming to anticipate future environmental changes. However, applying
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to decentralized combinatorial
optimization problems remains an open challenge due to the exponential growth
of the joint state-action space, high communication overhead, and privacy
concerns in centralized training. To address these limitations, this paper
proposes Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning (HRCL), a novel
approach that leverages both MARL and decentralized collective learning based
on a hierarchical framework. Agents take high-level strategies using MARL to
group possible plans for action space reduction and constrain the agent
behavior for Pareto optimality. Meanwhile, the low-level collective learning
layer ensures efficient and decentralized coordinated decisions among agents
with minimal communication. Extensive experiments in a synthetic scenario and
real-world smart city application models, including energy self-management and
drone swarm sensing, demonstrate that HRCL significantly improves performance,
scalability, and adaptability compared to the standalone MARL and collective
learning approaches, achieving a win-win synthesis solution.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Current state-of-the-art autonomous vehicles could face safety-critical
situations when their local sensors are occluded by large nearby objects on the
road. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving has been proposed
as a means of addressing this problem, and one recently introduced framework
for cooperative autonomous driving has further adopted an approach that
incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to integrate cooperative
perception and planning processes. However, despite the potential benefit of
applying graph-of-thoughts reasoning to the MLLM, this idea has not been
considered by previous cooperative autonomous driving research. In this paper,
we propose a novel graph-of-thoughts framework specifically designed for
MLLM-based cooperative autonomous driving. Our graph-of-thoughts includes our
proposed novel ideas of occlusion-aware perception and planning-aware
prediction. We curate the V2V-GoT-QA dataset and develop the V2V-GoT model for
training and testing the cooperative driving graph-of-thoughts. Our
experimental results show that our method outperforms other baselines in
cooperative perception, prediction, and planning tasks.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-22 16:24:17</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit significant limitations in
reliability and transparency, often showing a collapse in reasoning
capabilities when faced with high-complexity, long-horizon tasks. This
"illusion of thinking" is frequently an artifact of non-agentic, black-box
evaluation paradigms that fail to cultivate robust problem-solving processes.
In response, we introduce The STAR-XAI Protocol (Socratic, Transparent,
Agentic, Reasoning - for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence), a novel
methodology for training and operating verifiably reliable AI agents. Our
method reframes the human-AI interaction as a structured, Socratic dialogue,
governed by an explicit and evolving rulebook, the Consciousness Transfer
Package (CTP). Through an interactive Gameplay Cycle that enforces ante-hoc
strategic justification and a state-locking Checksum that prevents error
accumulation, the protocol transforms a powerful but opaque LRM into a
disciplined "Clear Box" agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method
through an exhaustive 25-move case study in the complex strategic game "Caps i
Caps". The agent not only solved the high-complexity puzzle but also
demonstrated Second-Order Agency, identifying flaws in its own
supervisor-approved plans and adapting its core integrity protocols mid-task.
The STAR-XAI Protocol offers a practical pathway to creating AI agents that are
not just high-performing, but also transparent, auditable, and trustworthy by
design.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reliable brain tumor segmentation in MRI is indispensable for treatment
planning and outcome monitoring, yet models trained on curated benchmarks often
fail under domain shifts arising from scanner and protocol variability as well
as population heterogeneity. Such gaps are especially severe in low-resource
and pediatric cohorts, where conventional test-time or source-free adaptation
strategies often suffer from instability and structural inconsistency. We
propose SmaRT, a style-modulated robust test-time adaptation framework that
enables source-free cross-domain generalization. SmaRT integrates style-aware
augmentation to mitigate appearance discrepancies, a dual-branch momentum
strategy for stable pseudo-label refinement, and structural priors enforcing
consistency, integrity, and connectivity. This synergy ensures both adaptation
stability and anatomical fidelity under extreme domain shifts. Extensive
evaluations on sub-Saharan Africa and pediatric glioma datasets show that SmaRT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with notable gains in Dice
accuracy and boundary precision. Overall, SmaRT bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and equitable clinical applicability, supporting robust
deployment of MRI-based neuro-oncology tools in diverse clinical environments.

<p class='card-text'>Extracting individual sentences from a document as evidence or reasoning
steps is commonly done in many NLP tasks. However, extracted sentences often
lack context necessary to make them understood, e.g., coreference and
background information. To this end, we propose a content selection and
planning framework for zero-shot decontextualisation, which determines what
content should be mentioned and in what order for a sentence to be understood
out of context. Specifically, given a potentially ambiguous sentence and its
context, we first segment it into basic semantically-independent units. We then
identify potentially ambiguous units from the given sentence, and extract
relevant units from the context based on their discourse relations. Finally, we
generate a content plan to rewrite the sentence by enriching each ambiguous
unit with its relevant units. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach is competitive for sentence decontextualisation, producing sentences
that exhibit better semantic integrity and discourse coherence, outperforming
existing methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Problem definition: For original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), high-tech
maintenance is a strategic component in after-sales services, involving close
coordination between customers and service engineers. Each customer suggests
several time slots for their maintenance task, from which the OEM must select
one. This decision needs to be made promptly to support customers' planning. At
the end of each day, routes for service engineers are planned to fulfill the
tasks scheduled for the following day. We study this hierarchical and
sequential decision-making problem-the Dynamic Time Slot Assignment Problem
with Commitments and Customer Preferences (DTSAP-CCP)-in this paper.
Methodology/results: Two distinct approaches are proposed: 1) an
attention-based deep reinforcement learning with rollout execution (ADRL-RE)
and 2) a scenario-based planning approach (SBP). The ADRL-RE combines a
well-trained attention-based neural network with a rollout framework for online
trajectory simulation. To support the training, we develop a neural heuristic
solver that provides rapid route planning solutions, enabling efficient
learning in complex combinatorial settings. The SBP approach samples several
scenarios to guide the time slot assignment. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the superiority of ADRL-RE and the stability of SBP compared to both rule-based
and rollout-based approaches. Furthermore, the strong practicality of ADRL-RE
is verified in a case study of after-sales service for large medical equipment.
Implications: This study provides OEMs with practical decision-support tools
for dynamic maintenance scheduling, balancing customer preferences and
operational efficiency. In particular, our ADRL-RE shows strong real-world
potential, supporting timely and customer-aligned maintenance scheduling.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles (SVs) is crucial for
autonomous driving systems to avoid misguided decisions and potential
accidents. However, achieving reliable predictions in highly dynamic and
complex traffic scenarios remains a significant challenge. One of the key
impediments lies in the limited effectiveness of current approaches to capture
the multi-modal behaviors of drivers, which leads to predicted trajectories
that deviate from actual future motions. To address this issue, we propose
SocialTraj, a novel trajectory prediction framework integrating social
psychology principles through social value orientation (SVO). By utilizing
Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate the SVO of SVs, we
obtain the critical social context to infer the future interaction trend. To
ensure modal consistency in predicted behaviors, the estimated SVOs of SVs are
embedded into a conditional denoising diffusion model that aligns generated
trajectories with historical driving styles. Additionally, the planned future
trajectory of the ego vehicle (EV) is explicitly incorporated to enhance
interaction modeling. Extensive experiments on NGSIM and HighD datasets
demonstrate that SocialTraj is capable of adapting to highly dynamic and
interactive scenarios while generating socially compliant and behaviorally
consistent trajectory predictions, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation
studies demonstrate that dynamic SVO estimation and explicit ego-planning
components notably improve prediction accuracy and substantially reduce
inference time.</p>

<p class='card-text'>World models have shown potential in artificial intelligence by predicting
and reasoning about world states beyond direct observations. However, existing
approaches are predominantly evaluated in synthetic environments or constrained
scene settings, limiting their validation in real-world contexts with broad
spatial coverage and complex semantics. Meanwhile, remote sensing applications
urgently require spatial reasoning capabilities for disaster response and urban
planning. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing the first framework for
world modeling in remote sensing. We formulate remote sensing world modeling as
direction-conditioned spatial extrapolation, where models generate semantically
consistent adjacent image tiles given a central observation and directional
instruction. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop RSWISE (Remote Sensing
World-Image Spatial Evaluation), a benchmark containing 1,600 evaluation tasks
across four scenarios: general, flood, urban, and rural. RSWISE combines visual
fidelity assessment with instruction compliance evaluation using GPT-4o as a
semantic judge, ensuring models genuinely perform spatial reasoning rather than
simple replication. Afterwards, we present RemoteBAGEL, a unified multimodal
model fine-tuned on remote sensing data for spatial extrapolation tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RemoteBAGEL consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines on RSWISE.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Construction sites frequently require removing large rocks before excavation
or grading can proceed. Human operators typically extract these boulders using
only standard digging buckets, avoiding time-consuming tool changes to
specialized grippers. This task demands manipulating irregular objects with
unknown geometries in harsh outdoor environments where dust, variable lighting,
and occlusions hinder perception. The excavator must adapt to varying soil
resistance--dragging along hard-packed surfaces or penetrating soft
ground--while coordinating multiple hydraulic joints to secure rocks using a
shovel. Current autonomous excavation focuses on continuous media (soil,
gravel) or uses specialized grippers with detailed geometric planning for
discrete objects. These approaches either cannot handle large irregular rocks
or require impractical tool changes that interrupt workflow. We train a
reinforcement learning policy in simulation using rigid-body dynamics and
analytical soil models. The policy processes sparse LiDAR points (just 20 per
rock) from vision-based segmentation and proprioceptive feedback to control
standard excavator buckets. The learned agent discovers different strategies
based on soil resistance: dragging along the surface in hard soil and
penetrating directly in soft conditions. Field tests on a 12-ton excavator
achieved 70% success across varied rocks (0.4-0.7m) and soil types, compared to
83% for human operators. This demonstrates that standard construction equipment
can learn complex manipulation despite sparse perception and challenging
outdoor conditions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Monitoring the progression of neurodegenerative disease has important
applications in the planning of treatment and the evaluation of future
medications. Whereas much of the state-of-the-art in health monitoring from
speech has been focused on classifying patients versus healthy controls, or
predicting real-world health metrics, we propose here a novel measure of
disease progression: the severity score. This score is derived from a model
trained to minimize what we call the comparator loss. The comparator loss
ensures scores follow an ordering relation, which can be based on diagnosis,
clinically annotated scores, or simply the chronological order of the
recordings. In addition to giving a more detailed picture than a simple
discrete classification, the proposed comparator loss-based system has the
potential to incorporate information from disparate health metrics, which is
critical for making full use of small health-related datasets. We evaluated our
proposed models based on their ability to affirmatively track the progression
of patients with motor neuron disease (MND), the correlation of their output
with clinical annotations such as ALSFRS-R, as well as their ability to

<p class='card-text'>Purpose: Pencil beam scanning proton therapy is sensitive to respiratory
motion, leading to potential dose inhomogeneities due to interplay effects. We
developed and validated a predictive framework to assess interplay and motion
robustness in lung and esophageal cancer patients treated under free-breathing

implemented in the RayStation treatment planning system (TPS) and validated
against an in vivo approach using patient-specific respiratory traces and
machine log files. Both were benchmarked against the Monte Carlo engine FRED.
To demonstrate the methodology, the framework was applied to two clinical cases
treated on the Mevion S250i system without rescanning. Dose accumulation
incorporated respiratory phase, range ($\pm$3 %), and setup ($\pm$5 mm)
uncertainties. Results: Excellent agreement was observed between TPS and FRED
($<$1 % mean dose difference) and between predictive and in vivo models ($<$2 %
across DVH metrics). Cumulative dose distributions for the primary CTV
converged after five fractions, confirming robust delivery. Conclusions: This
automated, clinically integrated framework enables pre-treatment prediction and
in vivo validation of interplay and motion robustness in PBS plans. Preliminary
results support its clinical utility, especially for hypofractionation and

<p class='card-text'>Generating obstacle-free trajectories for robotic manipulators in
unstructured and cluttered environments remains a significant challenge.
Existing motion planning methods often require additional computational effort
to generate the final trajectory by solving kinematic or dynamic equations.
This paper highlights the strong potential of model-free reinforcement learning
methods over model-based approaches for obstacle-free trajectory planning in
joint space. We propose a fast trajectory planning system for manipulators that
combines vision-based path planning in task space with reinforcement
learning-based obstacle avoidance in joint space. We divide the framework into
two key components. The first introduces an innovative vision-based trajectory
planner in task space, leveraging the large-scale fast segment anything (FSA)
model in conjunction with basis spline (B-spline)-optimized kinodynamic path
searching. The second component enhances the proximal policy optimization (PPO)
algorithm by integrating action ensembles (AE) and policy feedback (PF), which
greatly improve precision and stability in goal-reaching and obstacle avoidance
within the joint space. These PPO enhancements increase the algorithm's
adaptability across diverse robotic tasks, ensuring consistent execution of
commands from the first component by the manipulator, while also enhancing both
obstacle avoidance efficiency and reaching accuracy. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of PPO enhancements, as well as
simulation-to-simulation (Sim-to-Sim) and simulation-to-reality (Sim-to-Real)
transfer, in improving model robustness and planner efficiency in complex
scenarios. These enhancements allow the robot to perform obstacle avoidance and
real-time trajectory planning in obstructed environments. Project page

This work focuses on reducing the quantum noise, in the instrument's
observation band of 0.1 to 10 Hz, by employing optical springs and a homodyne
detection scheme. Although detuning 1000\,km long arm cavities was previously
considered ineffective due to quantum state degradation from diffraction
losses, we revisit this problem by formulating a new, rigorous model for
quantum state of light by accounting for the vacuum state mixing as a result of
diffraction losses. This work shows that high sensitivities can be achieved by
employing optimal configurations of optical springs and homodyne detection

strategic alignment with research priorities. Institutional resources provide
critical support for data-intensive projects, facilitate training and
higher-degree student research, enable prototyping and development, and ensure
data sovereignty compliance when required. The analysis shows how these

<p class='card-text'>Agile mapless navigation in cluttered 3D environments poses significant
challenges for autonomous drones. Conventional mapping-planning-control
pipelines incur high computational cost and propagate estimation errors. We
present AERO-MPPI, a fully GPU-accelerated framework that unifies perception

point-cloud representation that rapidly extracts spatially distributed
"anchors" as look-ahead intermediate endpoints, from which we construct
polynomial trajectory guides to explore distinct homotopy path classes. At each
planning step, we run multiple MPPI instances in parallel and evaluate them
with a two-stage multi-objective cost that balances collision avoidance and
goal reaching. Implemented entirely with NVIDIA Warp GPU kernels, AERO-MPPI
achieves real-time onboard operation and mitigates the local-minima failures of
single-MPPI approaches. Extensive simulations in forests, verticals, and
inclines demonstrate sustained reliable flight above 7 m/s, with success rates

<p class='card-text'>Building autonomous agents that perceive and operate graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) like humans has long been a vision in the field of artificial
intelligence. Central to these agents is the capability for GUI interaction,
which involves GUI understanding and planning capabilities. Existing methods
have tried developing GUI agents based on the multi-modal comprehension ability
of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the limited scenario, insufficient
size, and heterogeneous action spaces hinder the progress of building
generalist GUI agents. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes
\textbf{UIPro}, a novel generalist GUI agent trained with extensive
multi-platform and multi-task GUI interaction data, coupled with a unified
action space. We first curate a comprehensive dataset encompassing 20.6 million
GUI understanding tasks to pre-train UIPro, granting it a strong GUI grounding
capability, which is key to downstream GUI agent tasks. Subsequently, we
establish a unified action space to harmonize heterogeneous GUI agent task
datasets and produce a merged dataset to foster the action prediction ability
of UIPro via continued fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate UIPro's
superior performance across multiple GUI task benchmarks on various platforms,
highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate modeling of personalized cardiovascular dynamics is crucial for
non-invasive monitoring and therapy planning. State-of-the-art physics-informed
neural network (PINN) approaches employ deep, multi-branch architectures with
adversarial or contrastive objectives to enforce partial differential equation
constraints. While effective, these enhancements introduce significant training
and implementation complexity, limiting scalability and practical deployment.
We investigate physics-informed neural operator learning models as efficient
supervisory signals for training simplified architectures through knowledge
distillation. Our approach pre-trains a physics-informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet)
on high-fidelity cuffless blood pressure recordings to learn operator mappings
from raw wearable waveforms to beat-to-beat pressure signals under embedded
physics constraints. This pre-trained operator serves as a frozen supervisor in
a lightweight knowledge-distillation pipeline, guiding streamlined base models
that eliminate complex adversarial and contrastive learning components while
maintaining performance. We characterize the role of physics-informed
regularization in operator learning and demonstrate its effectiveness for
supervisory guidance. Through extensive experiments, our operator-supervised
approach achieves performance parity with complex baselines (correlation: 0.766
vs. 0.770, RMSE: 4.452 vs. 4.501), while dramatically reducing architectural
complexity from eight critical hyperparameters to a single regularization
coefficient and decreasing training overhead by 4%. Our results demonstrate
that operator-based supervision effectively replaces intricate multi-component
training strategies, offering a more scalable and interpretable approach to
physiological modeling with reduced implementation burden.</p>

that preparation time was reduced by two orders of magnitude relative to manual

bounded tool access, and dynamic capability selection, enable transparent,

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely heavily on LiDAR sensors for accurate 3D
perception. We show a novel class of low-cost, passive LiDAR spoofing attacks
that exploit mirror-like surfaces to inject or remove objects from an AV's
perception. Using planar mirrors to redirect LiDAR beams, these attacks require
no electronics or custom fabrication and can be deployed in real settings. We
define two adversarial goals: Object Addition Attacks (OAA), which create
phantom obstacles, and Object Removal Attacks (ORA), which conceal real
hazards. We develop geometric optics models, validate them with controlled
outdoor experiments using a commercial LiDAR and an Autoware-equipped vehicle,
and implement a CARLA-based simulation for scalable testing. Experiments show

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-21 17:34:47</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Many potential direct imaging candidates suffer from large orbital period
uncertainties, leading to challenges in accurate predictions of future orbital
positions and imprecise direct imaging measurements of planetary parameters. To
improve the precision in orbital properties, precursor radial velocity (RV)
follow-up observations for selected candidates are essential. This study
examines the impact of three variables on the orbital period uncertainties of
long-period giant planets: the number of future observations, the temporal gap
between past and future data, and the temporal coverage of upcoming
observations. Our simulations indicate that the orbital phases at which future
RV observations are acquired play a significant role in reducing period
uncertainties. Additionally, observing too frequently within a given time frame
adds limited value to the program once a certain number of observations has
been achieved. The temporal gap proves to be the most important factor when
there is no strict end time to the observing campaign. However, if a strict end
time is set, starting observations earlier yields improved reductions in
orbital period uncertainty. These insights offer practical guidance for
planning efficient RV follow-up campaigns to maximize the science yield of
future space-based direct imaging missions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Time series data is a prevalent form of data found in various fields. It
consists of a series of measurements taken over time. Forecasting is a crucial
application of time series models, where future values are predicted based on
historical data. Accurate forecasting is essential for making well-informed
decisions across industries. When it comes to electric vehicles (EVs), precise

denoising autoencoder model (BDM) designed to address time series problems,
focusing on short-term EV charging load prediction. The performance of the
proposed model is evaluated by comparing it with benchmark models like
Transformer, CNN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU. Based on the results of the study, the

<p class='card-text'>The vast majority of US public school districts use school attendance
boundaries to determine which student addresses are assigned to which schools.
Existing work shows how redrawing boundaries can be a powerful policy lever for
increasing access and opportunity for historically disadvantaged groups, even
while maintaining other priorities like minimizing driving distances and
preserving existing social ties between students and families. This study
introduces a multi-objective algorithmic school rezoning framework and applies
it to a large-scale rezoning effort impacting over 50,000 students through an
ongoing researcher-school district partnership. The framework is designed to
incorporate feedback from community members and policymakers, both by deciding
which goals are optimized and also by placing differential ``importance'' on
goals through weights from community surveys. Empirical results reveal the
framework's ability to surface school redistricting plans that simultaneously
advance a number of objectives often thought to be in competition with one
another, including socioeconomic integration, transportation efficiency, and
stable feeder patterns (transitions) between elementary, middle, and high
schools. The paper also highlights how local education policymakers navigate
several practical challenges, like building political will to make change in a
polarized policy climate. The framework is built using open-source tools and
publicly released to support school districts in exploring and implementing new

<p class='card-text'>We propose a system to adapt a user's music to their exercise by aligning
high-energy music segments with intense intervals of the workout. Listening to
music during exercise can boost motivation and performance. However, the
structure of the music may be different from the user's natural phases of rest
and work, causing users to rest longer than needed while waiting for a
motivational section, or lose motivation mid-work if the section ends too soon.
To address this, our system, called RISE, automatically estimates the intense
segments in music and uses component-based music rearrangement techniques to
dynamically extend and shorten different segments of the user's song to fit the
ongoing exercise routine. Our system takes as input the rest and work durations
to guide adaptation. Currently, this is determined either via a pre-defined
plan or manual input during the workout. We evaluated RISE with 12 participants
and compared our system to a non-adaptive music baseline while exercising in
our lab. Participants found our rearrangements keeps intensity estimation
accurate, and many recalled moments when intensity alignment helped them push

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-09-21 13:54:26</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Accurate trajectory prediction and motion planning are crucial for autonomous
driving systems to navigate safely in complex, interactive environments
characterized by multimodal uncertainties. However, current
generation-then-evaluation frameworks typically construct multiple plausible
trajectory hypotheses but ultimately adopt a single most likely outcome,
leading to overconfident decisions and a lack of fallback strategies that are
vital for safety in rare but critical scenarios. Moreover, the usual decoupling
of prediction and planning modules could result in socially inconsistent or
unrealistic joint trajectories, especially in highly interactive traffic. To
address these challenges, we propose a contingency-aware diffusion planner
(CoPlanner), a unified framework that jointly models multi-agent interactive
trajectory generation and contingency-aware motion planning. Specifically, the
pivot-conditioned diffusion mechanism anchors trajectory sampling on a
validated, shared short-term segment to preserve temporal consistency, while
stochastically generating diverse long-horizon branches that capture multimodal
motion evolutions. In parallel, we design a contingency-aware multi-scenario
scoring strategy that evaluates candidate ego trajectories across multiple
plausible long-horizon evolution scenarios, balancing safety, progress, and
comfort. This integrated design preserves feasible fallback options and
enhances robustness under uncertainty, leading to more realistic
interaction-aware planning. Extensive closed-loop experiments on the nuPlan
benchmark demonstrate that CoPlanner consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on both Val14 and Test14 datasets, achieving significant improvements
in safety and comfort under both reactive and non-reactive settings. Code and
model will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Wide-separation lensed quasars (WSLQs) are a rare subclass of strongly lensed
quasars produced by massive galaxy clusters. They provide valuable probes of
dark-matter halos and quasar host galaxies. However, only about ten WSLQ
systems are currently known, which limits further studies. To enlarge the
sample from wide-area surveys, we developed a catalog-based pipeline and
applied it to the CatNorth database, a catalog of quasar candidates constructed
from Gaia DR3. CatNorth contains 1,545,514 quasar candidates with about 90%
purity and a Gaia G-band limiting magnitude of roughly 21. The pipeline has
three stages. First, we identify groups with separations between 10 and 72
arcsec using a HEALPix grid with 25.6 arcsec spacing and a friends-of-friends
search. We then filter by intra-group color and spectral similarity, reducing
the 1,545,514 sources to 14,244 groups while retaining all known, discoverable
WSLQs. Finally, a visual check, guided by image geometry and the presence of
likely foreground lenses, yields the candidate list with quality labels. We
identify 333 new WSLQ candidates with separations from 10 to 56.8 arcsec. Using
available SDSS DR16 and DESI DR1 spectroscopy, we uncover two new candidate
systems; the remaining 331 candidates lack sufficient spectra and are labeled
as 45 grade A, 98 grade B, and 188 grade C. We also compile 29 confirmed dual

deeper imaging to confirm WSLQs among these candidates and enable the related

<p class='card-text'>Landmarks have long played a pivotal role in automated planning, serving as
crucial elements for improving the planning algorithms. The main limitation of
classical landmark extraction methods is their sensitivity to specific planning
tasks. This results in landmarks fully tailored to individual instances,
thereby limiting their applicability across other instances of the same
planning domain. We propose a novel approach that learns landmark relationships
from multiple planning tasks of a planning domain. This leads to the creation
of a \textit{probabilistic lifted ordering graph}, as a structure that captures
weighted abstractions of relationships between parameterized landmarks.
Although these orderings are not 100\% true (they are probabilistic), they can
still be very useful in planning. Next, given a new planning task for that
domain, we instantiate the relationships from that graph to this particular
instance. This instantiation operates in two phases. First, it generates two
graphs: the former instantiating information from the initial state and the
latter from the goal state. Second, it combines these two graphs into one
unified graph by searching equivalences to extract landmark orderings. We
evaluate the precision and recallof the information found by our approach over

<p class='card-text'>The advancement of foundation models fosters new initiatives for policy
learning in achieving safe and efficient autonomous driving. However, a
critical bottleneck lies in the manual engineering of reward functions and
training curricula for complex and dynamic driving tasks, which is a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. To address this problem, we propose
OGR (Orchestrate, Generate, Reflect), a novel automated driving policy learning
framework that leverages vision-language model (VLM)-based multi-agent
collaboration. Our framework capitalizes on advanced reasoning and multimodal
understanding capabilities of VLMs to construct a hierarchical agent system.
Specifically, a centralized orchestrator plans high-level training objectives,
while a generation module employs a two-step analyze-then-generate process for
efficient generation of reward-curriculum pairs. A reflection module then
facilitates iterative optimization based on the online evaluation. Furthermore,
a dedicated memory module endows the VLM agents with the capabilities of
long-term memory. To enhance robustness and diversity of the generation
process, we introduce a parallel generation scheme and a human-in-the-loop
technique for augmentation of the reward observation space. Through efficient
multi-agent cooperation and leveraging rich multimodal information, OGR enables
the online evolution of reinforcement learning policies to acquire
interaction-aware driving skills. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator
demonstrate the superior performance, robust generalizability across distinct

<p class='card-text'>F1Tenth is a widely adopted reduced-scale platform for developing and testing
autonomous racing algorithms, hosting annual competitions worldwide. With high
operating speeds, dynamic environments, and head-to-head interactions,
autonomous racing requires algorithms that diverge from those in classical
autonomous driving. Training such algorithms is particularly challenging: the
need for rapid decision-making at high speeds severely limits model capacity.
To address this, we propose End2Race, a novel end-to-end imitation learning
algorithm designed for head-to-head autonomous racing. End2Race leverages a
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture to capture continuous temporal
dependencies, enabling both short-term responsiveness and long-term strategic
planning. We also adopt a sigmoid-based normalization function that transforms
raw LiDAR scans into spatial pressure tokens, facilitating effective model
training and convergence. The algorithm is extremely efficient, achieving an
inference time of less than 0.5 milliseconds on a consumer-class GPU.
Experiments in the F1Tenth simulator demonstrate that End2Race achieves a 94.2%
safety rate across 2,400 overtaking scenarios, each with an 8-second time
limit, and successfully completes overtakes in 59.2% of cases. This surpasses
previous methods and establishes ours as a leading solution for the F1Tenth
racing testbed. Code is available at
