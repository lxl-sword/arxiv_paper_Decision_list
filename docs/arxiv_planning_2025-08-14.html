<p class='card-text'>Logics for reasoning about knowledge and actions have seen many applications
in various domains of multi-agent systems, including epistemic planning. Change
of knowledge based on observations about the surroundings forms a key aspect in
such planning scenarios. Public Observation Logic (POL) is a variant of public
announcement logic for reasoning about knowledge that gets updated based on
public observations. Each state in an epistemic (Kripke) model is equipped with
a set of expected observations. These states evolve as the expectations get
matched with the actual observations. In this work, we prove that the
satisfiability problem of $\POL$ is 2EXPTIME-complete.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Electric load forecasting is pivotal for power system operation, planning and
decision-making. The rise of smart grids and meters has provided more detailed
and high-quality load data at multiple levels of granularity, from home to bus
and cities. Motivated by similar patterns of loads across different cities in a
province in eastern China, in this paper we focus on the Multi-Region Electric
Load Forecasting (MRELF) problem, targeting accurate short-term load
forecasting for multiple sub-regions within a large region. We identify three
challenges for MRELF, including regional variation, contextual variation, and
temporal variation. To address them, we propose TriForecaster, a new framework
leveraging the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach within a Multi-Task Learning
(MTL) paradigm to overcome these challenges. TriForecaster features RegionMixer
and Context-Time Specializer (CTSpecializer) layers, enabling dynamic
cooperation and specialization of expert models across regional, contextual,
and temporal dimensions. Based on evaluation on four real-world MRELF datasets
with varied granularity, TriForecaster outperforms state-of-the-art models by
achieving an average forecast error reduction of 22.4\%, thereby demonstrating
its flexibility and broad applicability. In particular, the deployment of
TriForecaster on the eForecaster platform in eastern China exemplifies its
practical utility, effectively providing city-level, short-term load forecasts
for 17 cities, supporting a population exceeding 110 million and daily
electricity usage over 100 gigawatt-hours.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks harness the principles of quantum
physics in order to securely transmit cryptographic key material, providing
physical guarantees. These networks require traditional management and
operational components, such as routing information through the network
elements. However, due to the limitations on capacity and the particularities
of information handling in these networks, traditional shortest paths
algorithms for routing perform poorly on both route planning and online
routing, which is counterintuitive. Moreover, due to the scarce resources in
such networks, often the expressed demand cannot be met by any assignment of
routes. To address both the route planning problem and the need for fair
automated suggestions in infeasible cases, we propose to model this problem as
a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem. For the online routing problem, we
showcase that the shortest (available) paths routing strategy performs poorly
in the online setting. Furthermore, we prove that the widest shortest path
routing strategy has a competitive ratio greater or equal than $\frac{1}{2}$,
efficiently addressing both routing modes in QKD networks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-vehicle trajectory planning (MVTP) is one of the key challenges in
multi-robot systems (MRSs) and has broad applications across various fields.
This paper presents ESCoT, an enhanced step-based coordinate trajectory
planning method for multiple car-like robots. ESCoT incorporates two key
strategies: collaborative planning for local robot groups and replanning for
duplicate configurations. These strategies effectively enhance the performance
of step-based MVTP methods. Through extensive experiments, we show that ESCoT
1) in sparse scenarios, significantly improves solution quality compared to
baseline step-based method, achieving up to 70% improvement in typical conflict
scenarios and 34% in randomly generated scenarios, while maintaining high
solving efficiency; and 2) in dense scenarios, outperforms all baseline
methods, maintains a success rate of over 50% even in the most challenging
configurations. The results demonstrate that ESCoT effectively solves MVTP,
further extending the capabilities of step-based methods. Finally, practical
robot tests validate the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Edge General Intelligence (EGI) represents a transformative evolution of edge
computing, where distributed agents possess the capability to perceive, reason,
and act autonomously across diverse, dynamic environments. Central to this
vision are world models, which act as proactive internal simulators that not
only predict but also actively imagine future trajectories, reason under
uncertainty, and plan multi-step actions with foresight. This proactive nature
allows agents to anticipate potential outcomes and optimize decisions ahead of
real-world interactions. While prior works in robotics and gaming have
showcased the potential of world models, their integration into the wireless
edge for EGI remains underexplored. This survey bridges this gap by offering a
comprehensive analysis of how world models can empower agentic artificial
intelligence (AI) systems at the edge. We first examine the architectural
foundations of world models, including latent representation learning, dynamics
modeling, and imagination-based planning. Building on these core capabilities,
we illustrate their proactive applications across EGI scenarios such as
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, the Internet of
Things (IoT) systems, and network functions virtualization, thereby
highlighting how they can enhance optimization under latency, energy, and
privacy constraints. We then explore their synergy with foundation models and
digital twins, positioning world models as the cognitive backbone of EGI.
Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as safety guarantees, efficient
training, and constrained deployment, and outline future research directions.
This survey provides both a conceptual foundation and a practical roadmap for
realizing the next generation of intelligent, autonomous edge systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The manipulation of deformable linear flexures has a wide range of
applications in industry, such as cable routing in automotive manufacturing and
textile production. Cable routing, as a complex multi-stage robot manipulation
scenario, is a challenging task for robot automation. Common parallel
two-finger grippers have the risk of over-squeezing and over-tension when
grasping and guiding cables. In this paper, a novel eagle-inspired fingernail
is designed and mounted on the gripper fingers, which helps with cable grasping
on planar surfaces and in-hand cable guiding operations. Then we present a
single-grasp end-to-end 3D cable routing framework utilizing the proposed
fingernails, instead of the common pick-and-place strategy. Continuous control
is achieved to efficiently manipulate cables through vision-based state
estimation of task configurations and offline trajectory planning based on
motion primitives. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with
a variety of cables and channel slots, significantly outperforming the
pick-and-place manipulation process under equivalent perceptual conditions. Our
reconfigurable task setting and the proposed framework provide a reference for
future cable routing manipulations in 3D space.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The employment of peer supporter workers starting in 2018 was one of the
interventions deployed by National Health Service England as part of its
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination plan. Peers are individuals with relevant
lived experience who educate their communities about the virus and promote
testing and treatment. In this paper, we assess the causal effect of the peers
intervention on HCV patient case-finding, using data on 22 administrative
regions from January 2016 to May 2021. To do this, we develop a Bayesian causal
factor analysis model for count outcomes and ordinal interventions. Our method
provides uncertainty quantification for all causal estimands of interest, gains
efficiency by jointly modelling the intervention assignment process, pre- and
post-intervention outcomes, and provides estimates of both conditional average
and individual treatment effects (ITEs). For ITEs, we propose a copula-based
approach that allows practitioners to perform sensitivity analysis to
assumptions made regarding the joint distribution of potential outcomes, that
are necessary to estimate these quantities. Our analysis suggests that the
introduction of peers led to an increase in HCV patient case-finding. Further,
we found that the effect of the intervention increased with intervention
intensity, and was stronger during the national COVID-19 lockdown.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires
agents to follow natural language instructions through free-form 3D spaces.
Existing VLN-CE approaches typically use a two-stage waypoint planning
framework, where a high-level waypoint predictor generates the navigable
waypoints, and then a navigation planner suggests the intermediate goals in the
high-level action space. However, this two-stage decomposition framework
suffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each
stage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the
quality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations,
we propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE
policy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and
planning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional
diffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future
actions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint
predictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible
instruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in
imitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation
tasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory
augmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy. This
approach significantly improves the policy's robustness and its ability to
recover from error states. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that, even without a waypoint predictor, the proposed method
substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art two-stage waypoint-based
models in terms of navigation performance. Our code is available at:

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in generating robust locomotion
policies for bipedal robots, but often suffers from tedious reward design and
sensitivity to poorly shaped objectives. In this work, we propose a structured
reward shaping framework that leverages model-based trajectory generation and
control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) to guide policy learning. We explore two
model-based planners for generating reference trajectories: a reduced-order
linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model for velocity-conditioned motion planning,
and a precomputed gait library based on hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) using
full-order dynamics. These planners define desired end-effector and joint
trajectories, which are used to construct CLF-based rewards that penalize
tracking error and encourage rapid convergence. This formulation provides
meaningful intermediate rewards, and is straightforward to implement once a
reference is available. Both the reference trajectories and CLF shaping are
used only during training, resulting in a lightweight policy at deployment. We
validate our method both in simulation and through extensive real-world
experiments on a Unitree G1 robot. CLF-RL demonstrates significantly improved
robustness relative to the baseline RL policy and better performance than a
classic tracking reward RL formulation.</p>

future behavior of the UAV, which is expressed as the path plan. Thus,
decision-making in path planning is an enabling technique for deploying
autonomous UAVs in real-world applications. This survey provides an overview of

telescopes: gigaton-sized detectors of astrophysical neutrinos at and above TeV

scientific reach of pairing a muon accelerator source of neutrinos with a

non-standard oscillations of the beam neutrinos as they traverse the earth

<p class='card-text'>Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high

<p class='card-text'>Bulk material handling involves the efficient and precise moving of large
quantities of materials, a core operation in many industries, including cargo
ship unloading, waste sorting, construction, and demolition. These repetitive,
labor-intensive, and safety-critical operations are typically performed using
large hydraulic material handlers equipped with underactuated grippers. In this
work, we present a comprehensive framework for the autonomous execution of
large-scale material handling tasks. The system integrates specialized modules
for environment perception, pile attack point selection, path planning, and
motion control. The main contributions of this work are two reinforcement
learning-based modules: an attack point planner that selects optimal grasping
locations on the material pile to maximize removal efficiency and minimize the
number of scoops, and a robust trajectory following controller that addresses
the precision and safety challenges associated with underactuated grippers in
movement, while utilizing their free-swinging nature to release material
through dynamic throwing. We validate our framework through real-world

on two key tasks: high-throughput bulk pile management and high-precision truck

<p class='card-text'>Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural

a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine

high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is

  Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires increasingly introduce
unusual disturbance on economic activities, which are especially likely to
reshape commercial land use pattern given their sensitive to customer
visitation. However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such
complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under
and following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively
captured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and
calibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for
Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict
both the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block
level under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years.
Guided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory
guides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation
dynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention
module for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a
regularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs
significantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial
land use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19%
improvement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided
modules was further validated through ablation studies. The research
demonstrates that embedding urban theory into commercial land use modeling
models may substantially enhance the capacity to capture its gains and losses.
These advances in commercial land use modeling contribute to land use research
that accounts for cumulative impacts of recurrent disasters and shifts in
economic activity patterns.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-08-12 10:17:12</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Robotic pick-and-place tasks in convenience stores pose challenges due to
dense object arrangements, occlusions, and variations in object properties such
as color, shape, size, and texture. These factors complicate trajectory
planning and grasping. This paper introduces a perception-action pipeline
leveraging annotation-guided visual prompting, where bounding box annotations
identify both pickable objects and placement locations, providing structured
spatial guidance. Instead of traditional step-by-step planning, we employ
Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) as an imitation learning algorithm,
enabling the robotic arm to predict chunked action sequences from human
demonstrations. This facilitates smooth, adaptive, and data-driven
pick-and-place operations. We evaluate our system based on success rate and
visual analysis of grasping behavior, demonstrating improved grasp accuracy and

<p class='card-text'>Route recommendation (RR) is a core task of route planning in the Amap app,
with the goal of recommending the optimal route among candidate routes to
users. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local
quality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for
enhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies.
To achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison
Network (CCN). CCN not only uses query-level features (e.g. user features) and
item-level features (e.g. route features, item embedding) that are common in
traditional recommendations, but also introduces comparison-level features
which describe the non-overlapping segments between different routes to capture
the local quality of routes. The key component Comprehensive Comparison Block
(CCB) in CCN is designed to enable comparisons between routes. CCB includes a
Comprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can
update the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive
comparison. By stacking multiple CCBs, CCN can determine the final scores of
candidate routes and recommend the optimal one to the user. Additionally, since
routes directly affect the costs and risks experienced by users, the RR model
must be interpretable for online deployment. Therefore, we designed an
interpretable pair scoring network to achieve interpretability. Both offline
and online experiments demonstrate that CCN significantly improves RR
performance and exhibits strong interpretability. CCN has been fully deployed
in the Amap app for over a year, providing stable and optimal benefits for
route recommendations.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Social media data presents AI researchers with overlapping obligations under

integrate these regulatory domains, leaving researchers without unified

extended ETL pipelines. Central to PETLP is treating Data Protection Impact
Assessments as living documents that evolve from pre-registration through
dissemination. Through systematic Reddit analysis, we demonstrate how
extraction rights fundamentally differ between qualifying research
organisations (who can invoke DSM Article 3 to override platform restrictions)
and commercial entities (bound by terms of service), whilst GDPR obligations
apply universally. We reveal why true anonymisation remains unachievable for

<p class='card-text'>Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.</p>

coordination and planning for large-scale mobile robot fleets. These models are
trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and
interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses

inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for
multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an
autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual
robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention
between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies
convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full

<p class='card-text'>Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p>

Identifying critical infrastructure constraining the power grid's ability to
meet electricity demand under weather-induced shocks and stressors is essential
for understanding risks and guiding adaptation. We use transfer entropy to
identify predictive pressure points: grid components whose utilization patterns
provide early signals of downstream power shortages. We apply this method to
simulations of New York State's proposed future grid under various
meteorological and technological scenarios, showing that pressure points often
arise from complex, system-wide interactions between generation, transmission,
and demand. While transfer entropy does not support conclusions about
causality, the identified pressure points align with known bottlenecks and
offer insight into failure pathways. Furthermore, these pressure points are not
easily predicted by high-level scenario features alone, underscoring the need

<p class='card-text'>Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.</p>
