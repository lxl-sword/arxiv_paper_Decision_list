  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-14 13:18:13</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Existing asynchronous MARL methods based on MacDec-POMDP typically construct
training trajectory buffers by simply sampling limited and biased data at the
endpoints of macro-actions, and directly apply conventional MARL methods on the
buffers. As a result, these methods lead to an incomplete and inaccurate
representation of the macro-action execution process, along with unsuitable
credit assignments. To solve these problems, the Temporal Macro-action Value
Factorization (ToMacVF) is proposed to achieve fine-grained temporal credit
assignment for macro-action contributions. A centralized training buffer,
called Macro-action Segmented Joint Experience Replay Trajectory (Mac-SJERT),
is designed to incorporate with ToMacVF to collect accurate and complete
macro-action execution information, supporting a more comprehensive and precise
representation of the macro-action process. To ensure principled and
fine-grained asynchronous value factorization, the consistency requirement
between joint and individual macro-action selection called Temporal
Macro-action based IGM (To-Mac-IGM) is formalized, proving that it generalizes
the synchronous cases. Based on To-Mac-IGM, a modularized ToMacVF architecture,
which satisfies CTDE principle, is designed to conveniently integrate previous
value factorization methods. Next, the ToMacVF algorithm is devised as an
implementation of the ToMacVF architecture. Experimental results demonstrate
that, compared to asynchronous baselines, our ToMacVF algorithm not only
achieves optimal performance but also exhibits strong adaptability and
robustness across various asynchronous multi-agent experimental scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown clear effectiveness in
coordinating multiple agents across simulated benchmarks and constrained
scenarios. However, its deployment in real-world multi-agent systems (MAS)
remains limited, primarily due to the complex and dynamic nature of such
environments. These challenges arise from multiple interacting sources of
variability, including fluctuating agent populations, evolving task goals, and
inconsistent execution conditions. Together, these factors demand that MARL
algorithms remain effective under continuously changing system configurations
and operational demands. To better capture and assess this capacity for
adjustment, we introduce the concept of \textit{adaptability} as a unified and
practically grounded lens through which to evaluate the reliability of MARL
algorithms under shifting conditions, broadly referring to any changes in the
environment dynamics that may occur during learning or execution. Centred on
the notion of adaptability, we propose a structured framework comprising three
key dimensions: learning adaptability, policy adaptability, and scenario-driven
adaptability. By adopting this adaptability perspective, we aim to support more
principled assessments of MARL performance beyond narrowly defined benchmarks.
Ultimately, this survey contributes to the development of algorithms that are
better suited for deployment in dynamic, real-world multi-agent systems.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-14 07:16:01</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving
monotonic improvement plays a pivotal role in enhancing performance. The HAPPO
algorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update
scheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS).
However, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing
(ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our
experiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update
scheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to
achieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and
ParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)
algorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$
with the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\phi_{\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived
from Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating
the conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential
policy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC)
as the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to
optimize different Q-value estimations. This provides the required Q-values for
OMQ computation and stable baselines for actor updates. Finally, we implement a
Centralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture that simultaneously
achieves ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function
computation. Experimental results in SMAC and MAMuJoCo environments demonstrate
that OMDPG outperforms various state-of-the-art MARL baselines.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced a new era of permissionless
financial innovation but also led to unprecedented market manipulation. Without
centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and
pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation
detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a
dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies suspicious patterns using
delayed token price reactions as financial indicators.Our method introduces
three innovations: (1) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance
learning stability in sparse-reward and partially observable settings; (2) a
theory-based reward function inspired by rational expectations and information
asymmetry, differentiating price discovery from manipulation noise; and (3) a
multi-modal agent pipeline that integrates LLM-based semantic features, social
graph signals, and on-chain market data for informed decision-making.The
framework is integrated within the Symphony system, a decentralized multi-agent
architecture enabling peer-to-peer agent execution and trust-aware learning
through distributed logs, supporting chain-verifiable evaluation. Symphony
promotes adversarial co-evolution among strategic actors and maintains robust
manipulation detection without centralized oracles, enabling real-time
surveillance across global DeFi ecosystems.Trained on 100,000 real-world
discourse episodes and validated in adversarial simulations, Hide-and-Shill
achieves top performance in detection accuracy and causal attribution. This
work bridges multi-agent systems with financial surveillance, advancing a new

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-12 00:31:15</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In this paper, a novel Three dimensional (3D) positioning framework of fluid
antenna system (FAS)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is developed. In
the proposed framework, a set of controlled UAVs cooperatively estimate the
real-time 3D position of a target UAV. Here, the active UAV transmits a
measurement signal to the passive UAVs via the reflection from the target UAV.
Each passive UAV estimates the distance of the active-target-passive UAV link
and selects an antenna port to share the distance information with the base
station (BS) that calculates the real-time position of the target UAV. As the
target UAV is moving due to its task operation, the controlled UAVs must
optimize their trajectories and select optimal antenna port, aiming to estimate
the real-time position of the target UAV. We formulate this problem as an
optimization problem to minimize the target UAV positioning error via
optimizing the trajectories of all controlled UAVs and antenna port selection
of passive UAVs. Here, an attention-based recurrent multi-agent reinforcement
learning (AR-MARL) scheme is proposed, which enables each controlled UAV to use
the local Q function to determine its trajectory and antenna port while
optimizing the target UAV positioning performance without knowing the
trajectories and antenna port selections of other controlled UAVs. Different
from current MARL methods, the proposed method uses a recurrent neural network
(RNN) that incorporates historical state-action pairs of each controlled UAV,
and an attention mechanism to analyze the importance of these historical
state-action pairs, thus improving the global Q function approximation accuracy
and the target UAV positioning accuracy. Simulation results show that the
proposed AR-MARL scheme can reduce the average positioning error by up to 17.5%
and 58.5% compared to the VD-MARL scheme and the proposed method without FAS.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-09 22:44:26</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-09 17:31:35</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces significant challenges in
task sequencing and curriculum design, particularly for cooperative
coordination scenarios. While curriculum learning has demonstrated success in
single-agent domains, principled approaches for multi-agent coordination remain
limited due to the absence of validated task complexity metrics. This approach
presents a graph-based coordination complexity metric that integrates agent
dependency entropy, spatial interference patterns, and goal overlap analysis to
predict task difficulty in multi-agent environments. The complexity metric
achieves strong empirical validation with rho = 0.952 correlation (p < 0.001)
between predicted complexity and empirical difficulty determined by random
agent performance evaluation. This approach evaluates the curriculum learning
framework using MADDPG across two distinct coordination environments: achieving
56x performance improvement in tight coordination tasks (MultiWalker) and
demonstrating systematic task progression in cooperative navigation (Simple
Spread). Through systematic analysis, coordination tightness emerges as a
predictor of curriculum learning effectiveness, where environments requiring
strict agent interdependence benefit substantially from structured progression.
This approach provides a validated complexity metric for multi-agent curriculum
design and establishes empirical guidelines for multi-robot coordination
applications.</p>

in a multi-cellular network within the context of beyond 5G networks. At each
cell, a base station (BS) operates as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent
that interacts with the surrounding environment to maximize the secrecy rate of
legitimate users in the presence of an eavesdropper. This eavesdropper attempts
to intercept the confidential information shared between the BS and its
authorized users. The DRL agents are deemed to be federated since they only
share their network parameters with a central server and not the private data
of their legitimate users. Two DRL approaches, deep Q-network (DQN) and
Reinforce deep policy gradient (RDPG), are explored and compared. The results
demonstrate that RDPG converges more rapidly than DQN. In addition, we

<p class='card-text'>Multi-task multi-agent reinforcement learning (MT-MARL) has recently gained
attention for its potential to enhance MARL's adaptability across multiple
tasks. However, it is challenging for existing multi-task learning methods to
handle complex problems, as they are unable to handle unrelated tasks and
possess limited knowledge transfer capabilities. In this paper, we propose a
hierarchical approach that efficiently addresses these challenges. The
high-level module utilizes a skill graph, while the low-level module employs a
standard MARL algorithm. Our approach offers two contributions. First, we
consider the MT-MARL problem in the context of unrelated tasks, expanding the
scope of MTRL. Second, the skill graph is used as the upper layer of the
standard hierarchical approach, with training independent of the lower layer,
effectively handling unrelated tasks and enhancing knowledge transfer
capabilities. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate these advantages
and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the latest hierarchical
MAPPO algorithms. Videos and code are available at

<p class='card-text'>Continual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Co-MARL) requires agents to
address catastrophic forgetting issues while learning new coordination policies
with the dynamics team. In this paper, we delve into the core of Co-MARL,
namely Relation Patterns, which refer to agents' general understanding of
interactions. In addition to generality, relation patterns exhibit
task-specificity when mapped to different action spaces. To this end, we
propose a novel method called General Relation Patterns-Guided Task-Specific
Decision-Maker (RPG). In RPG, agents extract relation patterns from dynamic
observation spaces using a relation capturer. These task-agnostic relation
patterns are then mapped to different action spaces via a task-specific
decision-maker generated by a conditional hypernetwork. To combat forgetting,
we further introduce regularization items on both the relation capturer and the
conditional hypernetwork. Results on SMAC and LBF demonstrate that RPG
effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks and

<p class='card-text'>This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured

<p class='card-text'>Intelligent control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) swarms has emerged as
a critical research focus, and it typically requires the swarm to navigate
effectively while avoiding obstacles and achieving continuous coverage over
multiple mission targets. Although traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) approaches offer dynamic adaptability, they are hindered by the
semantic gap in numerical communication and the rigidity of homogeneous role
structures, resulting in poor generalization and limited task scalability.
Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based control frameworks
demonstrate strong semantic reasoning capabilities by leveraging extensive
prior knowledge. However, due to the lack of online learning and over-reliance
on static priors, these works often struggle with effective exploration,
leading to reduced individual potential and overall system performance. To
address these limitations, we propose a Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked
navigation algorithm RALLY. Specifically, we first develop an LLM-driven
semantic decision framework that uses structured natural language for efficient
semantic communication and collaborative reasoning. Afterward, we introduce a
dynamic role-heterogeneity mechanism for adaptive role switching and
personalized decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a Role-value Mixing
Network (RMIX)-based assignment strategy that integrates LLM offline priors
with MARL online policies to enable semi-offline training of role selection
strategies. Experiments in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE)

<p class='card-text'>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm
for increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous
agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training
instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL
called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively
refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves
holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.
Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on
the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO
sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal
benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with
maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve
training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter
adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution
mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to
eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across
general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves
performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller

FIM consists of three core components: (1) identifying CoG state dimensions
based on their stability under agent behavior, (2) designing counterfactual
intrinsic rewards to promote meaningful influence on these dimensions, and (3)
encouraging persistent and synchronized focus through eligibility-trace-based
credit accumulation. These mechanisms enable agents to induce more targeted and

constraints and holistic structural awareness of anatomical regions. Each
contour point is modeled as an autonomous agent that iteratively adjusts its
position to align precisely with the target boundary, enabling adaptation to
blurred edges and intricate morphologies common in medical images. This
iterative adjustment process is optimized by a contour-specific Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, further enhanced with the Entropy Regularization
Adjustment Mechanism (ERAM) which dynamically balance agent exploration with
contour smoothness. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a Mamba-based
policy network featuring a novel Bidirectional Cross-attention Hidden-state
Fusion Mechanism (BCHFM). This mechanism mitigates potential memory confusion
limitations associated with long-range modeling in state space models, thereby
facilitating more accurate inter-agent information exchange and informed
decision-making. Extensive experiments on five diverse medical imaging datasets
demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MARL-MambaContour, highlighting
its potential as an accurate and robust clinical application.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Behavioral diversity in Multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) represents
an emerging and promising research area. Prior work has largely centered on
intra-group behavioral consistency in multi-agent systems, with limited
attention given to behavioral consistency in multi-agent grouping scenarios. In
this paper, we introduce Dual-Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC), a novel MARL
control method designed to explicitly regulate agent behaviors at both
intra-group and inter-group levels. DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups
and dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these
groups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these
groups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group
consistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.
Simultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral
strategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.
Crucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad
applicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in
various grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly
enhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task
specialization, yielding substantial performance improvements. DLBC provides
new ideas for behavioral consistency control of multi-intelligent body systems,
and its potential for application in more complex tasks and dynamic
environments can be further explored in the future.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The evolution of metropolitan cities and the increase in travel demands
impose stringent requirements on traffic assignment methods. Multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches outperform traditional methods in
modeling adaptive routing behavior without requiring explicit system dynamics,
which is beneficial for real-world deployment. However, MARL frameworks face
challenges in scalability and reliability when managing extensive networks with
substantial travel demand, which limiting their practical applicability in
solving large-scale traffic assignment problems. To address these challenges,
this study introduces MARL-OD-DA, a new MARL framework for the traffic
assignment problem, which redefines agents as origin-destination (OD) pair
routers rather than individual travelers, significantly enhancing scalability.
Additionally, a Dirichlet-based action space with action pruning and a reward
function based on the local relative gap are designed to enhance solution
reliability and improve convergence efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that
the proposed MARL framework effectively handles medium-sized networks with
extensive and varied city-level OD demand, surpassing existing MARL methods.
When implemented in the SiouxFalls network, MARL-OD-DA achieves better
assignment solutions in 10 steps, with a relative gap that is 94.99% lower than
that of conventional methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Evaluating intervention effects on multiple outcomes is a central research
goal in a wide range of quantitative sciences. It is thereby common to compare
interventions among each other and with a control across several, potentially
highly correlated, outcome variables. In this context, researchers are
interested in identifying effects at both, the global level (across all outcome
variables) and the local level (for specific variables). At the same time,
potential confounding must be accounted for. This leads to the need for
powerful multiple contrast testing procedures (MCTPs) capable of handling
multivariate outcomes and covariates. Given this background, we propose an
extension of MCTPs within a semiparametric MANCOVA framework that allows
applicability beyond multivariate normality, homoscedasticity, or non-singular
covariance structures. We illustrate our approach by analysing multivariate
psychological intervention data, evaluating joint physiological and
psychological constructs such as heart rate variability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised
Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring,
disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in
multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional
optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making
demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we
investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling
single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations
using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data
storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the
complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By
leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the
training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,
including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can
effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing
non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous
satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy
learning in decentralised EO missions.</p>

impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual
learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce
MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark
tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL
benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks
and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU
acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a
standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL

scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation.
Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-16 17:58:09</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper introduces MARCO (Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning with
Conformal Optimization), a novel hardware-aware framework for efficient neural
architecture search (NAS) targeting resource-constrained edge devices. By
significantly reducing search time and maintaining accuracy under strict
hardware constraints, MARCO bridges the gap between automated DNN design and
CAD for edge AI deployment. MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its
unique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal
Prediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for
deploying deep neural networks. Unlike conventional once-for-all (OFA) supernet
approaches that require extensive pretraining, MARCO decomposes the NAS task
into a hardware configuration agent (HCA) and a Quantization Agent (QA). The
HCA optimizes high-level design parameters, while the QA determines per-layer
bit-widths under strict memory and latency budgets using a shared reward signal
within a centralized-critic, decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm. A key
innovation is the integration of a calibrated CP surrogate model that provides
statistical guarantees (with a user-defined miscoverage rate) to prune
unpromising candidate architectures before incurring the high costs of partial
training or hardware simulation. This early filtering drastically reduces the
search space while ensuring that high-quality designs are retained with a high
probability. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that MARCO achieves a 3-4x reduction in total search time compared
to an OFA baseline while maintaining near-baseline accuracy (within 0.3%).
Furthermore, MARCO also reduces inference latency. Validation on a MAX78000
evaluation board confirms that simulator trends hold in practice, with
simulator estimates deviating from measured values by less than 5%.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-16 05:43:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper develops a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
framework for reinsurance treaty bidding, addressing long-standing
inefficiencies in traditional broker-mediated placement processes. We pose the
core research question: Can autonomous, learning-based bidding systems improve
risk transfer efficiency and outperform conventional pricing approaches in
reinsurance markets?
  In our model, each reinsurer is represented by an adaptive agent that
iteratively refines its bidding strategy within a competitive, partially
observable environment. The simulation explicitly incorporates institutional
frictions including broker intermediation, incumbent advantages, last-look
privileges, and asymmetric access to underwriting information.
  Empirical analysis demonstrates that MARL agents achieve up to 15% higher
underwriting profit, 20% lower tail risk (CVaR), and over 25% improvement in
Sharpe ratios relative to actuarial and heuristic baselines. Sensitivity tests
confirm robustness across hyperparameter settings, and stress testing reveals
strong resilience under simulated catastrophe shocks and capital constraints.
  These findings suggest that MARL offers a viable path toward more
transparent, adaptive, and risk-sensitive reinsurance markets. The proposed
framework contributes to emerging literature at the intersection of algorithmic
market design, strategic bidding, and AI-enabled financial decision-making.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Intelligent transportation systems require connected and automated vehicles
(CAVs) to conduct safe and efficient cooperation with human-driven vehicles
(HVs) in complex real-world traffic environments. However, the inherent
unpredictability of human behaviour, especially at bottlenecks such as highway
on-ramp merging areas, often disrupts traffic flow and compromises system
performance. To address the challenge of cooperative on-ramp merging in
heterogeneous traffic environments, this study proposes a trust-based
multi-agent reinforcement learning (Trust-MARL) framework. At the macro level,
Trust-MARL enhances global traffic efficiency by leveraging inter-agent trust
to improve bottleneck throughput and mitigate traffic shockwave through
emergent group-level coordination. At the micro level, a dynamic trust
mechanism is designed to enable CAVs to adjust their cooperative strategies in
response to real-time behaviors and historical interactions with both HVs and
other CAVs. Furthermore, a trust-triggered game-theoretic decision-making
module is integrated to guide each CAV in adapting its cooperation factor and
executing context-aware lane-changing decisions under safety, comfort, and
efficiency constraints. An extensive set of ablation studies and comparative
experiments validates the effectiveness of the proposed Trust-MARL approach,
demonstrating significant improvements in safety, efficiency, comfort, and
adaptability across varying CAV penetration rates and traffic densities.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) demands principled
mechanisms to align heterogeneous policies while preserving the capacity for
specialized behavior. We introduce a novel consensus framework that defines the
team strategy as the entropic-regularized $p$-Wasserstein barycenter of agents'
joint state--action visitation measures. By augmenting each agent's policy
objective with a soft penalty proportional to its Sinkhorn divergence from this
barycenter, the proposed approach encourages coherent group behavior without
enforcing rigid parameter sharing. We derive an algorithm that alternates
between Sinkhorn-barycenter computation and policy-gradient updates, and we
prove that, under standard Lipschitz and compactness assumptions, the maximal
pairwise policy discrepancy contracts at a geometric rate. Empirical evaluation
on a cooperative navigation case study demonstrates that our OT-barycenter
consensus outperforms an independent learners baseline in convergence speed and
final coordination success.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) have emerged as a promising
solution towards ameliorating urban traffic congestion, with Traffic Signal
Control (TSC) identified as a critical component. Although Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms have shown potential in optimizing TSC
through real-time decision-making, their scalability and effectiveness often
suffer from large-scale and complex environments. Typically, these limitations
primarily stem from a fundamental mismatch between the exponential growth of
the state space driven by the environmental heterogeneities and the limited
modeling capacity of current solutions. To address these issues, this paper
introduces a novel MARL framework that integrates Dynamic Graph Neural Networks
(DGNNs) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), aiming to enhance the
expressiveness of environmental representations and improve agent coordination.
Furthermore, inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture in Large
Language Models (LLMs), a topology-assisted spatial pattern disentangling
(TSD)-enhanced MoE is proposed, which leverages topological signatures to
decouple graph features for specialized processing, thus improving the model's
ability to characterize dynamic and heterogeneous local observations. The TSD
module is also integrated into the policy and value networks of the Multi-agent
Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, further improving
decision-making efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on
real-world traffic scenarios, together with comprehensive theoretical analysis,
validate the superior performance of the proposed framework, highlighting the
model's scalability and effectiveness in addressing the complexities of

<p class='card-text'>In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must adapt to
human-controlled vehicles and other unusual driving situations. This setting
can be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with
full cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as
Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL
tasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable
to generalize to stochastic events. In this paper, we propose a Local State
Attention module to assist the input state representation. By relying on the
self-attention operator, the module is expected to compress the essential
information of nearby agents to resolve the conflict in traffic situations.
Utilizing a simulated highway merging scenario with the priority vehicle as the
unexpected event, our approach is able to prioritize other vehicles'
information to manage the merging process. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in merging efficiency compared to popular baselines, especially in

<p class='card-text'>The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the
division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation
for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing
on multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question
from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited
for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial
setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation
operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on
individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$
task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these
operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for
broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask
what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents
must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such
settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational
paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a
gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified
MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.
Experiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show
that, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes
predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both
validating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in
MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity
delivers a measurable benefit.</p>

underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question:
can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess
a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for
effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is
essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans
