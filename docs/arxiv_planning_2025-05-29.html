<p class='card-text'>Scientific embodied agents play a crucial role in modern laboratories by
automating complex experimental workflows. Compared to typical household
environments, laboratory settings impose significantly higher demands on
perception of physical-chemical transformations and long-horizon planning,
making them an ideal testbed for advancing embodied intelligence. However, its
development has been long hampered by the lack of suitable simulator and
benchmarks. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing LabUtopia, a
comprehensive simulation and benchmarking suite designed to facilitate the
development of generalizable, reasoning-capable embodied agents in laboratory
settings. Specifically, it integrates i) LabSim, a high-fidelity simulator
supporting multi-physics and chemically meaningful interactions; ii) LabScene,
a scalable procedural generator for diverse scientific scenes; and iii)
LabBench, a hierarchical benchmark spanning five levels of complexity from
atomic actions to long-horizon mobile manipulation. LabUtopia supports 30
distinct tasks and includes more than 200 scene and instrument assets, enabling
large-scale training and principled evaluation in high-complexity environments.
We demonstrate that LabUtopia offers a powerful platform for advancing the
integration of perception, planning, and control in scientific-purpose agents
and provides a rigorous testbed for exploring the practical capabilities and
generalization limits of embodied intelligence in future research.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been widely tested
using tools like OpenAI Gym, though many tasks in these environments could also
benefit from hierarchical planning. However, there is a lack of a tool that
enables seamless integration of hierarchical planning with RL. Hierarchical
Domain Definition Language (HDDL), used in classical planning, introduces a
structured approach well-suited for model-based RL to address this gap. To
bridge this integration, we introduce HDDLGym, a Python-based tool that
automatically generates OpenAI Gym environments from HDDL domains and problems.
HDDLGym serves as a link between RL and hierarchical planning, supporting
multi-agent scenarios and enabling collaborative planning among agents. This
paper provides an overview of HDDLGym's design and implementation, highlighting
the challenges and design choices involved in integrating HDDL with the Gym
interface, and applying RL policies to support hierarchical planning. We also
provide detailed instructions and demonstrations for using the HDDLGym
framework, including how to work with existing HDDL domains and problems from
International Planning Competitions, exemplified by the Transport domain.
Additionally, we offer guidance on creating new HDDL domains for multi-agent
scenarios and demonstrate the practical use of HDDLGym in the Overcooked
domain. By leveraging the advantages of HDDL and Gym, HDDLGym aims to be a
valuable tool for studying RL in hierarchical planning, particularly in
multi-agent contexts.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The synthesis of Ohman's VCV sequences with intervocalic plosive consonants
was first achieved 30 years ago using the DRM model. However, this approach
remains primarily acoustic and lacks articulatory constraints. In this study,
the same 75 VCVs are analyzed, but generated with the Maeda model, using
trajectory planning that differentiates vowel-to-vowel transitions from
consonantal influences. Synthetic data exhibit similar characteristics to
Ohman's sequences, including the presence of S-shaped F2 trajectories.
Furthermore, locus equations (LEs) for F2 and F3 are computed from synthetic CV
data to investigate their underlying determinism, leading to a reassessment of
conventional interpretations. The findings indicate that, although articulatory
planning is structured separately for vowel and consonant groups, S-shaped F2
trajectories emerge from a composite mechanism governed by the coordinated
synergy of all articulators.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in world models have revolutionized dynamic environment
simulation, allowing systems to foresee future states and assess potential
actions. In autonomous driving, these capabilities help vehicles anticipate the
behavior of other road users, perform risk-aware planning, accelerate training
in simulation, and adapt to novel scenarios, thereby enhancing safety and
reliability. Current approaches exhibit deficiencies in maintaining robust 3D
geometric consistency or accumulating artifacts during occlusion handling, both
critical for reliable safety assessment in autonomous navigation tasks. To
address this, we introduce GeoDrive, which explicitly integrates robust 3D
geometry conditions into driving world models to enhance spatial understanding
and action controllability. Specifically, we first extract a 3D representation
from the input frame and then obtain its 2D rendering based on the
user-specified ego-car trajectory. To enable dynamic modeling, we propose a
dynamic editing module during training to enhance the renderings by editing the
positions of the vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models in both action accuracy and 3D
spatial awareness, leading to more realistic, adaptable, and reliable scene
modeling for safer autonomous driving. Additionally, our model can generalize
to novel trajectories and offers interactive scene editing capabilities, such
as object editing and object trajectory control.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will enable direct observations
of low-frequency gravitational waves, offering unprecedented insight into
astrophysical and cosmological phenomena. LISA's heterodyne interferometric
measurement system requires phase-locking five of its six onboard lasers with
tunable frequency offsets to ensure that all beatnotes remain within the
metrology system's operational range, despite Doppler-induced frequency shifts.
The selection of these offset frequencies -- collectively forming a frequency
plan -- is a complex optimization problem constrained by the spacecraft's
orbital dynamics and instrument limitations. While previous work established an
algorithmic solution for deriving time-dependent frequency plans, this study
takes a complementary approach by systematically analyzing and cataloging all
possible laser locking configurations. We present an automated method to
explore, validate, and classify viable locking schemes, identifying 36 unique
non-frequency-swapping configurations and 72 additional frequency-swapping
configurations for an arbitrary choice of primary laser. This exhaustive
classification provides a foundation for frequency planning across the full
range of operational scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>RHIC and LHC plan to inject $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei with a focus to investigate
collectivity and the origin of quark-gluon plasma signatures in small collision
systems. $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei is known to possess clusters of $\alpha$-particles
($^{4}\rm He$) inside the nucleus. In this paper, we study the anisotropic flow
coefficients such as elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), which
are sensitive to the nuclear geometry of colliding nuclei, for p-O and O-O
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=9.61$ TeV and 7 TeV respectively. The study is
performed employing a hybrid model encompassing IPGlasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD.
The results of the clustered nuclear geometry are compared with those of the

<p class='card-text'>Detecting vehicles in satellite images is crucial for traffic management,
urban planning, and disaster response. However, current models struggle with
real-world diversity, particularly across different regions. This challenge is
amplified by geographic bias in existing datasets, which often focus on
specific areas and overlook regions like the Middle East. To address this gap,
we present the Vehicles in the Middle East (VME) dataset, designed explicitly
for vehicle detection in high-resolution satellite images from Middle Eastern
countries. Sourced from Maxar, the VME dataset spans 54 cities across 12
countries, comprising over 4,000 image tiles and more than 100,000 vehicles,
annotated using both manual and semi-automated methods. Additionally, we
introduce the largest benchmark dataset for Car Detection in Satellite Imagery
(CDSI), combining images from multiple sources to enhance global car detection.
Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on existing datasets perform
poorly on Middle Eastern images, while the VME dataset significantly improves
detection accuracy in this region. Moreover, state-of-the-art models trained on
CDSI achieve substantial improvements in global car detection.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Autoregressive language models (LMs) generate one token at a time, yet human
reasoning operates over higher-level abstractions - sentences, propositions,
and concepts. This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn
to reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In
this work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such
abstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We
present a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in
sentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next
sentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical
representation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to
preserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via
next-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both
under two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted
embedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely
in embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics,
logic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous
inference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while
reducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half. We also present early signs
of scalability and modular adaptation. Finally, to visualize latent
trajectories, we introduce SentenceLens, a diagnostic tool that decodes
intermediate model states into interpretable sentences. Together, our results
indicate that pretrained LMs can effectively transition to abstract, structured
reasoning within latent embedding spaces.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The computation of the three-particle correlation function involving three
hadrons started just recently after the first publications of ALICE
measurements. Key elements to be considered are the correct description of the
asymptotics, antisymmetrization issues and, in most cases, the treatment of the
Coulomb interaction. In the case of the $ppp$ correlation function, a first
analysis was done where the hyperspherical adiabatic method was used to
determine the $ppp$ wave function at different energies. Although the
asymptotic behavior, antisymmetrization issues and the treatment of the Coulomb
interaction were discussed in detail, the convergence properties of the
adiabatic basis were studied at low energies around the formation of the
correlation peak determined mainly by the $J^\pi=1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ three-body
states. Since many and very precise data have been taken or are planned to be
measured at energies beyond the peak, we present an analysis of the convergence
characteristics of the basis as the energy of the process increases. We show
that in order to describe correctly the correlation tail it is necessary to
consider three-body states up to $J^\pi=21/2^-$ whereas higher states can be
considered as free. Once those states are incorporated solving the associate
dynamical equations, the agreement with the experimental data is found to be

<p class='card-text'>Decision Transformer (DT) has recently demonstrated strong generalizability
in dynamic resource allocation within unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks,
compared to conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, its
performance is hindered due to zero-padding for varying state dimensions,
inability to manage long-term energy constraint, and challenges in acquiring
expert samples for few-shot fine-tuning in new scenarios. To overcome these
limitations, we propose an attention-enhanced prompt Decision Transformer
(APDT) framework to optimize trajectory planning and user scheduling, aiming to
minimize the average age of information (AoI) under long-term energy constraint
in UAV-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Specifically, we enhance the
convenional DT framework by incorporating an attention mechanism to accommodate
varying numbers of terrestrial users, introducing a prompt mechanism based on
short trajectory demonstrations for rapid adaptation to new scenarios, and
designing a token-assisted method to address the UAV's long-term energy
constraint. The APDT framework is first pre-trained on offline datasets and
then efficiently generalized to new scenarios. Simulations demonstrate that
APDT achieves twice faster in terms of convergence rate and reduces average AoI

<p class='card-text'>Decision making is a central problem in AI that can be formalized using a
Markov Decision Process. A problem is that, with increasing numbers of
(indistinguishable) objects, the state space grows exponentially. To compute
policies, the state space has to be enumerated. Even more possibilities have to
be enumerated if the size of the action space depends on the size of the state
space, especially if we allow concurrent actions. To tackle the exponential
blow-up in the action and state space, we present a first-order representation
to store the spaces in polynomial instead of exponential size in the number of
objects and introduce Foreplan, a relational forward planner, which uses this
representation to efficiently compute policies for numerous indistinguishable
objects and actions. Additionally, we introduce an even faster approximate
version of Foreplan. Moreover, Foreplan identifies how many objects an agent
should act on to achieve a certain task given restrictions. Further, we provide

<p class='card-text'>We investigate multi-period mean-risk portfolio optimization for long-horizon
Defined Contribution plans, focusing on buffered Probability of Exceedance
(bPoE), a more intuitive, dollar-based alternative to Conditional Value-at-Risk
(CVaR). We formulate both pre-commitment and time-consistent Mean-bPoE and
Mean-CVaR portfolio optimization problems under realistic investment
constraints (e.g., no leverage, no short selling) and jump-diffusion dynamics.
These formulations are naturally framed as bilevel optimization problems, with
an outer search over the shortfall threshold and an inner optimization over
rebalancing decisions. We establish an equivalence between the pre-commitment
formulations through a one-to-one correspondence of their scalarization optimal
sets, while showing that no such equivalence holds in the time-consistent
setting. We develop provably convergent numerical schemes for the value
functions associated with both pre-commitment and time-consistent formulations
of these mean-risk control problems.
  Using nearly a century of market data, we find that time-consistent Mean-bPoE
strategies closely resemble their pre-commitment counterparts. In particular,
they maintain alignment with investors' preferences for a minimum acceptable
terminal wealth level-unlike time-consistent Mean-CVaR, which often leads to
counterintuitive control behavior. We further show that bPoE, as a strictly
tail-oriented measure, prioritizes guarding against catastrophic shortfalls
while allowing meaningful upside exposure, making it especially appealing for
long-horizon wealth security. These findings highlight bPoE's practical

<p class='card-text'>Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has shown promise in
mitigating hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge during generation. Existing MRAG methods
typically adopt a static retrieval pipeline that fetches relevant information
from multiple Knowledge Bases (KBs), followed by a refinement step. However,
these approaches overlook the reasoning and planning capabilities of MLLMs to
dynamically determine how to interact with different KBs during the reasoning
process. To address this limitation, we propose R1-Router, a novel MRAG
framework that learns to decide when and where to retrieve knowledge based on
the evolving reasoning state. Specifically, R1-Router can generate follow-up
queries according to the current reasoning step, routing these intermediate
queries to the most suitable KB, and integrating external knowledge into a
coherent reasoning trajectory to answer the original query. Furthermore, we
introduce Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), a tailored
reinforcement learning algorithm that assigns step-specific rewards to optimize
the reasoning behavior of MLLMs. Experimental results on various open-domain QA
benchmarks across multiple modalities demonstrate that R1-Router outperforms

<p class='card-text'>Optimal Transport (OT) has attracted significant interest in the machine
learning community, not only for its ability to define meaningful distances
between probability distributions -- such as the Wasserstein distance -- but
also for its formulation of OT plans. Its computational complexity remains a
bottleneck, though, and slicing techniques have been developed to scale OT to
large datasets. Recently, a novel slicing scheme, dubbed min-SWGG, lifts a
single one-dimensional plan back to the original multidimensional space,
finally selecting the slice that yields the lowest Wasserstein distance as an
approximation of the full OT plan. Despite its computational and theoretical
advantages, min-SWGG inherits typical limitations of slicing methods: (i) the
number of required slices grows exponentially with the data dimension, and (ii)
it is constrained to linear projections. Here, we reformulate min-SWGG as a
bilevel optimization problem and propose a differentiable approximation scheme
to efficiently identify the optimal slice, even in high-dimensional settings.

<p class='card-text'>Foundational world models must be both interactive and preserve
spatiotemporal coherence for effective future planning with action choices.
However, present models for long video generation have limited inherent world
modeling capabilities due to two main challenges: compounding errors and
insufficient memory mechanisms. We enhance image-to-video models with
interactive capabilities through additional action conditioning and
autoregressive framework, and reveal that compounding error is inherently
irreducible in autoregressive video generation, while insufficient memory
mechanism leads to incoherence of world models. We propose video retrieval
augmented generation (VRAG) with explicit global state conditioning, which
significantly reduces long-term compounding errors and increases spatiotemporal
consistency of world models. In contrast, naive autoregressive generation with
extended context windows and retrieval-augmented generation prove less
effective for video generation, primarily due to the limited in-context
learning capabilities of current video models. Our work illuminates the
fundamental challenges in video world models and establishes a comprehensive
benchmark for improving video generation models with internal world modeling
capabilities.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar environments is crucial for household
service robots but remains challenging due to the need for both low-level path
planning and high-level scene understanding. While recent vision-language model
(VLM) based zero-shot approaches reduce dependence on prior maps and
scene-specific training data, they face significant limitations: spatiotemporal
discontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations,
and insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures. We propose
DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory
Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of
Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The
Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology
Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines
RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develops
Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency. We evaluate DORAEMON
on the HM3D, MP3D, and GOAT datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL)
metrics, significantly outperforming existing methods. We also introduce a new
evaluation metric (AORI) to assess navigation intelligence better.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DORAEMON's effectiveness in zero-shot
autonomous navigation without requiring prior map building or pre-training.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Sampling-based motion planners such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree* (RRT*)
and its informed variant IRRT* are widely used for optimal path planning in
complex environments. However, these methods often suffer from slow convergence
and high variance due to their reliance on random sampling, particularly when
initial solution discovery is delayed. This paper presents Enhanced SIRRT*
(E-SIRRT*), a structure-aware planner that improves upon the original SIRRT*
framework by introducing two key enhancements: hybrid path smoothing and
bidirectional rewiring. Hybrid path smoothing refines the initial path through
spline fitting and collision-aware correction, while bidirectional rewiring
locally optimizes tree connectivity around the smoothed path to improve cost
propagation. Experimental results demonstrate that E-SIRRT* consistently
outperforms IRRT* and SIRRT* in terms of initial path quality, convergence
rate, and robustness across 100 trials. Unlike IRRT*, which exhibits high
variability due to stochastic initialization, E-SIRRT* achieves repeatable and
efficient performance through deterministic skeleton-based initialization and
structural refinement.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Embodied robots nowadays can already handle many real-world manipulation
tasks. However, certain other real-world tasks (e.g., shooting a basketball
into a hoop) are highly agile and require high execution precision, presenting
additional challenges for methods primarily designed for quasi-static
manipulation tasks. This leads to increased efforts in costly data collection,
laborious reward design, or complex motion planning. Such tasks, however, are
far less challenging for humans. Say a novice basketball player typically needs
only $\sim$10 attempts to make their first successful shot, by roughly
imitating a motion prior and then iteratively adjusting their motion based on
the past outcomes. Inspired by this human learning paradigm, we propose the
Adaptive Diffusion Action Plannin (ADAP) algorithm, a simple & scalable
approach which iteratively refines its action plan by few real-world trials
within a learned prior motion pattern, until reaching a specific goal.
Experiments demonstrated that ADAP can learn and accomplish a wide range of
goal-conditioned agile dynamic tasks with human-level precision and efficiency
directly in real-world, such as throwing a basketball into the hoop in fewer
than 10 trials. Project website:https://adap-robotics.github.io/ .</p>

<p class='card-text'>The growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to significantly
increase demand on electric power distribution systems, many of which are
already nearing capacity. To address this, the paper presents a comprehensive
framework for analyzing the impact of large-scale EV integration on
distribution networks. Using the open-source simulator OpenDSS, the framework
builds detailed, scalable models of electric distribution systems,
incorporating high-fidelity synthetic data from the SMART-DS project. The study
models three feeders from an urban substation in San Francisco down to the
household level. A key contribution is the framework's ability to identify
critical system components likely to require upgrades due to increased EV
loads. It also incorporates advanced geospatial visualization through QGIS,
which aids in understanding how charging demands affect specific grid areas,
helping stakeholders target infrastructure reinforcements. To ensure realistic
load modeling, the framework uses EV load profiles based on U.S. Department of
Energy projections, factoring in vehicle types, charging behaviors, usage
patterns, and adoption rates. By leveraging large-scale synthetic data, the
model remains relevant for real-world utility planning. It supports diverse
simulation scenarios, from light to heavy EV charging loads and distributed vs.
centralized charging patterns, offering a practical planning tool for utilities
and policymakers. Additionally, its modular design enables easy adaptation to
different geographic regions, feeder setups, and adoption scenarios, making it
suitable for future studies on evolving grid conditions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Fine-grained robot manipulation, such as lifting and rotating a bottle to
display the label on the cap, requires robust reasoning about object parts and
their relationships with intended tasks. Despite recent advances in training
general-purpose robot manipulation policies guided by language instructions,
there is a notable lack of large-scale datasets for fine-grained manipulation
tasks with part-level instructions and diverse 3D object instances annotated
with part-level labels. In this work, we introduce PartInstruct, the first
large-scale benchmark for training and evaluating fine-grained robot
manipulation models using part-level instructions. PartInstruct comprises 513
object instances across 14 categories, each annotated with part-level
information, and 1302 fine-grained manipulation tasks organized into 16 task
classes. Our training set consists of over 10,000 expert demonstrations
synthesized in a 3D simulator, where each demonstration is paired with a
high-level task instruction, a chain of base part-based skill instructions, and
ground-truth 3D information about the object and its parts. Additionally, we
designed a comprehensive test suite to evaluate the generalizability of learned
policies across new states, objects, and tasks. We evaluated several
state-of-the-art robot manipulation approaches, including end-to-end
vision-language policy learning and bi-level planning models for robot
manipulation on our benchmark. The experimental results reveal that current
models struggle to robustly ground part concepts and predict actions in 3D
space, and face challenges when manipulating object parts in long-horizon
tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Geminga is the third gamma-ray pulsar firmly detected by imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) after the Crab and the Vela pulsars. Most of its
emission is expected at tens of GeV, and, out of the planned telescopes of the
upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), the Large-Sized
Telescopes (LSTs) are the only ones with optimised sensitivity at these
energies. We aim to characterise the gamma-ray pulse shape and spectrum of
Geminga as observed by the first LST (hereafter LST-1) of the CTAO-North.
Furthermore, this study confirms the great performance and the improved energy
threshold of the telescope, as low as 10 GeV for pulsar analysis, with respect
to current-generation Cherenkov telescopes. We analysed 60 hours of
good-quality data taken by the LST-1 at zenith angles below 50$^\circ$.
Additionally, a new Fermi-LAT analysis of 16.6 years of data was carried out to
extend the spectral analysis down to 100 MeV. Lastly, a detailed study of the
systematic effects was performed. We report the detection of Geminga in the
energy range between 20 and 65 GeV. Of the two peaks of the phaseogram, the
second one, P2, is detected with a significance of 12.2$\sigma$, while the
first (P1) reaches a significance level of 2.6$\sigma$. The best-fit model for
the spectrum of P2 was found to be a power law with $\Gamma = (4.5 \pm
0.4_{stat})^{+0.2_{sys}}_{-0.6_{sys}}$, compatible with the previous results
obtained by the MAGIC. No evidence of curvature is found in the LST-1 energy
range. The joint fit with Fermi data confirms a preference for a
sub-exponential cut-off over a pure exponential, even though both models fail
to reproduce the data above several tens of GeV. The overall results presented
in this paper prove that the LST-1 is an excellent telescope for the
observation of pulsars, and improved sensitivity is expected to be achieved
with the full CTAO-North.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Active vision, also known as active perception, refers to the process of
actively selecting where and how to look in order to gather task-relevant
information. It is a critical component of efficient perception and
decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and
decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention.
However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence,
there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn
active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic
definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the
recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a
special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search
efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose
ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on
top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We
further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across
both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding,
and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote
sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive
segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot
reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit
reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and
evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in
MLLMs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Many motion planning algorithms for automated driving require estimating the
probability of collision (POC) to account for uncertainties in the measurement
and estimation of the motion of road users. Common POC estimation techniques
often utilize sampling-based methods that suffer from computational
inefficiency and a non-deterministic estimation, i.e., each estimation result
for the same inputs is slightly different. In contrast, optimization-based
motion planning algorithms require computationally efficient POC estimation,
ideally using deterministic estimation, such that typical optimization
algorithms for motion planning retain feasibility. Estimating the POC
analytically, however, is challenging because it depends on understanding the
collision conditions (e.g., vehicle's shape) and characterizing the uncertainty
in motion prediction. In this paper, we propose an approach in which we
estimate the POC between two vehicles by over-approximating their shapes by a
multi-circular shape approximation. The position and heading of the predicted
vehicle are modelled as random variables, contrasting with the literature,
where the heading angle is often neglected. We guarantee that the provided POC
is an over-approximation, which is essential in providing safety guarantees,
and present a computationally efficient algorithm for computing the POC
estimate for Gaussian uncertainty in the position and heading. This algorithm
is then used in a path-following stochastic model predictive controller (SMPC)
for motion planning. With the proposed algorithm, the SMPC generates
reproducible trajectories while the controller retains its feasibility in the
presented test cases and demonstrates the ability to handle varying levels of
uncertainty.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The Generalized Independent Set (GIS) problem extends the classical maximum
independent set problem by incorporating profits for vertices and penalties for
edges. This generalized problem has been identified in diverse applications in
fields such as forest harvest planning, competitive facility location, social
network analysis, and even machine learning. However, solving the GIS problem
in large-scale, real-world networks remains computationally challenging. In
this paper, we explore data reduction techniques to address this challenge. We
first propose 14 reduction rules that can reduce the input graph with rigorous
optimality guarantees. We then present a reduction-driven local search (RLS)
algorithm that integrates these reduction rules into the pre-processing, the
initial solution generation, and the local search components in a
computationally efficient way. The RLS is empirically evaluated on 278 graphs
arising from different application scenarios. The results indicates that the
RLS is highly competitive -- For most graphs, it achieves significantly
superior solutions compared to other known solvers, and it effectively provides
solutions for graphs exceeding 260 million edges, a task at which every other
known method fails. Analysis also reveals that the data reduction plays a key

<p class='card-text'>A cardiac digital twin is a virtual replica of a patient's heart for
screening, diagnosis, prognosis, risk assessment, and treatment planning of
cardiovascular diseases. This requires an anatomically accurate
patient-specific 3D structural representation of the heart, suitable for
electro-mechanical simulations or study of disease mechanisms. However,
generation of cardiac digital twins at scale is demanding and there are no
public repositories of models across demographic groups. We describe an
automatic open-source pipeline for creating patient-specific left and right
ventricular meshes from cardiovascular magnetic resonance images, its
application to a large cohort of ~55000 participants from UK Biobank, and the
construction of the most comprehensive cohort of adult heart models to date,
comprising 1423 representative meshes across sex (male, female), body mass
index (range: 16 - 42 kg/m$^2$) and age (range: 49 - 80 years). Our code is
available at https://github.com/cdttk/biv-volumetric-meshing/tree/plos2025 ,
and pre-trained networks, representative volumetric meshes with fibers and UVCs
will be made available soon.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) collect and pseudo-label terabytes of multi-modal
data localized to HD maps during normal fleet testing. However, identifying
interesting and safety-critical scenarios from uncurated driving logs remains a
significant challenge. Traditional scenario mining techniques are error-prone
and prohibitively time-consuming, often relying on hand-crafted structured
queries. In this work, we revisit spatio-temporal scenario mining through the
lens of recent vision-language models (VLMs) to detect whether a described
scenario occurs in a driving log and, if so, precisely localize it in both time
and space. To address this problem, we introduce RefAV, a large-scale dataset
of 10,000 diverse natural language queries that describe complex multi-agent
interactions relevant to motion planning derived from 1000 driving logs in the
Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset. We evaluate several referential multi-object
trackers and present an empirical analysis of our baselines. Notably, we find
that naively repurposing off-the-shelf VLMs yields poor performance, suggesting
that scenario mining presents unique challenges. Our code and dataset are
available at https://github.com/CainanD/RefAV/ and
