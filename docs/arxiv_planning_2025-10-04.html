  Risk at Record 2.9-Million Observation Scale</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Arctic warming threatens over 100 billion in permafrost-dependent
infrastructure across Northern territories, yet existing risk assessment
frameworks lack spatiotemporal validation, uncertainty quantification, and
operational decision-support capabilities. We present a hybrid physics-machine
learning framework integrating 2.9 million observations from 171,605 locations
(2005-2021) combining permafrost fraction data with climate reanalysis. Our
stacked ensemble model (Random Forest + Histogram Gradient Boosting + Elastic
Net) achieves R2=0.980 (RMSE=5.01 pp) with rigorous spatiotemporal
cross-validation preventing data leakage. To address machine learning
limitations in extrapolative climate scenarios, we develop a hybrid approach
combining learned climate-permafrost relationships (60%) with physical
permafrost sensitivity models (40%, -10 pp/C). Under RCP8.5 forcing (+5C over
10 years), we project mean permafrost fraction decline of -20.3 pp (median:
-20.0 pp), with 51.5% of Arctic Russia experiencing over 20 percentage point
loss. Infrastructure risk classification identifies 15% high-risk zones (25%
medium-risk) with spatially explicit uncertainty maps. Our framework represents
the largest validated permafrost ML dataset globally, provides the first
operational hybrid physics-ML forecasting system for Arctic infrastructure, and
delivers open-source tools enabling probabilistic permafrost projections for
engineering design codes and climate adaptation planning. The methodology is
generalizable to other permafrost regions and demonstrates how hybrid
approaches can overcome pure data-driven limitations in climate change
applications.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Arman Behnam</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-02 14:52:08</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and
anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior
and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series
forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support
real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak
distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error
accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their
inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of
non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-02 13:30:44</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Within the modeling framework of Markov games, we propose a series of
algorithms for coordinated car-following using distributed model predictive
control (DMPC). Instead of tracking prescribed feasible trajectories, driving
policies are solved directly as outcomes of the DMPC optimization given the
driver's perceivable states. The coordinated solutions are derived using the
best response dynamics via iterated self-play, and are facilitated by direct
negotiation using inter-agent or agent-infrastructure communication. These
solutions closely approximate either Nash equilibrium or centralized
optimization. By re-parameterizing the action sequence in DMPC as a curve along
the planning horizon, we are able to systematically reduce the original DMPC to
very efficient grid searches such that the optimal solution to the original
DMPC can be well executed in real-time. Within our modeling framework, it is
natural to cast traffic control problems as mechanism design problems, in which
all agents are endogenized on an equal footing with full incentive
compatibility. We show how traffic efficiency can be dramatically improved
while keeping stop-and-go phantom waves tamed at high vehicle densities. Our
approach can be viewed as an alternative way to formulate coordinated adaptive
cruise control (CACC) without an explicit platooning (or with all vehicles in
the traffic system treated as a single extended platoon). We also address the
issue of linear stability of the associated discrete-time traffic dynamics and
demonstrate why it does not always tell the full story about the traffic
stability.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-02 12:32:01</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The communication of technical insight in scientific manuscripts often relies
on ad-hoc formatting choices, resulting in inconsistent visual emphasis and
limited portability across document classes. This paper introduces ktbox, a
modular LaTeX framework that unifies semantic color palettes, structured
highlight boxes, taxonomy trees, and author metadata utilities into a coherent
system for scholarly writing. The framework is distributed as a set of
lightweight, namespaced components: ktcolor.sty for semantic palettes,
ktbox.sty for structured highlight and takeaway environments, ktlrtree.sty for
taxonomy trees with fusion and auxiliary annotations, and ktorcid.sty for
ORCID-linked author metadata. Each component is independently usable yet
interoperable, ensuring compatibility with major templates such as IEEEtran,
acmart, iclr conference, and beamer. Key features include auto-numbered
takeaway boxes, wide-format highlights, flexible taxonomy tree visualizations,
and multi-column layouts supporting embedded tables, enumerations, and code
blocks. By adopting a clear separation of concerns and enforcing a consistent
naming convention under the kt namespace, the framework transforms visual
styling from cosmetic add-ons into reproducible, extensible building blocks of
scientific communication, improving clarity, portability, and authoring
efficiency across articles, posters, and presentations.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper examines replication portfolio construction in incomplete markets
- a key problem in financial engineering with applications in pricing, hedging,
balance sheet management, and energy storage planning. We model this as a
two-player game between an investor and the market, where the investor makes
strategic bets on future states while the market reveals outcomes. Inspired by
the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search in stochastic games, we introduce an
AlphaZero-based system and compare its performance to deep hedging - a widely
used industry method based on gradient descent. Through theoretical analysis
and experiments, we show that deep hedging struggles in environments where the
$Q$-function is not subject to convexity constraints - such as those involving
non-convex transaction costs, capital constraints, or regulatory limitations -
converging to local optima. We construct specific market environments to
highlight these limitations and demonstrate that AlphaZero consistently finds
near-optimal replication strategies. On the theoretical side, we establish a
connection between deep hedging and convex optimization, suggesting that its
effectiveness is contingent on convexity assumptions. Our experiments further
suggest that AlphaZero is more sample-efficient - an important advantage in

<p class='card-text'>Phylogenetic Diversity(PD)is a well-regarded measure of the overall
biodiversity of a set of present-day species(taxa)that indicates its ecological
significance.In the Maximize Phylogenetic Diversity(Max-PD)problem one is asked
to find a small set of taxa in a phylogenetic tree for which this measure is
maximized.Max-PD is particularly relevant in conservation planning,where
limited resources necessitate prioritizing certain taxa to minimize
biodiversity loss.Although Max-PD can be solved in polynomial time
[Steel,SB,2005;Pardi&Goldman,PLoS,2005],its generalizations-which aim to model
biological processes and other aspects in conservation planning with greater
accuracy-often exhibit NP-hardness,making them computationally challenging.This
thesis explores a selection of these generalized problems within the framework
of parameterized complexity. In Generalized Noah's Ark Problem(GNAP),each taxon
only survives at a certain survival probability,which can be increased by
investing more money in the taxon.We show that GNAP is W[1]-hard with respect
to the number of taxa but is XP with respect to the number of different costs
and different survival probabilities. Additionally,we show that unit-cost-NAP,a
special case of GNAP,is NP-hard. In Time Sensitive Maximization of Phylogenetic

<p class='card-text'>Humanoid robot soccer presents several challenges, particularly in
maintaining system stability during aggressive kicking motions while achieving
precise ball trajectory control. Current solutions, whether traditional
position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches,
exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent
approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated
advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing
progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This
severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering
tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal
trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to
bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot
trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and
acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental
results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking
behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments
confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms,
and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the
soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) is a critical component toward deploying
mobile robots in everyday, uncontrolled environments such as homes, schools,
and workplaces. In this context, a robot must locate target objects in
previously unseen environments using only its onboard perception. Success
requires the integration of semantic understanding, spatial reasoning, and
long-horizon planning, which is a combination that remains extremely
challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant
paradigm, progress has spanned a wide range of design choices, yet the field
still lacks a unifying analysis to determine which components truly drive
performance. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of modular
RL-based ObjectNav systems, decomposing them into three key components:
perception, policy, and test-time enhancement. Through extensive controlled
experiments, we isolate the contribution of each and uncover clear trends:
perception quality and test-time strategies are decisive drivers of
performance, whereas policy improvements with current methods yield only
marginal gains. Building on these insights, we propose practical design
guidelines and demonstrate an enhanced modular system that surpasses
State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods by 6.6% on SPL and by a 2.7% success rate. We
also introduce a human baseline under identical conditions, where experts
achieve an average 98% success, underscoring the gap between RL agents and

<p class='card-text'>Understanding how individuals perceive their living environment is a complex
task, as it reflects both personal and contextual determinants. In this paper,
we address this task by analyzing the environmental module of the Italian
nationwide health surveillance system PASSI (Progressi delle Aziende Sanitarie
per la Salute in Italia), integrating it with contextual information at the
municipal level, including socio-economic indicators, pollution exposure, and
other geographical characteristics. Methodologically, we adopt a penalized
semi-parallel cumulative ordinal regression model to analyze how subjective
perceptions are shaped by both personal and territorial determinants. The
approach balances flexibility and interpretability by allowing both parallel
and non-parallel effects while regularizing estimates to address
multicollinearity and separation issues. We use the model as an analytical tool
to uncover the determinants of positivity and neutrality in environmental
perceptions, defined as factors that contribute the most to improving
perception or increasing the sense of neutrality. The results are diverse.
First, results reveal significant heterogeneity across Italian territories,
indicating that local characteristics strongly shape environmental perception.
Second, various individual factors interact with contextual influences to shape
perceptions. Third, hazardous environmental factors, such as higher PM2.5
levels, appear to be associated with poorer environmental perception,
suggesting a tendency among respondents to recognize specific environmental
issues. Overall, the approach demonstrates strong potential for application and

<p class='card-text'>Spatial data are central to applications such as environmental monitoring and
urban planning, but are often distributed across devices where privacy and
communication constraints limit direct sharing. Federated modeling offers a
practical solution that preserves data privacy while enabling global modeling
across distributed data sources. For instance, environmental sensor networks
are privacy- and bandwidth-constrained, motivating federated spatial modeling
that shares only privacy-preserving summaries to produce timely,
high-resolution pollution maps without centralizing raw data. However, existing
federated modeling approaches either ignore spatial dependence or rely on
synchronous updates that suffer from stragglers in heterogeneous environments.
This work proposes an asynchronous federated modeling framework for spatial
data based on low-rank Gaussian process approximations. The method employs
block-wise optimization and introduces strategies for gradient correction,
adaptive aggregation, and stabilized updates. We establish linear convergence
with explicit dependence on staleness, a result of standalone theoretical
significance. Moreover, numerical experiments demonstrate that the asynchronous
algorithm achieves synchronous performance under balanced resource allocation

multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,
enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-02 06:25:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to
its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking
a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths.
These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and
restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose
Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers
soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport
plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target
layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This
yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a
soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass
distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and
human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses
standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth,
fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers,
deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by
distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns
emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent
in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable
comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in
architecture or depth.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-step manipulation in dynamic environments remains challenging. Two
major families of methods fail in distinct ways: (i) imitation learning (IL) is
reactive but lacks compositional generalization, as monolithic policies do not
decide which skill to reuse when scenes change; (ii) classical task-and-motion
planning (TAMP) offers compositionality but has prohibitive planning latency,
preventing real-time failure recovery. We introduce SymSkill, a unified
learning framework that combines the benefits of IL and TAMP, allowing
compositional generalization and failure recovery in real-time. Offline,
SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills directly from
unlabeled and unsegmented demonstrations. At execution time, upon specifying a
conjunction of one or more learned predicates, SymSkill uses a symbolic planner
to compose and reorder learned skills to achieve the symbolic goals, while
performing recovery at both the motion and symbolic levels in real time.
Coupled with a compliant controller, SymSkill enables safe and uninterrupted
execution under human and environmental disturbances. In RoboCasa simulation,
SymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate. Without
additional data, it composes these skills into multi-step plans requiring up to
6 skill recompositions, recovering robustly from execution failures. On a real
Franka robot, we demonstrate SymSkill, learning from 5 minutes of unsegmented
and unlabeled play data, is capable of performing multiple tasks simply by goal
specifications. The source code and additional analysis can be found on

<p class='card-text'>Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic
control into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve
strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale
crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures
during execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from
unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing
robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real
world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable
to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure
detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to
utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a
novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces
diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be
seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable
creation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune
LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results
show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from
potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA
models pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several
tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different
spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robotic embodiments. We plan to
release the FailSafe code to the community.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this
work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website:

<p class='card-text'>Robot navigation in large, complex, and unknown indoor environments is a
challenging problem. The existing approaches, such as traditional
sampling-based methods, struggle with resolution control and scalability, while
imitation learning-based methods require a large amount of demonstration data.
Active Neural Time Fields (ANTFields) have recently emerged as a promising
solution by using local observations to learn cost-to-go functions without
relying on demonstrations. Despite their potential, these methods are hampered
by challenges such as spectral bias and catastrophic forgetting, which diminish
their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these issues, our approach
decomposes the planning problem into a hierarchical structure. At the high
level, a sparse graph captures the environment's global connectivity, while at
the low level, a planner based on neural fields navigates local obstacles by
solving the Eikonal PDE. This physics-informed strategy overcomes common
pitfalls like spectral bias and neural field fitting difficulties, resulting in
a smooth and precise representation of the cost landscape. We validate our
framework in large-scale environments, demonstrating its enhanced adaptability
and precision compared to previous methods, and highlighting its potential for
online exploration, mapping, and real-world navigation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Robots must adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in
unstructured, open-world environments. Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs)
offer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult
to steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining
objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing
this, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes
internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of
directly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a
visual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware
navigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these
visual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows
natural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale
training, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking
models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level
annotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world
evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on
object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving
success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen
scenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of
distinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities. Videos, code,

<p class='card-text'>Safe motion planning is essential for autonomous vessel operations,
especially in challenging spaces such as narrow inland waterways. However,
conventional motion planning approaches are often computationally intensive or
overly conservative. This paper proposes a safe motion planning strategy
combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).
We introduce a time-varying inflated ellipse obstacle representation, where the
inflation radius is adjusted depending on the relative position and attitude
between the vessel and the obstacle. The proposed adaptive inflation reduces
the conservativeness of the controller compared to traditional fixed-ellipsoid
obstacle formulations. The MPC solution provides an approximate motion plan,
and high-order CBFs ensure the vessel's safety using the varying inflation
radius. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed
strategy enables the fully-actuated autonomous robot vessel to navigate through
narrow spaces in real time and resolve potential deadlocks, all while ensuring
safety.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reliable long-range flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GNSS-denied

are unavailable in previously unseen areas and embedded platforms provide
limited computational power. We present a fully onboard UAV system developed
for the SPRIN-D Funke Fully Autonomous Flight Challenge, which required 9 km
long-range waypoint navigation below 25 m AGL (Above Ground Level) without GNSS

LiDAR-derived local heightmaps to a prior geo-data heightmap via
gradient-template matching and fuses the evidence with odometry in a clustered
particle filter. Deployed during the competition, the system executed
kilometer-scale flights across urban, forest, and open-field terrain and

<p class='card-text'>This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric

throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair

attached at the SOX location on the Columbus module on the ISS. TIGERISS will
make the first definitive measurements of Ultra-Heavy Galactic Cosmic Rays
(UHGCRs; Z >29) on an individual element basis past barium ($^{56}$Ba), through
the lanthinides, and to lead ($^{82}$Pb). TIGERISS has a geometry factor of
1.06 m$^2$ sr and is comprised of four planes of single-sided silicon strip
detectors (SSDs) arranged in orthogonal X-Y layers with an X-Y pair above and
an X-Y pair below two large-area Cherenkov detectors. The top Cherenkov
detector is comprised of a mosaic of aerogel radiators (n =1.05) while the
bottom Cherenkov detector has an acrylic radiator (n = 1.49). The combination
of the Cherenkov velocity measurements with the precise measurements of the
ionization and trajectory of the traversing cosmic rays leads to highly
accurate charge measurements of $<$ 0.25 c.u. over the entire elemental range
of $^5$B through $^{82}$Pb. These TIGERISS measurements are highly sensitive in
determining the strength of s-process, r-process, and rp-processes of Galactic
nucleosynthesis while providing critical data needed for multi-messenger

<p class='card-text'>Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban
planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well
as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing
fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these
deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as
handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly
when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how
a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from
a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines
CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The
research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel
survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the
stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the
hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match
single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships
between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved
performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a
descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with
target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an
effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative
models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to
