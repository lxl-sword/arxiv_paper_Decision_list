<p class='card-text'>Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to
reach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that
promises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding
value-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to
address these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective
Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an
asymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy
forcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent
space, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal
sub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian
out-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within
reachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and
goal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and
robustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.</p>

  Primitives</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Yizhou Chen, Hang Xu, Dongjie Yu, Zeqing Zhang, Yi Ren, Jia Pan</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-23 16:38:29</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Imitation learning (IL), particularly when leveraging high-dimensional visual
inputs for policy training, has proven intuitive and effective in complex
bimanual manipulation tasks. Nonetheless, the generalization capability of
visuomotor policies remains limited, especially when small demonstration
datasets are available. Accumulated errors in visuomotor policies significantly
hinder their ability to complete long-horizon tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SViP, a framework that seamlessly integrates visuomotor
policies into task and motion planning (TAMP). SViP partitions human
demonstrations into bimanual and unimanual operations using a semantic scene
graph monitor. Continuous decision variables from the key scene graph are
employed to train a switching condition generator. This generator produces
parameterized scripted primitives that ensure reliable performance even when
encountering out-of-the-distribution observations. Using only 20 real-world
demonstrations, we show that SViP enables visuomotor policies to generalize
across out-of-distribution initial conditions without requiring object pose
estimators. For previously unseen tasks, SViP automatically discovers effective
solutions to achieve the goal, leveraging constraint modeling in TAMP
formulism. In real-world experiments, SViP outperforms state-of-the-art
generative IL methods, indicating wider applicability for more complex tasks.

<p class='card-text'>We study the Universal Solvability of Robot Motion Planning on Graphs (USolR)
problem: given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and p robots, determine whether
any arbitrary configuration of the robots can be transformed into any other
arbitrary configuration via a sequence of valid, collision-free moves. We
design a canonical accumulation procedure that maps arbitrary configurations to
configurations that occupy a fixed subset of vertices, enabling us to analyze
configuration reachability in terms of equivalence classes. We prove that in
instances that are not universally solvable, at least half of all
configurations are unreachable from a given one, and leverage this to design an
efficient randomized algorithm with one-sided error, which can be derandomized
with a blow-up in the running time by a factor of p. Further, we optimize our
deterministic algorithm by using the structure of the input graph G = (V, E),
achieving a running time of O(p * (|V| + |E|)) in sparse graphs and O(|V| +
|E|) in dense graphs. Finally, we consider the Graph Edge Augmentation for
Universal Solvability (EAUS) problem, where given a connected graph G that is
not universally solvable for p robots, the question is to check if for a given
budget b, at most b edges can be added to G to make it universally solvable for
p robots. We provide an upper bound of p - 2 on b for general graphs. On the
other hand, we also provide examples of graphs that require Theta(p) edges to
be added. We further study the Graph Vertex and Edge Augmentation for Universal
Solvability (VEAUS) problem, where a vertices and b edges can be added, and we
provide lower bounds on a and b.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-23 14:34:49</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper presents a novel high-level task planning and optimal coordination
framework for autonomous masonry construction, using a team of heterogeneous
aerial robotic workers, consisting of agents with separate skills for brick
placement and mortar application. This introduces new challenges in scheduling
and coordination, particularly due to the mortar curing deadline required for
structural bonding and ensuring the safety constraints among UAVs operating in
parallel. To address this, an automated pipeline generates the wall
construction plan based on the available bricks while identifying static
structural dependencies and potential conflicts for safe operation. The
proposed framework optimizes UAV task allocation and execution timing by
incorporating dynamically coupled precedence deadline constraints that account
for the curing process and static structural dependency constraints, while
enforcing spatio-temporal constraints to prevent collisions and ensure safety.
The primary objective of the scheduler is to minimize the overall construction
makespan while minimizing logistics, traveling time between tasks, and the
curing time to maintain both adhesion quality and safe workspace separation.
The effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving coordinated and
time-efficient aerial masonry construction is extensively validated through
Gazebo simulated missions. The results demonstrate the framework's capability
to streamline UAV operations, ensuring both structural integrity and safety
during the construction process.</p>

  Target Tracking in Unstructured GPS-Denied Environments</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-23 14:28:30</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Autonomous aerial target tracking in unstructured and GPS-denied environments
remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Many existing methods rely on
motion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to
ensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions.
We introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables
robust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo
camera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute
localization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in
the target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight
object detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based
filtering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These
measurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full
6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive
controller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame.
To ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online
from a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling
real-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate
NOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest
trails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss
and severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each
experiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess
resilience, showing consistent and reliable performance. NOVA achieves agile
target following at speeds exceeding 50 km/h. These results show that
high-speed vision-based tracking is possible in the wild using only onboard
sensing, with no reliance on external localization or environment assumptions.</p>

Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole, consisting of 81 pairs of ice-Cherenkov
tanks. The rise in the energy threshold of air-shower measurements in IceTop

to comprise elevated scintillator panels and radio antennas controlled by
hybrid DAQ systems. The detectors of the SAE are also expected to extend to the
planned IceCube-Gen2 Surface Array. An initial study with a prototype station

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-23 11:28:27</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In cable driven parallel robots (CDPRs), the payload is suspended using a
network of cables whose length can be controlled to maneuver the payload within
the workspace. Compared to rigid link robots, CDPRs provide better
maneuverability due to the flexibility of the cables and consume lesser power
due to the high strength-to-weight ratio of the cables. However, amongst other
things, the flexibility of the cables and the fact that they can only pull (and
not push) render the dynamics of CDPRs complex. Hence advanced modelling
paradigms and control algorithms must be developed to fully utilize the
potential of CDPRs. Furthermore, given the complex dynamics of CDPRs, the
models and control algorithms proposed for them must be validated on
experimental setups to ascertain their efficacy in practice. We have recently
developed an elaborate experimental setup for a CDPR with three cables and
validated elementary open-loop motion planning algorithms on it. In this paper,
we describe several aspects of the design and fabrication of our setup,
including component selection and assembly, and present our experimental
results. Our setup can reproduce complex phenomenon such as the transverse
vibration of the cables seen in large CDPRs and will in the future be used to
model and control such phenomenon and also to validate more sophisticated
motion planning algorithms.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Precise and flexible cart-pushing is a challenging task for mobile robots.
The motion constraints during cart-pushing and the robot's redundancy lead to
complex motion planning problems, while variable payloads and disturbances
present complicated dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel planning and
control framework for flexible whole-body coordination and robust adaptive
control. Our motion planning method employs a local coordinate representation
and a novel kinematic model to solve a nonlinear optimization problem, thereby
enhancing motion maneuverability by generating feasible and flexible push
poses. Furthermore, we present a disturbance rejection control method to resist
disturbances and reduce control errors for the complex control problem without
requiring an accurate dynamic model. We validate our method through extensive
experiments in simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating its
superiority over existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the

<p class='card-text'>This paper studies the problem of using a robot arm to manipulate a uniformly
rotating chain with its bottom end fixed. Existing studies have investigated
ideal rotational shapes for practical applications, yet they do not discuss how
these shapes can be consistently achieved through manipulation planning. Our
work presents a manipulation strategy for stable and consistent shape
transitions. We find that the configuration space of such a chain is
homeomorphic to a three-dimensional cube. Using this property, we suggest a
strategy to manipulate the chain into different configurations, specifically
from one rotation mode to another, while taking stability and feasibility into
consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in physical
experiments by successfully transitioning from rest to the first two rotation
modes. The concepts explored in our work has critical applications in ensuring

<p class='card-text'>Large vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving (AD) are evolving
beyond perception and cognition tasks toward motion planning. However, we
identify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn
shortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly
strong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and
(2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with
the motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex
reasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this
paper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1
designed to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1
first undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing
both long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step
from visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is
trained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the
discovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by
rewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental
evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that
Drive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
VLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging
reasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future
research and applications.</p>

<p class='card-text'>(Abridged) Clusters of galaxies, formed in the latest stages of structure
formation, are unique cosmological probes. With the advent of large CMB surveys
like those from the Planck satellite, the ACT and SPT telescopes, we now have
access to a large number of galaxy clusters detected at millimeter wavelengths
via the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Nevertheless, it is
interesting to complement them with high-angular-resolution (tens of
arcseconds) observations to target the lowest-mass and highest-redshift
clusters. This is the case of observations with the NIKA2 camera, which is
installed on the IRAM 30--m telescope in Pico Veleta, Spain. We used the
existing 150 GHz (2 mm) data from the NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey (N2CLS)
Large Program to blindly search for galaxy clusters in the well-known COSMOS
field, across a 877 arcmin$^2$ region centered on (R.A., Dec.)$_{J2000}$ =
(10h00m28.81s, +02d17m30.44s). We first developed a dedicated data reduction
pipeline to construct NIKA2 maps at 2 mm. We then used a matched-filter
algorithm to extract cluster candidates assuming a universal pressure profile
to model the expected cluster tSZ signal. We computed the purity and
completeness of the sample by applying the previous algorithm to simulated maps
of the sky signal in the COSMOS field. We find a total of 16 cluster candidates
at S/N > 4, from which eight have either an optical or X-ray cluster (or group
of galaxies) counterpart. This is the first blind detection of clusters of
galaxies at mm wavelengths at 18" angular resolution. From this analysis, we
confirm that NIKA2 and the IRAM 30--m telescope should be sensitive to low-mass
clusters at intermediate and high redshift, complementing current and planned
large tSZ-based cluster surveys.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Experimental data collected from a triple-axis spectrometer (TAS) are
typically analysed by considering the instrument resolution, as the resolution
of a TAS instrument is often complex and significantly influences the measured
results. Two Python packages, TasVisAn and InsPy, have been developed to
visualize and analyse data from TAS instruments - particularly from the
cold-neutron TAS Sika and the thermal-neutron TAS Taipan at the Australian
Centre for Neutron Scattering. TasVisAn offers a range of functions, including
data importing, reduction, plotting, contour mapping, convolution fitting, and
more, for data collected on TAS instruments, especially on Sika and Taipan. It
also supports data reduction of the current trendy multi-analyser and
multiplexing TAS instruments, including the multiplexing mode of Sika. Besides,
it includes scan simulation and batch file validation tools for both Taipan and
Sika, assisting users in designing and planning experiments in advance. InsPy
is a general-purpose Python package designed to calculate the four-dimensional
(4D) instrument resolution in momentum-energy space for any TAS instrument.
Combined with InsPy, TasVisAn supports both instrument resolution calculation
and resolution-convoluted data fitting. Its flexible external data import
feature further allows TasVisAn to be adapted for the visualization and
convolution analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data across various TAS

<p class='card-text'>The automation of composite sheet layup is essential to meet the increasing
demand for composite materials in various industries. However, draping plans
for the robotic layup of composite sheets are not robust. A plan that works
well under a certain condition does not work well in a different condition.
Changes in operating conditions due to either changes in material properties or
working environment may lead a draping plan to exhibit suboptimal performance.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework aimed at refining plans
based on the observed execution performance. Our framework prioritizes the
minimization of uncompacted regions while simultaneously improving time
efficiency. To achieve this, we integrate human expertise with data-driven
decision-making to refine expert-crafted plans for diverse production
environments. We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our
approach, revealing significant reductions in the number of corrective paths
required compared to initial expert-crafted plans. Through a combination of
empirical data analysis, action-effectiveness modeling, and search-based
refinement, our system achieves superior time efficiency in robotic layup.
Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in optimizing the
layup process, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in composite

<p class='card-text'>We present the concept of the ultracold neutron (UCN) source with a
superfluid helium-4 converter located in the thermal column of the WWR-K
research reactor at the Institute of Nuclear Physics (INP) in Almaty,
Kazakhstan. The conceptual design is based on the idea of accumulating UCNs in
the source and effectively transporting them to experimental setups. We propose
to improve the UCN density in the source by separating the heat and the UCN
flows from the production volume and decreasing both, the temperature of the
SuperFluid $ ^{ 4 }$He (SF $ ^{ 4 }$He) converter below $\sim$1 K and the
coefficient of UCN wall loss below $\sim$$ 10^{ -4 }$. To achieve the operation
temperatures below 1 K we plan to use a He-3 pumping cryogenic system and
minimize the thermal load on the UCN accumulation trap walls. Additional gain
in the total number of accumulated UCNs can be achieved due to use of a
material of a high critical velocity for the walls of the accumulation trap.
The implementation of such a design critically depends on the availability of
materials with specific UCN and cryogenic properties. This paper describes the
conceptual design of the source, discusses its implementation methods and
material requirements, and plans for material testing studies.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Medical image analysis increasingly relies on the integration of multiple
imaging modalities to capture complementary anatomical and functional
information, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Achieving
aligned feature representations across these diverse modalities is therefore
important for effective multimodal analysis. While contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) and its variant have enabled image-text alignments, they
require explicitly paired data between arbitrary two modalities, which is
difficult to acquire in medical contexts. To address the gap, we present
Multimodal Medical Image Binding with Text (M\textsuperscript{3}Bind), a novel
pre-training framework that enables seamless alignment of multiple medical
imaging modalities through a shared text representation space without requiring
explicit paired data between any two medical image modalities. Specifically,
based on the insight that different images can naturally bind with text,
M\textsuperscript{3}Bind first fine-tunes pre-trained CLIP-like image-text
models to align their modality-specific text embedding space while preserving
their original image-text alignments. Subsequently, we distill these
modality-specific text encoders into a unified model, creating a shared text
embedding space. Experiments on X-ray, CT, retina, ECG, and pathological images
on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that M\textsuperscript{3}Bind achieves
state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, few-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval tasks compared to its CLIP-like counterparts. These
results validate M\textsuperscript{3}Bind's effectiveness in achieving
cross-image-modal alignment for medical analysis.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Air pollution remains a leading global health threat, with fine particulate
matter (PM2.5) contributing to millions of premature deaths annually. Chemical
transport models (CTMs) are essential tools for evaluating how emission
controls improve air quality and save lives, but they are computationally
intensive. Reduced form models accelerate simulations but sacrifice
spatial-temporal granularity, accuracy, and flexibility. Here we present
CleanAir, a deep-learning-based model developed as an efficient alternative to
CTMs in simulating daily PM2.5 and its chemical compositions in response to
precursor emission reductions at 36 km resolution, which could predict PM2.5
concentration for a full year within 10 seconds on a single GPU, a speed five
orders of magnitude faster. Built on a Residual Symmetric 3D U-Net architecture
and trained on more than 2,400 emission reduction scenarios generated by a
well-validated Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, CleanAir
generalizes well across unseen meteorological years and emission patterns. It
produces results comparable to CMAQ in both absolute concentrations and
emission-induced changes, enabling efficient, full-coverage simulations across
short-term interventions and long-term planning horizons. This advance empowers
researchers and policymakers to rapidly evaluate a wide range of air quality
strategies and assess the associated health impacts, thereby supporting more

<p class='card-text'>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks strive to deliver both
high-precision target localization and high-throughput data services across the
entire coverage area. In this work, we examine the fundamental trade-off
between sensing and communication from the perspective of base station (BS)
deployment. Furthermore, we conceive a design that simultaneously maximizes the
target localization coverage, while guaranteeing the desired communication
performance. In contrast to existing schemes optimized for a single target, an
effective network-level approach has to ensure consistent localization accuracy
throughout the entire service area. While employing time-of-flight (ToF) based
localization, we first analyze the deployment problem from a
localization-performance coverage perspective, aiming for minimizing the area
Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (A-CRLB) to ensure uniformly high positioning accuracy
across the service area. We prove that for a fixed number of BSs, uniformly
scaling the service area by a factor \kappa increases the optimal A-CRLB in
proportion to \kappa^{2\beta}, where \beta is the BS-to-target pathloss
exponent. Based on this, we derive an approximate scaling law that links the
achievable A-CRLB across the area of interest to the dimensionality of the
sensing area. We also show that cooperative BSs extends the coverage but yields
marginal A-CRLB improvement as the dimensionality of the sensing area grows.</p>

<p class='card-text'>World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics
conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in
planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts
remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded
assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not
captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise
as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal
reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive
evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce
a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and
character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and
open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied
Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for
adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We
conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient
finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data
compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of
task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong
alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable,

GeNIE integrates a generalizable traversability prediction model built on SAM2

ICRA 2025, where it was evaluated across six countries spanning three

<p class='card-text'>Multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a vital role in monitoring and
data collection in wide area environments with harsh conditions. In most
scenarios, issues such as real-time data retrieval and real-time UAV
positioning are often disregarded, essentially neglecting the communication
constraints. In this paper, we comprehensively address both the coverage of the
target area and the data transmission capabilities of the flying ad hoc network
(FANET). The data throughput of the network is therefore maximized by
optimizing the network topology and the UAV trajectories. The resultant
optimization problem is effectively solved by the proposed reinforcement
learning-based trajectory planning (RL-TP) algorithm and the convex-based
topology optimization (C-TOP) algorithm sequentially. The RL-TP optimizes the
UAV paths while considering the constraints of FANET. The C-TOP maximizes the
data throughput of the network while simultaneously constraining the neighbors
and transmit powers of the UAVs, which is shown to be a convex problem that can
be efficiently solved in polynomial time. Simulations and field experimental
results show that the proposed optimization strategy can effectively plan the
UAV trajectories and significantly improve the data throughput of the FANET
over the adaptive local minimum spanning tree (A-LMST) and cyclic
pruning-assisted power optimization (CPAPO) methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Life sciences research increasingly requires identifying, accessing, and
effectively processing data from an ever-evolving array of information sources
on the Linked Open Data (LOD) network. This dynamic landscape places a
significant burden on researchers, as the quality of query responses depends
heavily on the selection and semantic integration of data sources --processes
that are often labor-intensive, error-prone, and costly. While the adoption of
FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles has
aimed to address these challenges, barriers to efficient and accurate
scientific data processing persist.
  In this paper, we introduce FAIRBridge, an experimental natural
language-based query processing system designed to empower scientists to
discover, access, and query biological databases, even when they are not
FAIR-compliant. FAIRBridge harnesses the capabilities of AI to interpret query
intents, map them to relevant databases described in scientific literature, and
generate executable queries via intelligent resource access plans. The system
also includes robust tools for mitigating low-quality query processing,
ensuring high fidelity and responsiveness in the information delivered.
  FAIRBridge's autonomous query processing framework enables users to explore
alternative data sources, make informed choices at every step, and leverage
community-driven crowd curation when needed. By providing a user-friendly,
automated hypothesis-testing platform in natural English, FAIRBridge
significantly enhances the integration and processing of scientific data,

<p class='card-text'>Accurate reconstruction of the environment is a central goal of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. However, the agent's trajectory can
significantly affect estimation accuracy. This paper presents a new method to
model map uncertainty in Active SLAM systems using an Uncertainty Map (UM). The
UM uses probability distributions to capture where the map is uncertain,
allowing Uncertainty Frontiers (UF) to be defined as key
exploration-exploitation objectives and potential stopping criteria. In
addition, the method introduces the Signed Relative Entropy (SiREn), based on
the Kullback-Leibler divergence, to measure both coverage and uncertainty
together. This helps balance exploration and exploitation through an
easy-to-understand parameter. Unlike methods that depend on particular SLAM
setups, the proposed approach is compatible with different types of sensors,
such as cameras, LiDARs, and multi-sensor fusion. It also addresses common
problems in exploration planning and stopping conditions. Furthermore,
integrating this map modeling approach with a UF-based planning system enables
the agent to autonomously explore open spaces, a behavior not previously
observed in the Active SLAM literature. Code and implementation details are
available as a ROS node, and all generated data are openly available for public
use, facilitating broader adoption and validation of the proposed approach.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Exploring the outer reaches of the Solar System presents significant
propulsion and mission design challenges. This study assesses the feasibility
of a mission to Sedna using two advanced propulsion concepts: the Direct Fusion
Drive (DFD) rocket engine, based on D-$^{3}$He thermonuclear fusion, and a
solar sail utilizing thermal desorption of its coating for propulsion. Both are
evaluated for a one-way Earth-to-Sedna mission; however, due to the different
performances the DFD would enable orbit insertion, whereas for the solar sail a
flyby is envisioned. The analysis evaluates key mission parameters, including
delivered payload capacity, travel time, and potential science return. For the
DFD, we assume a 1.6 MW system with constant thrust and specific impulse, while
for the solar sail, we consider acceleration via thermal desorption and a
gravity-assist maneuver around Jupiter. The mission analysis incorporates four
key phases: departure, interplanetary acceleration, interplanetary coasting,
and rendezvous. Sedna is expected to pass through the perihelion of its orbit
in 2075--2076 and then move again away from the Sun. Considering the distances
involved, a mission targeting the object would need to be launched "relatively"
soon, especially if using conventional propulsion systems, which could require
up to 30 years of deep-space travel. In our study, results indicate that the
DFD could reach Sedna in approximately 10 years, with 1.5 years of thrusting,
while the solar sail, assisted by Jupiter's gravity, could complete the journey
in 7 years. The feasibility of science payload accommodation, power
availability, and communication constraints is also considered. These findings
provide a comparative foundation for future deep-space mission planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate segmentation of Pelvic Radiation Injury (PRI) from Magnetic
Resonance Images (MRI) is crucial for more precise prognosis assessment and the
development of personalized treatment plans. However, automated segmentation
remains challenging due to factors such as complex organ morphologies and
confusing context. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pattern
Divide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net) for PRI segmentation. The core idea is to
use different network modules to "divide" various local and global patterns
and, through flexible feature selection, to "conquer" the Regions of Interest
(ROI) during the decoding phase. Specifically, considering that our ROI often
manifests as strip-like or circular-like structures in MR slices, we introduce
a Multi-Direction Aggregation (MDA) module. This module enhances the model's
ability to fit the shape of the organ by applying strip convolutions in four
distinct directions. Additionally, to mitigate the challenge of confusing
context, we propose a Memory-Guided Context (MGC) module. This module
explicitly maintains a memory parameter to track cross-image patterns at the
dataset level, thereby enhancing the distinction between global patterns
associated with the positive and negative classes. Finally, we design an
Adaptive Fusion Decoder (AFD) that dynamically selects features from different
patterns based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, ultimately generating
the final segmentation results. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale
pelvic radiation injury dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of
our PDC-Net over existing approaches.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the

followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various
complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary
significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms,
representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for
researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components

series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive
suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and
deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and
real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results
demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally
better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm
generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on
task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and
continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference

Their use as a resonant-mass strain antenna for high-frequency gravitational
