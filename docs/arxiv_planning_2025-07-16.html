  Learning Compiler Techniques</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Yiqi Liu, Yuqi Xue, Noelle Crawford, Jilong Xue, Jian Huang</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-15 17:21:31</h6>
<p class='card-text'>To meet the increasing demand of deep learning (DL) models, AI chips are
employing both off-chip memory (e.g., HBM) and high-bandwidth low-latency
interconnect for direct inter-core data exchange. However, it is not easy to
explore the efficiency of these inter-core connected AI (ICCA) chips, due to a
fundamental tussle among compute (per-core execution), communication
(inter-core data exchange), and I/O (off-chip data access).
  In this paper, we develop Elk, a DL compiler framework to maximize the
efficiency of ICCA chips by jointly trading off all the three performance
factors discussed above. Elk structures these performance factors into
configurable parameters and forms a global trade-off space in the DL compiler.
To systematically explore this space and maximize overall efficiency, Elk
employs a new inductive operator scheduling policy and a cost-aware on-chip
memory allocation algorithm. It generates globally optimized execution plans
that best overlap off-chip data loading and on-chip execution. To examine the
efficiency of Elk, we build a full-fledged emulator based on a real ICCA chip
IPU-POD4, and an ICCA chip simulator for sensitivity analysis with different
interconnect network topologies. Elk achieves 94% of the ideal roofline
performance of ICCA chips on average, showing the benefits of supporting large
DL models on ICCA chips. We also show Elk's capability of enabling architecture
design space exploration for new ICCA chip development.</p>

  Modulo Theories: A Scalable Approach to Routing and Vehicle Circulation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Florian Fuchs, Bernardo Martin-Iradi, Francesco Corman</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-15 17:02:03</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper introduces a novel approach for jointly solving the periodic Train
Timetabling Problem (TTP), train routing, and Vehicle Circulation Problem (VCP)
through a unified optimization model. While these planning stages are
traditionally addressed sequentially, their interdependencies often lead to
suboptimal vehicle usage. We propose the VCR-PESP, an integrated formulation
that minimizes fleet size while ensuring feasible and infrastructure-compliant
periodic timetables. We present the first Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT)-based method for the VCR-PESP to solve the resulting large-scale
instances. Unlike the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT), which requires time
discretisation, SMT supports continuous time via difference constraints,
eliminating the trade-off between temporal precision and encoding size. Our
approach avoids rounding artifacts and scales effectively, outperforming both
SAT and Mixed Integer Program (MIP) models across non-trivial instances. Using
real-world data from the Swiss narrow-gauge operator RhB, we conduct extensive
experiments to assess the impact of time discretisation, vehicle circulation
strategies, route flexibility, and planning integration. We show that discrete
models inflate vehicle requirements and that fully integrated solutions
substantially reduce fleet needs compared to sequential approaches. Our
framework consistently delivers high-resolution solutions with tractable
runtimes, even in large and complex networks. By combining modeling accuracy
with scalable solver technology, this work establishes SMT as a powerful tool
for integrated railway planning. It demonstrates how relaxing discretisation
and solving across planning layers enables more efficient and implementable
timetables.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-15 16:45:43</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Accurate characterization of vascular geometry is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional statistical shape
modeling (SSM) methods rely on linear assumptions, limiting their expressivity
and scalability to complex topologies such as multi-branch vascular structures.
We introduce HUG-VAS, a Hierarchical NURBS Generative model for Vascular
geometry Synthesis, which integrates NURBS surface parameterization with
diffusion-based generative modeling to synthesize realistic, fine-grained
aortic geometries. Trained with 21 patient-specific samples, HUG-VAS generates
anatomically faithful aortas with supra-aortic branches, yielding biomarker
distributions that closely match those of the original dataset. HUG-VAS adopts
a hierarchical architecture comprising a denoising diffusion model that
generates centerlines and a guided diffusion model that synthesizes radial
profiles conditioned on those centerlines, thereby capturing two layers of
anatomical variability. Critically, the framework supports zero-shot
conditional generation from image-derived priors, enabling practical
applications such as interactive semi-automatic segmentation, robust
reconstruction under degraded imaging conditions, and implantable device
optimization. To our knowledge, HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to bridge
image-derived priors with generative shape modeling via a unified integration
of NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion processes.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Ajay Shankar, Keisuke Okumura, Amanda Prorok</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-15 16:35:37</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We propose a multi-robot control paradigm to solve point-to-point navigation
tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment
information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high
frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing
collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in
multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal
trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their
assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation
from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables
the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an
instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast
state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack
(Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and
versatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous
and partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick
replanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations,
including the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target
updates while a person walks through the operational workspace.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The RoboCup Logistics League is a RoboCup competition in a smart factory
scenario that has focused on task planning, job scheduling, and multi-agent
coordination. The focus on production logistics allowed teams to develop highly
competitive strategies, but also meant that some recent developments in the
context of smart manufacturing are not reflected in the competition, weakening
its relevance over the years. In this paper, we describe the vision for the
RoboCup Smart Manufacturing League, a new competition designed as a larger
smart manufacturing scenario, reflecting all the major aspects of a modern
factory. It will consist of several tracks that are initially independent but
gradually combined into one smart manufacturing scenario. The new tracks will
cover industrial robotics challenges such as assembly, human-robot
collaboration, and humanoid robotics, but also retain a focus on production
logistics. We expect the reenvisioned competition to be more attractive to
newcomers and well-tried teams, while also shifting the focus to current and

  Considering Regional Dunkelflaute Events</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-15 14:28:23</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This study develops a capacity expansion model for a fully decarbonized
European electricity system using an Adaptive Robust Optimization (ARO)
framework. The model endogenously identifies the worst regional Dunkelflaute
events, prolonged periods of low wind and solar availability, and incorporates
multiple extreme weather realizations within a single optimization run. Results
show that system costs rise nonlinearly with the geographic extent of these
events: a single worst-case regional disruption increases costs by 9%, but
broader disruptions across multiple regions lead to much sharper increases, up
to 51%. As Dunkelflaute conditions extend across most of Europe, additional
cost impacts level off, with a maximum increase of 71%. The optimal technology
mix evolves with the severity of weather stress: while renewables, batteries,
and interregional transmission are sufficient to manage localized events,
large-scale disruptions require long-term hydrogen storage and load shedding to
maintain system resilience. Central European regions, especially Germany and
France, emerge as systemic bottlenecks, while peripheral regions bear the cost
of compensatory overbuilding. These findings underscore the need for a
coordinated European policy strategy that goes beyond national planning to
support cross-border infrastructure investment, scale up flexible technologies
such as long-duration storage, and promote a geographically balanced deployment
of renewables to mitigate systemic risks associated with Dunkelflaute events.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for
reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to
complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited
annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions
Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity
Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically
combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a
wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a
biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature
enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained
and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate
uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and
lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without
sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate
that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an
average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap
error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the

<p class='card-text'>Fluvial erosion is a natural process that can generate significant impacts on
soil stability and strategic infrastructures. The detection and monitoring of
this phenomenon is traditionally addressed by photogrammetric methods and
analysis in geographic information systems. These tasks require specific
knowledge and intensive manual processing. This study proposes an artificial
intelligence-based approach for automatic identification of eroded zones and
estimation of their area. The state-of-the-art computer vision model YOLOv11,
adjusted by fine-tuning and trained with photographs and LiDAR images, is used.
This combined dataset was segmented and labeled using the Roboflow platform.
Experimental results indicate efficient detection of erosion patterns with an
accuracy of 70%, precise identification of eroded areas and reliable
calculation of their extent in pixels and square meters. As a final product,
the EROSCAN system has been developed, an interactive web application that
allows users to upload images and obtain automatic segmentations of fluvial

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-07-15 10:27:27</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely on global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) pseudorange measurements for accurate real-time
localization and navigation. However, this dependence exposes them to
sophisticated spoofing threats, where adversaries manipulate pseudoranges to
deceive UAV receivers. Among these, drift-evasive spoofing attacks subtly
perturb measurements, gradually diverting the UAVs trajectory without
triggering conventional signal-level anti-spoofing mechanisms. Traditional
distributional shift detection techniques often require accumulating a
threshold number of samples, causing delays that impede rapid detection and
timely response. Consequently, robust temporal-scale detection methods are
essential to identify attack onset and enable contingency planning with
alternative sensing modalities, improving resilience against stealthy
adversarial manipulations. This study explores a Bayesian online change point
detection (BOCPD) approach that monitors temporal shifts in value estimates
from a reinforcement learning (RL) critic network to detect subtle behavioural
deviations in UAV navigation. Experimental results show that this temporal
value-based framework outperforms conventional GNSS spoofing detectors,
temporal semi-supervised learning frameworks, and the Page-Hinkley test,
achieving higher detection accuracy and lower false-positive and false-negative
rates for drift-evasive spoofing attacks.</p>

integrating human decision-making with autonomous robotic functions, the

key task addressed is the autonomous deployment of flexible solar panels using
an extendable ladder-like structure and a robotic manipulator with real-time

enabling dynamic error detection and adaptive control during deployment. To
mitigate the effects of sinkage, variable payload, and low-lighting conditions,
efficient motion planning strategies are employed, supplemented by human

<p class='card-text'>Offset surfaces, defined as the Minkowski sum of a base surface and a rolling
ball, play a crucial role in geometry processing, with applications ranging
from coverage motion planning to brush modeling. While considerable progress
has been made in computing constant-radius offset surfaces, computing
variable-radius offset surfaces remains a challenging problem. In this paper,
we present OffsetCrust, a novel framework that efficiently addresses the
variable-radius offsetting problem by computing a power diagram. Let $R$ denote
the radius function defined on the base surface $S$. The power diagram is
constructed from contributing sites, consisting of carefully sampled base
points on $S$ and their corresponding off-surface points, displaced along
$R$-dependent directions. In the constant-radius case only, these displacement
directions align exactly with the surface normals of $S$. Moreover, our method
mitigates the misalignment issues commonly seen in crust-based approaches
through a lightweight fine-tuning procedure. We validate the accuracy and
efficiency of OffsetCrust through extensive experiments, and demonstrate its
practical utility in applications such as reconstructing original boundary
surfaces from medial axis transform (MAT) representations.</p>

regional inventory planning, especially when using Reinforcement Learning (RL)
to develop control policies. For the RL usecase, a drain model is incorporated
into a simulator to produce long rollouts, which we desire to be
differentiable. While simulating the calls to the internal software systems can
be used to recover this transition, they are non-differentiable and too slow
and costly to run within an RL training environment. Accordingly, we frame this
as a probabilistic forecasting problem, modeling the joint distribution of
outbound drain and shipping costs across all warehouses at each time period,
conditioned on inventory positions and exogenous customer demand. To ensure
robustness in an RL environment, the model must handle out-of-distribution
scenarios that arise from off-policy trajectories. We propose a validation
scheme that leverages production systems to evaluate the drain model on
counterfactual inventory states induced by RL policies. Preliminary results
demonstrate the model's accuracy within the in-distribution setting.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We study the Shortest-Walk Problem (SWP) in a Graph of Convex Sets (GCS). A
GCS is a graph where each vertex is paired with a convex program, and each edge
couples adjacent programs via additional costs and constraints. A walk in a GCS
is a sequence of vertices connected by edges, where vertices may be repeated.
The length of a walk is given by the cumulative optimal value of the
corresponding convex programs. To solve the SWP in GCS, we first synthesize a
piecewise-quadratic lower bound on the problem's cost-to-go function using
semidefinite programming. Then we use this lower bound to guide an
incremental-search algorithm that yields an approximate shortest walk. We show
that the SWP in GCS is a natural language for many mixed discrete-continuous
planning problems in robotics, unifying problems that typically require
specialized solutions while delivering high performance and computational
efficiency. We demonstrate this through experiments in collision-free motion
planning, skill chaining, and optimal control of hybrid systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,
their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and
active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent
perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action
dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such
as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment
interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and
long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset
of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic
environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.
The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,
object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a
multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level
instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express
the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to
evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key
dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage
Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below
20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current
limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of
EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning
followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial
improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's
effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p class='card-text'>World models (WMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in prediction, generation,
and planning tasks. Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data and
cannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in
the digital world. While multiple graph foundation models have been proposed,
they focus on graph learning tasks and cannot extend to diverse multi-modal
data and interdisciplinary tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the
Graph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and
graph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse
tasks as actions. The core of a GWM is a generic message-passing algorithm to
aggregate structured information, either over a unified multi-modal token space
by converting multi-modal data into text (GWM-T) or a unified multi-modal
embedding space by modality-specific encoders (GWM-E). Notably, GWM introduces
action nodes to support diverse tasks, where action nodes are linked to other
nodes via direct reference or similarity computation. Extensive experiments on
six tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching,
recommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation,
and planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches
domain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and
demonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks. Our
code for GWM is released at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GWM.</p>

<p class='card-text'>One in three women globally experiences intimate partner violence (IPV), yet
little is known about how such trauma affects economic decision-making. We
provide causal evidence that IPV influences women's time preferences - a key
parameter in models of savings, investment, and labor supply. We combine two
empirical strategies using four distinct datasets. First, in two randomized
recall experiments in Ethiopia, we randomly assigned women to recall specific
acts of abuse before eliciting their intertemporal choices. Women with IPV
experiences prompted to recall IPV display significantly greater impatience
than otherwise similar women who are not prompted. Second, we exploit exogenous
reductions in IPV generated by two randomized interventions - one involving
cash transfers, the other psychotherapy - and use treatment assignment as an
instrument for IPV exposure. Women who experience reduced IPV as a result of
treatment exhibit more patient time preferences. Together, these results
provide consistent, novel causal evidence that exposure to IPV induces
individuals to discount the future more heavily. This evidence suggests a
psychological channel through which violence can perpetuate economic
disadvantage and constrain women's ability to take actions - such as saving,
investing, or exiting abusive relationships - that require planning over time.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Optimization has been widely used to generate smooth trajectories for motion
planning. However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when
dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel
computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently
solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this
paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the
Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which
decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in
parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per
iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that
integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the
optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality
constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness.
Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving
over a tenfold speedup. To fully explore the potential of our algorithm on
modern parallel computing architectures, we deploy our framework on a GPU and
show high performance with thousands of segments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>TRIDENT is a planned multi-cubic-kilometer deep-sea neutrino telescope to be
built in the South China Sea, designed to rapidly discover high-energy
astrophysical neutrino sources with sensitivity to all neutrino flavors.
Achieving this at scale requires a detector design that balances performance
with power, cost, and mechanical simplicity. This study presents a
cost-effective optimization of TRIDENT's hybrid Digital Optical Module (hDOM)
design, comparing configurations using high-quantum-efficiency (QE) 3-inch PMTs
and larger 4-inch PMTs, the latter evaluated with both baseline and enhanced QE
assumptions. Using full-chain detector simulations incorporating site-specific
seawater optical properties and realistic backgrounds, we assess performance in
all-flavor neutrino detection efficiency, directional reconstruction, and tau
neutrino flavor identification from 1 TeV to 10 PeV. We find that if 4-inch
PMTs can achieve QE comparable to 3-inch PMTs, their performance matches or
improves upon that of the 3-inch design, while significantly reducing channel
count, power consumption, and cost. These findings support the 4-inch PMT hDOM
as a promising and scalable choice for TRIDENT's future instrumentation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Inspection of complex underwater structures with tethered underwater vehicles
is often hindered by the risk of tether entanglement. We propose REACT
(real-time entanglement-aware coverage path planning for tethered underwater
vehicles), a framework designed to overcome this limitation. REACT comprises a
fast geometry-based tether model using the signed distance field (SDF) map for
accurate, real-time simulation of taut tether configurations around arbitrary
structures in 3D. This model enables an efficient online replanning strategy by
enforcing a maximum tether length constraint, thereby actively preventing
entanglement. By integrating REACT into a coverage path planning framework, we
achieve safe and optimal inspection paths, previously challenging due to tether
constraints. The complete REACT framework's efficacy is validated in a pipe
inspection scenario, demonstrating safe, entanglement-free navigation and
full-coverage inspection. Simulation results show that REACT achieves complete
coverage while maintaining tether constraints and completing the total mission
20% faster than conventional planners, despite a longer inspection time due to
proactive avoidance of entanglement that eliminates extensive post-mission
disentanglement. Real-world experiments confirm these benefits, where REACT
completes the full mission, while the baseline planner fails due to physical
tether entanglement.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This research introduces MP-RBFN, a novel formulation leveraging Radial Basis
Function Networks for efficiently learning Motion Primitives derived from
optimal control problems for autonomous driving. While traditional motion
planning approaches based on optimization are highly accurate, they are often
computationally prohibitive. In contrast, sampling-based methods demonstrate
high performance but impose constraints on the geometric shape of trajectories.
MP-RBFN combines the strengths of both by coupling the high-fidelity trajectory
generation of sampling-based methods with an accurate description of vehicle
dynamics. Empirical results show compelling performance compared to previous
methods, achieving a precise description of motion primitives at low inference
times. MP-RBFN yields a seven times higher accuracy in generating optimized
motion primitives compared to existing semi-analytic approaches. We demonstrate
the practical applicability of MP-RBFN for motion planning by integrating the
method into a sampling-based trajectory planner. MP-RBFN is available as

<p class='card-text'>Brain tumor segmentation plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis and

this, we propose the Edge Iterative MRI Lesion Localization System
(EdgeIMLocSys), which integrates Continuous Learning from Human Feedback to
adaptively fine-tune segmentation models based on clinician feedback, thereby
enhancing robustness to scanner-specific imaging characteristics. Central to
this system is the Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Lightweight Network for
Brain Tumor Segmentation (GMLN-BTS), which employs a Modality-Aware Adaptive
Encoder (M2AE) to extract multi-scale semantic features efficiently, and a
Graph-based Multi-Modal Collaborative Interaction Module (G2MCIM) to model
complementary cross-modal relationships via graph structures. Additionally, we
introduce a novel Voxel Refinement UpSampling Module (VRUM) that
synergistically combines linear interpolation and multi-scale transposed
convolutions to suppress artifacts while preserving high-frequency details,
improving segmentation boundary accuracy. Our proposed GMLN-BTS model achieves
a Dice score of 85.1% on the BraTS2017 dataset with only 4.58 million
parameters, representing a 98% reduction compared to mainstream 3D Transformer
models, and significantly outperforms existing lightweight approaches. This
work demonstrates a synergistic breakthrough in achieving high-accuracy,
