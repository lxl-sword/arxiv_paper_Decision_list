<p class='card-text'>This study addresses the essential task of medical image segmentation, which
involves the automatic identification and delineation of anatomical structures
and pathological regions in medical images. Accurate segmentation is crucial in
radiology, as it aids in the precise localization of abnormalities such as
tumors, thereby enabling effective diagnosis, treatment planning, and
monitoring of disease progression. Specifically, the size, shape, and location
of tumors can significantly influence clinical decision-making and therapeutic
strategies, making accurate segmentation a key component of radiological
workflows. However, challenges posed by variations in MRI modalities, image
artifacts, and the scarcity of labeled data complicate the segmentation task
and impact the performance of traditional models. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised learning Multi-encoder nnU-Net
architecture designed to process multiple MRI modalities independently through
separate encoders. This approach allows the model to capture modality-specific
features before fusing them for the final segmentation, thus improving
accuracy. Our Multi-encoder nnU-Net demonstrates exceptional performance,
achieving a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 93.72%, which surpasses that
of other models such as vanilla nnU-Net, SegResNet, and Swin UNETR. By
leveraging the unique information provided by each modality, the model enhances
segmentation tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited annotated data.
Evaluations highlight the effectiveness of this architecture in improving tumor
segmentation outcomes.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We present the AI Cosmologist, an agentic system designed to automate
cosmological/astronomical data analysis and machine learning research
workflows. This implements a complete pipeline from idea generation to
experimental evaluation and research dissemination, mimicking the scientific
process typically performed by human researchers. The system employs
specialized agents for planning, coding, execution, analysis, and synthesis
that work together to develop novel approaches. Unlike traditional auto
machine-learning systems, the AI Cosmologist generates diverse implementation
strategies, writes complete code, handles execution errors, analyzes results,
and synthesizes new approaches based on experimental outcomes. We demonstrate
the AI Cosmologist capabilities across several machine learning tasks, showing
how it can successfully explore solution spaces, iterate based on experimental
results, and combine successful elements from different approaches. Our results
indicate that agentic systems can automate portions of the research process,
potentially accelerating scientific discovery. The code and experimental data
used in this paper are available on GitHub at
https://github.com/adammoss/aicosmologist. Example papers included in the

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-04 10:29:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The global behavior of the nuclear equation of state (EoS) is usually
investigated using finite nuclei (FN) data, along with constraints from
heavy-ion collisions and astrophysical observations of neutron star (NS)
properties. The FN constraints explicitly imposed through the binding energies
and charge radii of selected nuclei are found to significantly affect the EoS
across different densities. However, the high computational cost of these
constraints makes it challenging to extend the analysis to a broader set of
nuclei, particularly when the objective is not merely to obtain a single
optimized model but to systematically explore uncertainties in global modeling.
To overcome this challenge, we introduce NucleiML (NML), a machine learning
framework trained on ground-state FN properties obtained from mean-field
models. Integrated into a Bayesian inference approach, NML demonstrates high
accuracy and strong consistency with the underlying mean-field model. The NML
achieves around ten-fold computational speed-up, from $\sim 4.5$ hours to 30
minutes. Its predictive performance improves further as the number of nuclei in
the training data increases, which we plan to employ in extensive future
explorations.</p>

  Multi-Agent Systems</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-04 09:17:59</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Safety assurance in multi-agent systems with coupled dynamics is a
fundamental yet challenging problem, especially when agents exhibit uncertain
and state-dependent behaviors. Classical robust control often assumes
worst-case disturbances, leading to overly conservative actions. In this work,
we propose a learning-based framework that combines conformal prediction with
model predictive control (MPC) to ensure probabilistic safety under
action-level uncertainty. Unlike prior approaches that predict future states,
we directly model the control action of the uncontrollable agent as a
stochastic function of the joint state, trained via neural networks and
calibrated using conformal prediction. This enables us to construct dynamic,
probabilistically guaranteed reachable tubes for the uncontrollable agent.
These tubes are then embedded into an MPC formulation to synthesize control
actions for the controllable agent that ensure safe interactions over a finite
planning horizon. We provide formal stepwise and cumulative safety guarantees,
and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a pedestrian-vehicle
interaction scenario. Compared to baseline methods, our framework achieves
higher safety rates while maintaining high performance in terms of speed and
responsiveness.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-04 09:05:05</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Automated vehicles and logistics robots must often position themselves in
narrow environments with high precision in front of a specific target, such as
a package or their charging station. Often, these docking scenarios are solved
in two steps: path following and rough positioning followed by a high-precision
motion planning algorithm. This can generate suboptimal trajectories caused by
bad positioning in the first phase and, therefore, prolong the time it takes to
reach the goal. In this work, we propose a unified approach, which is based on
a Model Predictive Control (MPC) that unifies the advantages of Model
Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC) with a Cartesian MPC to reach a specific
goal pose. The paper's main contributions are the adaption of the dynamic
weight allocation method to reach path ends and goal poses inside driving
corridors, and the development of the so-called dynamic objective MPC. The
latter is an improvement of the dynamic weight allocation method, which can
inherently switch state-dependent from an MPCC to a Cartesian MPC to solve the
path-following problem and the high-precision positioning tasks independently
of the location of the goal pose seamlessly by one algorithm. This leads to
foresighted, feasible, and safe motion plans, which can decrease the mission
time and result in smoother trajectories.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-04 09:04:58</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Acyclic conjunctive queries form the backbone of most analytical workloads,
and have been extensively studied in the literature from both theoretical and
practical angles. However, there is still a large divide between theory and
practice. While the 40-year-old Yannakakis algorithm has strong theoretical
running time guarantees, it has not been adopted in real systems due to its
high hidden constant factor. In this paper, we strive to close this gap by
proposing Yannakakis+, an improved version of the Yannakakis algorithm, which
is more practically efficient while preserving its theoretical guarantees. Our
experiments demonstrate that Yannakakis+ consistently outperforms the original
Yannakakis algorithm by 2x to 5x across a wide range of queries and datasets.
  Another nice feature of our new algorithm is that it generates a traditional
DAG query plan consisting of standard relational operators, allowing
Yannakakis+ to be easily plugged into any standard SQL engine. Our system
prototype currently supports four different SQL engines (DuckDB, PostgreSQL,
SparkSQL, and AnalyticDB from Alibaba Cloud), and our experiments show that
Yannakakis+ is able to deliver better performance than their native query plans
on 160 out of the 162 queries tested, with an average speedup of 2.41x and a
maximum speedup of 47,059x.</p>

a UAS is low on energy, it autonomously returns to its initial position for a
safe landing, thus preventing potential battery damage. To accomplish this, an
energy-aware multicopter model is integrated into a path planning algorithm
based on model predictive control and mixed integer linear programming. Besides
factoring in energy consumption, the planning is improved by dynamically
defining feasible regions for each UAS to prevent obstacle corner-cutting or

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-04 08:19:40</h6>
<p class='card-text'>For safe and flexible navigation in multi-robot systems, this paper presents
an enhanced and predictive sampling-based trajectory planning approach in
complex environments, the Gradient Field-based Dynamic Window Approach
(GF-DWA). Building upon the dynamic window approach, the proposed method
utilizes gradient information of obstacle distances as a new cost term to
anticipate potential collisions. This enhancement enables the robot to improve
awareness of obstacles, including those with non-convex shapes. The gradient
field is derived from the Gaussian process distance field, which generates both
the distance field and gradient field by leveraging Gaussian process regression
to model the spatial structure of the environment. Through several obstacle
avoidance and fleet collision avoidance scenarios, the proposed GF-DWA is shown
to outperform other popular trajectory planning and control methods in terms of
safety and flexibility, especially in complex environments with non-convex

<p class='card-text'>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially multicopters, have recently
gained popularity for use in surveillance, monitoring, inspection, and search
and rescue missions. Their maneuverability and ability to operate in confined
spaces make them particularly useful in cluttered environments. For advanced
control and mission planning applications, accurate and resource-efficient
modeling of UAVs and their capabilities is essential. This study presents a
modular approach to multicopter modeling that considers vehicle dynamics,
energy consumption, and sensor integration. The power train model includes
detailed descriptions of key components such as the lithium-ion battery,
electronic speed controllers, and brushless DC motors. Their models are
validated with real test flight data. In addition, sensor models, including
LiDAR and cameras, are integrated to describe the equipment often used in
surveillance and monitoring missions. The individual models are combined into
an energy-aware multicopter model, which provide the basis for a companion
study on path planning for unmanned aircaft system (UAS) swarms performing
search and rescue missions in cluttered and dynamic environments. The flexible
modeling approach enables easy description of different UAVs in a heterogeneous
UAS swarm, allowing for energy-efficient operations and autonomous decision

<p class='card-text'>Generalizable robotic mobile manipulation in open-world environments poses
significant challenges due to long horizons, complex goals, and partial
observability. A promising approach to address these challenges involves
planning with a library of parameterized skills, where a task planner sequences
these skills to achieve goals specified in structured languages, such as
logical expressions over symbolic facts. While vision-language models (VLMs)
can be used to ground these expressions, they often assume full observability,
leading to suboptimal behavior when the agent lacks sufficient information to
evaluate facts with certainty. This paper introduces a novel framework that
leverages VLMs as a perception module to estimate uncertainty and facilitate
symbolic grounding. Our approach constructs a symbolic belief representation
and uses a belief-space planner to generate uncertainty-aware plans that
incorporate strategic information gathering. This enables the agent to
effectively reason about partial observability and property uncertainty. We
demonstrate our system on a range of challenging real-world tasks that require
reasoning in partially observable environments. Simulated evaluations show that
our approach outperforms both vanilla VLM-based end-to-end planning or
VLM-based state estimation baselines by planning for and executing strategic
information gathering. This work highlights the potential of VLMs to construct
belief-space symbolic scene representations, enabling downstream tasks such as
uncertainty-aware planning.</p>

multi-level token compression and hierarchical temporal processing to remain
computationally efficient without sacrificing temporal resolution. Evaluated on
a large-scale dataset from the Iowa Department of Transportation, HybridMamba

<p class='card-text'>The rapid advancement of foundation models has revolutionized visual
representation learning in a self-supervised manner. However, their application
in remote sensing (RS) remains constrained by a fundamental gap: existing
models predominantly handle single or limited modalities, overlooking the
inherently multi-modal nature of RS observations. Optical, synthetic aperture
radar (SAR), and multi-spectral data offer complementary insights that
significantly reduce the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty in single-source
analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce RingMoE, a unified multi-modal RS
foundation model with 14.7 billion parameters, pre-trained on 400 million
multi-modal RS images from nine satellites. RingMoE incorporates three key
innovations: (1) A hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
comprising modal-specialized, collaborative, and shared experts, effectively
modeling intra-modal knowledge while capturing cross-modal dependencies to
mitigate conflicts between modal representations; (2) Physics-informed
self-supervised learning, explicitly embedding sensor-specific radiometric
characteristics into the pre-training objectives; (3) Dynamic expert pruning,
enabling adaptive model compression from 14.7B to 1B parameters while
maintaining performance, facilitating efficient deployment in Earth observation
applications. Evaluated across 23 benchmarks spanning six key RS tasks (i.e.,
classification, detection, segmentation, tracking, change detection, and depth
estimation), RingMoE outperforms existing foundation models and sets new SOTAs,
demonstrating remarkable adaptability from single-modal to multi-modal

<p class='card-text'>Mission planning can often be formulated as a constrained control problem
under multiple path constraints (i.e., safety constraints) and budget
constraints (i.e., resource expenditure constraints). In a priori unknown
environments, verifying that an offline solution will satisfy the constraints

follows: 1) We propose an online method, building on our previous work
"gatekeeper", to guarantee safety and satisfy budget constraints of the system
trajectory at all times throughout a mission. 2) Next, we prove that our
algorithm is recursively feasible and correct. 3) Finally, instead of using a
heuristically designed backup controller, we propose a sampling-based method to
construct backup trajectories that both minimize resource expenditure and reach
budget renewal sets, in which path constraints are satisfied and the

<p class='card-text'>Path planning and optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted
next-generation wireless networks is critical for mobility management and
ensuring UAV safety and ubiquitous connectivity, especially in dense urban
environments with street canyons and tall buildings. Traditional statistical
and model-based techniques have been successfully used for path optimization in
communication networks. However, when dynamic channel propagation
characteristics such as line-of-sight (LOS), interference, handover, and
signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) are included in path
optimization, statistical and model-based path planning solutions become
obsolete since they cannot adapt to the dynamic and time-varying wireless
channels, especially in the mmWave bands. In this paper, we propose a novel
model-free actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (AC-DRL) framework for path
optimization in UAV-assisted 5G mmWave wireless networks, which combines four
important aspects of UAV communication: \textit{flight time, handover,
connectivity and SINR}. We train an AC-RL agent that enables a UAV connected to
a gNB to determine the optimal path to a desired destination in the shortest
possible time with minimal gNB handover, while maintaining connectivity and the
highest possible SINR. We train our model with data from a powerful ray tracing
tool called Wireless InSite, which uses 3D images of the propagation

  Segmentation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Feng Gao, Miao Fu, Jingchao Cao, Junyu Dong, Qian Du</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images plays a
crucial role in land-use monitoring and urban planning. Recent remarkable
progress in deep learning-based methods makes it possible to generate
satisfactory segmentation results. However, existing methods still face
challenges in adapting network parameters to various land cover distributions
and enhancing the interaction between spatial and frequency domain features. To
address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network
(AFENet), which integrates two key components: the Adaptive Frequency and
Spatial feature Interaction Module (AFSIM) and the Selective feature Fusion
Module (SFM). AFSIM dynamically separates and modulates high- and low-frequency
features according to the content of the input image. It adaptively generates
two masks to separate high- and low-frequency components, therefore providing
optimal details and contextual supplementary information for ground object
feature representation. SFM selectively fuses global context and local detailed
features to enhance the network's representation capability. Hence, the
interactions between frequency and spatial features are further enhanced.
Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the
proposed AFENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also
validate the effectiveness of AFSIM and SFM in managing diverse land cover
types and complex scenarios. Our codes are available at
https://github.com/oucailab/AFENet.</p>

regarding the homotopy category of flat modules to study
${\mathbb{K}}({S\rm{SF}}\mbox{-}R)$, the homotopy category of $S$-strongly flat

$R$. The category ${\mathbb{K}}({S\rm{SF}}\mbox{-}R)$ is an intermediate
triangulated category that includes ${\mathbb{K}}({\rm{Prj}\mbox{-}} R)$, the
homotopy category of projective $R$-modules, which is always well generated by
a result of Neeman, and is included in ${\mathbb{K}}({\rm{Flat}}\mbox{-} R)$,
the homotopy category of flat $R$-modules, which is well generated if and only
if $R$ is perfect, by a result of \v{S}\'{t}ov\'{i}\v{c}ek. We analyze
corresponding inclusion functors and the existence of their adjoints. In this
way, we provide a new, fully faithful embedding of the homotopy category of

the notion of $S$-almost well generated triangulated categories. If $R$ is an
$S$-almost perfect ring, ${\mathbb{K}}({\rm{Flat}}\mbox{-} R)$ is $S$-almost

<p class='card-text'>While modeling multi-contact manipulation as a quasi-static mechanical
process transitioning between different contact equilibria, we propose
formulating it as a planning and optimization problem, explicitly evaluating
(i) contact stability and (ii) robustness to sensor noise. Specifically, we
conduct a comprehensive study on multi-manipulator control strategies, focusing
on dual-arm execution in a planar peg-in-hole task and extending it to the
Multi-Manipulator Multiple Peg-in-Hole (MMPiH) problem to explore increased
task complexity. Our framework employs Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to
parameterize desired trajectories and Black-Box Optimization (BBO) with a
comprehensive cost function incorporating friction cone constraints, squeeze
forces, and stability considerations. By integrating parallel scenario
training, we enhance the robustness of the learned policies. To evaluate the
friction cone cost in experiments, we test the optimal trajectories computed
for various contact surfaces, i.e., with different coefficients of friction.
The stability cost is analytical explained and tested its necessity in
simulation. The robustness performance is quantified through variations of hole
pose and chamfer size in simulation and experiment. Results demonstrate that
our approach achieves consistently high success rates in both the single

<p class='card-text'>In a complex environment, for a mobile robot to safely and collision - free
avoid all obstacles, it poses high requirements for its intelligence level.
Given that the information such as the position and geometric characteristics
of obstacles is random, the control parameters of the robot, such as velocity
and angular velocity, are also prone to random deviations. To address this
issue in the framework of the Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System,
this paper proposes a global path control scheme for mobile robots based on
deep learning. First of all, the dynamic equation of the mobile robot is
established. According to the linear velocity and angular velocity of the
mobile robot, its motion behaviors are divided into obstacle - avoidance
behavior, target - turning behavior, and target approaching behavior.
Subsequently, the neural network method in deep learning is used to build a
global path planning model for the robot. On this basis, a fuzzy controller is
designed with the help of a fuzzy control algorithm to correct the deviations
that occur during path planning, thereby achieving optimized control of the
robot's global path. In addition, considering edge computing optimization, the
proposed model can process local data at the edge device, reducing the
communication burden between the robot and the central server, and improving
the real time performance of path planning. The experimental results show that
for the mobile robot controlled by the research method in this paper, the
deviation distance of the path angle is within 5 cm, the deviation convergence
can be completed within 10 ms, and the planned path is shorter. This indicates
that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the global path planning
ability of mobile robots in the industrial Internet environment and promote the
collaborative operation of robots through edge computing optimization.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper presents an adaptive path planner for object search in
agricultural fields using UAVs. The path planner uses a high-altitude coverage
flight path and plans additional low-altitude inspections when the detection
network is uncertain. The path planner was evaluated in an offline simulation
environment containing real-world images. We trained a YOLOv8 detection network
to detect artificial plants placed in grass fields to showcase the potential of
our path planner. We evaluated the effect of different detection certainty
measures, optimized the path planning parameters, investigated the effects of
localization errors and different numbers of objects in the field. The YOLOv8
detection confidence worked best to differentiate between true and false
positive detections and was therefore used in the adaptive planner. The optimal
parameters of the path planner depended on the distribution of objects in the
field, when the objects were uniformly distributed, more low-altitude
inspections were needed compared to a non-uniform distribution of objects,
resulting in a longer path length. The adaptive planner proved to be robust
against localization uncertainty. When increasing the number of objects, the
flight path length increased, especially when the objects were uniformly
distributed. When the objects were non-uniformly distributed, the adaptive path
planner yielded a shorter path than a low-altitude coverage path, even with
high number of objects. Overall, the presented adaptive path planner allowed to
find non-uniformly distributed objects in a field faster than a coverage path
planner and resulted in a compatible detection accuracy. The path planner is

<p class='card-text'>Monitoring air quality and environmental conditions is crucial for public
health and effective urban planning. Current environmental monitoring
approaches often rely on centralized data collection and processing, which pose
significant privacy, security, and scalability challenges. Federated Learning
(FL) offers a promising solution to these limitations by enabling collaborative
model training across multiple devices without sharing raw data. This
decentralized approach addresses privacy concerns while still leveraging
distributed data sources. This paper provides a comprehensive review of FL
applications in air quality and environmental monitoring, emphasizing its
effectiveness in predicting pollutants and managing environmental data.
However, the paper also identifies key limitations of FL when applied in this
domain, including challenges such as communication overhead, infrastructure
demands, generalizability issues, computational complexity, and security
vulnerabilities. For instance, communication overhead, caused by the frequent
exchange of model updates between local devices and central servers, is a
notable challenge. To address this, future research should focus on optimizing
communication protocols and reducing the frequency of updates to lessen the
burden on network resources. Additionally, the paper suggests further research
directions to refine FL frameworks and enhance their applicability in
real-world environmental monitoring scenarios. By synthesizing findings from
existing studies, this paper highlights the potential of FL to improve air
quality management while maintaining data privacy and security, and it provides
valuable insights for future developments in the field.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The segmentation of pelvic fracture fragments in CT and X-ray images is
crucial for trauma diagnosis, surgical planning, and intraoperative guidance.
However, accurately and efficiently delineating the bone fragments remains a
significant challenge due to complex anatomy and imaging limitations. The
PENGWIN challenge, organized as a MICCAI 2024 satellite event, aimed to advance
automated fracture segmentation by benchmarking state-of-the-art algorithms on
these complex tasks. A diverse dataset of 150 CT scans was collected from
multiple clinical centers, and a large set of simulated X-ray images was
generated using the DeepDRR method. Final submissions from 16 teams worldwide
were evaluated under a rigorous multi-metric testing scheme. The top-performing
CT algorithm achieved an average fragment-wise intersection over union (IoU) of
0.930, demonstrating satisfactory accuracy. However, in the X-ray task, the
best algorithm attained an IoU of 0.774, highlighting the greater challenges
posed by overlapping anatomical structures. Beyond the quantitative evaluation,
the challenge revealed methodological diversity in algorithm design. Variations
in instance representation, such as primary-secondary classification versus
boundary-core separation, led to differing segmentation strategies. Despite
promising results, the challenge also exposed inherent uncertainties in
fragment definition, particularly in cases of incomplete fractures. These
findings suggest that interactive segmentation approaches, integrating human
decision-making with task-relevant information, may be essential for improving
model reliability and clinical applicability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>High-level decision-making for dynamical systems often involves performance
and safety specifications that are activated or deactivated depending on
conditions related to the system state and commands. Such decision-making
problems can be naturally formulated as optimization problems where these
conditional activations are regulated by discrete variables. However, solving
these problems can be challenging numerically, even on powerful computing
platforms, especially when the dynamics are nonlinear. In this work, we
consider decision-making for nonlinear systems where certain constraints, as
well as possible terms in the cost function, are activated or deactivated
depending on the system state and commands. We show that these problems can be
formulated either as mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) or as
mathematical programs with vanishing constraints (MPVCs), where the former
formulation involves discrete decision variables, whereas the latter relies on
continuous variables subject to structured nonconvex constraints. We discuss
the different solution methods available for both formulations and demonstrate
them on optimal trajectory planning problems in various aerospace applications.
Finally, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of the MINLP and MPVC
approaches through a focused case study on powered descent guidance with
divert-feasible regions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Urban environments significantly influence mental health outcomes, yet the
role of an effective framework for decision-making under deep uncertainty
(DMDU) for optimizing urban policies for stress reduction remains
underexplored. While existing research has demonstrated the effects of urban
design on mental health, there is a lack of systematic scenario-based analysis
to guide urban planning decisions. This study addresses this gap by applying
Scenario Discovery (SD) in urban planning to evaluate the effectiveness of
urban vegetation interventions in stress reduction across different urban
environments using a predictive model based on emotional responses collected
from a neuroscience-based outdoor experiment in Lisbon. Combining these
insights with detailed urban data from Copenhagen, we identify key intervention
thresholds where vegetation-based solutions succeed or fail in mitigating
stress responses. Our findings reveal that while increased vegetation generally
correlates with lower stress levels, high-density urban environments, crowding,
and individual psychological traits (e.g., extraversion) can reduce its
effectiveness. This work showcases our Scenario Discovery framework as a
systematic approach for identifying robust policy pathways in urban planning,
opening the door for its exploration in other urban decision-making contexts
where uncertainty and design resiliency are critical.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In this paper we detail the methods used for obstacle avoidance, path
planning, and trajectory tracking that helped us win the adult-sized,
autonomous humanoid soccer league in RoboCup 2024. Our team was undefeated for
all seated matches and scored 45 goals over 6 games, winning the championship
game 6 to 1. During the competition, a major challenge for collision avoidance
was the measurement noise coming from bipedal locomotion and a limited field of
view (FOV). Furthermore, obstacles would sporadically jump in and out of our
planned trajectory. At times our estimator would place our robot inside a hard
constraint. Any planner in this competition must also be be computationally
efficient enough to re-plan and react in real time. This motivated our approach
to trajectory generation and tracking. In many scenarios long-term and
short-term planning is needed. To efficiently find a long-term general path
that avoids all obstacles we developed DAVG (Dynamic Augmented Visibility
Graphs). DAVG focuses on essential path planning by setting certain regions to
be active based on obstacles and the desired goal pose. By augmenting the
states in the graph, turning angles are considered, which is crucial for a
large soccer playing robot as turning may be more costly. A trajectory is
formed by linearly interpolating between discrete points generated by DAVG. A
modified version of model predictive control (MPC) is used to then track this
trajectory called cf-MPC (Collision-Free MPC). This ensures short-term
planning. Without having to switch formulations cf-MPC takes into account the
robot dynamics and collision free constraints. Without a hard switch the
control input can smoothly transition in cases where the noise places our robot
inside a constraint boundary. The nonlinear formulation runs at approximately
120 Hz, while the quadratic version achieves around 400 Hz.</p>
