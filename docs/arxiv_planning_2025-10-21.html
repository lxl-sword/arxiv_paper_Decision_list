<p class='card-text'>Building robots that can perceive, reason, and act in dynamic, unstructured
environments remains a core challenge. Recent embodied systems often adopt a
dual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System
1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the
embodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and
decision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation
of the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution
success, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete
dimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of
cognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark
that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as
embodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation
pipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension,
perception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure
analysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure
realism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects,
and multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For
planning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework,
MLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether
predicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14
MLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction
comprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained
affordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a
comprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the
development of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in

<p class='card-text'>As information grows exponentially, enterprises face increasing pressure to
transform unstructured data into coherent, actionable insights. While
autonomous agents show promise, they often struggle with domain-specific
nuances, intent alignment, and enterprise integration. We present Enterprise
Deep Research (EDR), a multi-agent system that integrates (1) a Master Planning
Agent for adaptive query decomposition, (2) four specialized search agents
(General, Academic, GitHub, LinkedIn), (3) an extensible MCP-based tool
ecosystem supporting NL2SQL, file analysis, and enterprise workflows, (4) a
Visualization Agent for data-driven insights, and (5) a reflection mechanism
that detects knowledge gaps and updates research direction with optional
human-in-the-loop steering guidance. These components enable automated report
generation, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as
validated on internal datasets. On open-ended benchmarks including DeepResearch
Bench and DeepConsult, EDR outperforms state-of-the-art agentic systems without
any human steering. We release the EDR framework and benchmark trajectories to
advance research on multi-agent reasoning applications.

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-20 16:28:42</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have enabled the generation of
large ensembles of redistricting plans through graph partitioning. However,
existing algorithms such as Reversible Recombination (RevReCom) and
Metropolized Forest Recombination (MFR) are constrained to sampling from
distributions related to spanning trees. We introduce the marked edge walk
(MEW), a novel MCMC algorithm for sampling from the space of graph partitions
under a tunable distribution. The walk operates on the space of spanning trees
with marked edges, allowing for calculable transition probabilities for use in
the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Empirical results on real-world dual graphs
show convergence under target distributions unrelated to spanning trees. For
this reason, MEW represents an advancement in flexible ensemble generation.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Bama Srinivasan</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-20 16:06:53</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper presents a formal framework for sequencing instructions in AI
agents, inspired by the Indian philosophical system of Mimamsa. The framework
formalizes sequencing mechanisms through action object pairs in three distinct
ways: direct assertion (Srutikrama) for temporal precedence, purpose driven
sequencing (Arthakrama) for functional dependencies, and iterative procedures
(Pravrittikrama) for distinguishing between parallel and sequential execution
in repetitive tasks. It introduces the syntax and semantics of an action object
imperative logic, extending the MIRA formalism (Srinivasan and Parthasarathi,
2021) with explicit deduction rules for sequencing. The correctness of
instruction sequencing is established through a validated theorem, which is
based on object dependencies across successive instructions. This is further
supported by proofs of soundness and completeness. This formal verification
enables reliable instruction sequencing, impacting AI applications across areas
like task planning and robotics by addressing temporal reasoning and dependency
modeling.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Praphul Singh, Corey Barrett, Sumana Srivasta, Irfan Bulu, Sri Gadde, Krishnaram Kenthapadi</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-20 15:00:02</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Clinicians need ranking systems that work in real time and still justify
their choices. Motivated by the need for a low-latency, decoder-based reranker,
we present OG-Rank, a single-decoder approach that pairs a pooled first-token
scoring signal with an uncertainty-gated explanation step. The model scores all
candidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when
the list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a
curriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong
effectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45,
nDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56,
nDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains
under the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and
flexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain
when it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective
generation buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design
simplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend
more on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond
clinical order selection.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-20 13:45:50</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Swarm trajectory optimization problems are a well-recognized class of
multi-agent optimal control problems with strong nonlinearity. However, the
heuristic nature of needing to set the final time for agents beforehand and the
time-consuming limitation of the significant number of iterations prohibit the
application of existing methods to large-scale swarm of Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) in practice. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal
trajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based
on the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential
Dynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The
introduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP
(PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local
constraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all
UAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed
Parameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on
the spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce
the number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented
to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality increasing
the risk of stroke, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Imageless
electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) provides a non invasive alternative to
electrical mapping from body surface potentials, but conventional ECGI is
confined to epicardial reconstructions and can miss arrhythmias originating in
deeper myocardium. We address this by reconstructing three dimensional cardiac
activity with a volumetric formulation that solves an inverse source problem
via Green's functions, enabling full volume activation mapping and improved
localization in anatomically complex regions. We evaluate the approach on
simulated premature ventricular beats and on four challenging patient cases, a
right ventricular outflow tract premature ventricular contraction, a left
bundle branch block, a ventricular tachycardia, and Wolff Parkinson White, and
additionally assess performance on an open source myocardial infarction
dataset. Results show that volumetric ECGI recovers 3D activation and sharpens
arrhythmia origin localization, achieving a 59.3% reduction in geodesic error
between estimated and simulated origins relative to surface only methods; in
patient cases, activation patterns align with clinical diagnoses. Overall,
imageless volumetric ECGI offers accessible, non invasive 3D activation mapping
that overcomes a core limitation of surface restricted techniques and may
improve preprocedural planning, ablation target guidance, and selection or
optimization of cardiac resynchronization therapy.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Safe and efficient robotic navigation among humans is essential for
integrating robots into everyday environments. Most existing approaches focus
on simplified 2D crowd navigation and fail to account for the full complexity
of human body dynamics beyond root motion. We present HumanMPC, a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework for 3D Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) navigation
among humans that combines theoretical safety guarantees with data-driven
models for realistic human motion forecasting. Our approach introduces a novel
twist to reachability-based safety formulation that constrains only the initial
control input for safety while modeling its effects over the entire planning
horizon, enabling safe yet efficient navigation. We validate HumanMPC in both
simulated experiments using real human trajectories and in the real-world,
demonstrating its effectiveness across tasks ranging from goal-directed
navigation to visual servoing for human tracking. While we apply our method to
MAVs in this work, it is generic and can be adapted by other platforms. Our
results show that the method ensures safety without excessive conservatism and

<p class='card-text'>Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models
for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing
occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which
inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place
classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic
and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld,
a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient,
powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception
module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and
enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range
perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a
State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based
forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic
queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically
devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and

<p class='card-text'>We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous
control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to
maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an
evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation,
incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible
target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map
as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses
Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the
agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior
probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all
positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic
probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability
distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level
of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy,
we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step
toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the
challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their
objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over
declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely
on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated
plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this
limitation, we introduce $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner
explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems.
$\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define
semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes
meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models
directly into the search process, $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the
generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of
existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different
but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various
benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ generates
more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the
feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based
environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic,
non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Video-based representations have gained prominence in planning and

geometric relationships. These representations enable flexible and
generalizable solutions for complex tasks such as object manipulation and

to failures at interaction time due to their inability to reason about
uncertainties in partially observed environments. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce a novel framework that integrates interaction-time
data into the planning process. Our approach updates model parameters online
and filters out previously failed plans during generation. This enables
implicit state estimation, allowing the system to adapt dynamically without
explicitly modeling unknown state variables. We evaluate our framework through
extensive experiments on a new simulated manipulation benchmark, demonstrating
its ability to improve replanning performance and advance the field of

<p class='card-text'>The reliable execution of high-level missions in multi-robot systems with
heterogeneous agents, requires robust methods for detecting spurious behaviors.
In this paper, we address the challenge of identifying spurious executions of
plans specified as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula, as incorrect task
sequences, violations of spatial constraints, timing inconsis- tencies, or
deviations from intended mission semantics. To tackle this, we introduce a
structured data generation framework based on the Nets-within-Nets (NWN)
paradigm, which coordinates robot actions with LTL-derived global mission
specifications. We further propose a Transformer-based anomaly detection
pipeline that classifies robot trajectories as normal or anomalous. Experi-
mental evaluations show that our method achieves high accuracy (91.3%) in
identifying execution inefficiencies, and demonstrates robust detection
capabilities for core mission violations (88.3%) and constraint-based adaptive
anomalies (66.8%). An ablation experiment of the embedding and architecture was
carried out, obtaining successful results where our novel proposition performs
better than simpler representations.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Planetary exploration missions require robots capable of navigating extreme
and unknown environments. While wheeled rovers have dominated past missions,
their mobility is limited to traversable surfaces. Legged robots, especially
quadrupeds, can overcome these limitations by handling uneven, obstacle-rich,
and deformable terrains. However, deploying such robots in unknown conditions
is challenging due to the need for environment-specific control, which is
infeasible when terrain and robot parameters are uncertain. This work presents
a modular control framework that combines model-based dynamic control with
online model adaptation and adaptive footstep planning to address uncertainties
in both robot and terrain properties. The framework includes state estimation
for quadrupeds with and without contact sensing, supports runtime
reconfiguration, and is integrated into ROS 2 with open-source availability.
Its performance was validated on two quadruped platforms, multiple hardware
architectures, and in a volcano field test, where the robot walked over 700 m.</p>

<p class='card-text'>End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving robust and intelligent driving policies. However, existing end-to-end
methods still face significant challenges, such as suboptimal decision-making
in complex scenarios. In this paper,we propose SimpleVSF (Simple VLM-Scoring
Fusion), a novel framework that enhances end-to-end planning by leveraging the
cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and advanced trajectory
fusion techniques. We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel
VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative
aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware
decision-making. As the leading approach in the ICCV 2025 NAVSIM v2 End-to-End
Driving Challenge, our SimpleVSF framework demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance, achieving a superior balance between safety, comfort, and
efficiency.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Conventional end-to-end (E2E) driving models are effective at generating
physically plausible trajectories, but often fail to generalize to long-tail
scenarios due to the lack of essential world knowledge to understand and reason
about surrounding environments. In contrast, Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models leverage world knowledge to handle challenging cases, but their limited
3D reasoning capability can lead to physically infeasible actions. In this work
we introduce DiffVLA++, an enhanced autonomous driving framework that
explicitly bridges cognitive reasoning and E2E planning through metric-guided
alignment. First, we build a VLA module directly generating semantically
grounded driving trajectories. Second, we design an E2E module with a dense
trajectory vocabulary that ensures physical feasibility. Third, and most
critically, we introduce a metric-guided trajectory scorer that guides and
aligns the outputs of the VLA and E2E modules, thereby integrating their
complementary strengths. The experiment on the ICCV 2025 Autonomous Grand
Challenge leaderboard shows that DiffVLA++ achieves EPDMS of 49.12.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Existing approaches for transporting and manipulating cable-suspended loads
using multiple UAVs along reference trajectories typically rely on either
centralized control architectures or reliable inter-agent communication. In
this work, we propose a novel machine learning based method for decentralized
kinodynamic planning that operates effectively under partial observability and
without inter-agent communication. Our method leverages imitation learning to
train a decentralized student policy for each UAV by imitating a centralized
kinodynamic motion planner with access to privileged global observations. The
student policy generates smooth trajectories using physics-informed neural
networks that respect the derivative relationships in motion. During training,
the student policies utilize the full trajectory generated by the teacher
policy, leading to improved sample efficiency. Moreover, each student policy
can be trained in under two hours on a standard laptop. We validate our method
in both simulation and real-world environments to follow an agile reference
trajectory, demonstrating performance comparable to that of centralized
approaches.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We investigated the effects of scanning speed, beam configuration, and
dose-rate modeling on the FLASH effect in post-mastectomy proton
transmission-beam (TB) planning and evaluated whether optimizing the
spot-scanning path can enhance FLASH. Five left-sided post-mastectomy patients
(32 Gy in 5 fractions) were replanned with single-energy (249 MeV) tangential
TBs plus a clinical en face background beam. FLASH was evaluated with two
models: Krieger's FLASH effectiveness model (FEM) and Folkerts' average
dose-rate (ADR) framework. Plans used conventional pencil-beam scanning,
split-field delivery, and GA-optimized spot sequences, with vertical scan
speeds varied from 10 to 20 mm/ms. FLASH in normal tissues was defined as the
percentage of voxels meeting the threshold (>= 4 Gy at >= 40 Gy/s); once a
voxel met the criterion, a dose-adjustment factor of 0.67 was applied. The
FLASH effect was highly sensitive to scanning pattern and model choice.
Increasing vertical scan speed from 10 to 20 mm/ms increased FLASH in the CTV
by 22% (ADR) and 12% (FEM); in skin it rose from 41.4% to 58.8% (ADR) and from
8.4% to 13.1% (FEM). Split-field delivery increased the temporal separation
between vertical spot columns and yielded superior FLASH, including up to a 9.2
Gy reduction in CTV Dmean with ADR. GA-based optimization shortened scan time
and achieved FLASH comparable to split-field delivery, with a CTV Dmean
reduction of 7.87 Gy (ADR-GA) and skin Dmean reductions of 2-3 Gy. These
findings indicate that FLASH outcomes depend strongly on scanning trajectory,
scan speed, and model selection. In addition, path-minimizing spot-delivery
optimization (e.g., GA) can further improve dose-rate distributions in healthy
voxels.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Timely and effective decision-making is critical during epidemics to reduce
preventable infections and deaths. This demands integrated models that jointly
capture disease dynamics, vaccine distribution, regional disparities, and
behavioral responses. However, most existing approaches decouple epidemic
forecasting from logistics planning, hindering adaptive and regionally
responsive interventions. We propose a novel epidemiological-optimization
framework that jointly models epidemic progression and a multiscale vaccine
supply chain. The model incorporates spatio-temporally varying effective
infection rates to reflect regional policy and behavioral dynamics. It supports
coordinated, data-driven decision-making across spatial scales through two
formulations: a multi-objective Gini-based model and a knapsack-based model
that leverages regional vulnerability indicators for tractability and improved
mitigation. To address computational complexity, we design two scalable
heuristic decomposition algorithms inspired by the Benders decomposition. The
model is validated using COVID-19 data in the U.S.. We introduce SARIMA-based
forecasting as a novel approach for validating epidemic-optimization models
under data limitations. The results show that our approach can prevent more
than 2 million infections and 30,000 deaths in just six months while
significantly improving the accessibility of vaccines in underserved regions.
Our framework demonstrates that integrating fairness and epidemic dynamics with
vaccine logistics leads to superior outcomes compared to traditional myopic
policies. Fairness improves overall efficiency in the long term by prioritizing
the most vulnerable populations, leading to better long-term public health
outcomes. The model offers policymakers a scalable and operationally relevant
tool to strengthen preparedness and ensure a more effective and equitable
response to epidemics.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-19 18:26:46</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This study aims to improve the spatial representation of uncertainties when
regressing surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for
sub-seasonal forecasting. Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale
atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which
exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to
obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024)
demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve
ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but
this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency
adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex
relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while
maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer
promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study
evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification
mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models
distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space
sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models
are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts
to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that
probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty
representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic
model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion,
deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish
probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational
sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-19 16:34:41</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Purpose: To develop and evaluate a real-time method for automatic planning
and measurement of fetal femur length - an important indicator of antenatal
growth - during MRI. While routinely assessed by ultrasound, MRI-based femur
length measurements remain challenging due to bone-slice misalignment, fetal
motion, and the need for manual assessment. Methods: A low-latency 3D U-Net was
trained on 59 scans acquired at 0.55T (gestational age 18-40 weeks) to localise
the proximal and distal endpoints of the femur. These coordinates were employed
to automatically adapt a 30-second EPI sequence for in-plane femur coverage in
real-time. Retrospective evaluation was performed in 72 scans (19-39 weeks,
including 19 pathological cases), and real-time testing in 24 cases (17-39
weeks). Automated results were compared with manual expert annotations and, in
57/72 cases, with matched clinical ultrasound measurements. Precision was
evaluated against inter-observer variability and analysed across gestational
age and maternal BMI. Furthermore, bilateral femur length consistency was
evaluated. Results: Retrospective analysis demonstrated a mean endpoint
localisation error of 5.5 mm and femur length deviation of 3.0 mm. Among the
49/72 cases with both femora automatically extracted, the left-right difference
was 2.8+-2.7 mm. Precision was unaffected by maternal BMI (p>0.05), but
correlated with gestational age (p<0.05). Real-time planning and assessment
were successful in 22/24 cases, with a mean deviation of 4.2 mm. Conclusions: A
real-time, automated method for MRI-based femur length measurement was
developed, enabling precise, motion-robust, and operator-independent growth
assessment, supporting future large-scale evaluation in growth-compromised
pregnancies.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous AI agents, capable of complex planning and action, represent a
significant technological evolution beyond current generative tools. As these
systems become integrated into political and economic life, their distribution
and capabilities will be highly consequential. This paper introduces and
explores "agentic inequality" - the potential disparities in power,
opportunity, and outcomes stemming from differential access to, and
capabilities of, AI agents. We analyse the dual potential of this technology,
exploring how agents could both exacerbate existing divides and, under the
right conditions, serve as a powerful equalising force. To this end, the paper
makes three primary contributions. First, it establishes an analytical
framework by delineating the three core dimensions through which this
inequality can manifest: disparities in the availability, quality, and quantity
of agents. Second, it argues that agentic inequality is distinct from prior
technological divides. Unlike tools that primarily augment human abilities,
agents act as autonomous delegates, creating novel power asymmetries through
scalable goal delegation and direct agent-to-agent competition that are poised
to reshape outcomes across economic and socio-political spheres. Finally, it
provides a systematic analysis of the technical and socioeconomic drivers -
from model release strategies to market incentives - that will shape the
distribution of agentic power, concluding with a research agenda for navigating
the complex governance challenges ahead.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but
remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and
lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To
address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that

scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a
lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual
descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant
context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination,
GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable
modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual
modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit
topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large
graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and
consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods,

first, the Bayesian reliability acceptance sampling plan is obtained where the
decision criteria of accepting a lot is pre-fixed. For large samples, computing

obtained, where the decision function is arbitrary. The manufacturer can derive
an optimal decision function by minimizing the Bayes risk among all decision

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-10-19 06:45:37</h6>
<p class='card-text'>End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric
world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common
ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes,
which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds.
To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that
focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first
establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from
the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous
timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the
changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To
alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to
calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate
different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the
implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning
accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D
occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.</p>
